'Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes.',
'"We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said James A. Talcott of Boston\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.',
'Doctor Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University.',
'Average maturity of the funds\' investments lengthened by a day to forty one days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue\'s.',
'Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.',
'Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner.',
'The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, unimpeded by traffic or red lights.',
'The governor couldn\'t make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.',

'Then, in the guests\' honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis five hundred announcer for a ten-lap exhibition race.',
'Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric.',
'No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire, after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation, he said.',
'"That attracts attention... it was just another one of the risk factors" that led to the company\'s decision to withdraw from the bidding, he added.',
'The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until December thirty one of this year.',
'Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its nineteen eighty nine earnings by one dollar and fifty five cents a share.',
'For nineteen eighty eight, Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of seven hundred thirty seven point five million dollars, or three dollars and one cent a share.',
'The two point five billion dollars Byron one plant near Rockford, Illinois, was completed in nineteen eighty five.',
'In a disputed nineteen eighty five ruling, the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by forty nine million dollars to pay for the plant.',
'But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission\'s rate increase and found the rates illegal.',
'The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison\'s construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses.',
'The utility has been collecting for the plant\'s construction cost from its three point one million customers subject to a refund since nineteen eighty six.',
'"We didn\'t have much of a choice," Cray Computer\'s chief financial officer, Gregory Barnum, said in an interview.',
'"The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray three, and without him it could not be completed.',
'Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour."',
'Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research\'s decision to link its ninety eight point three million dollars promissory note to Mr. Cray\'s presence will complicate a valuation of the new company.',
'"It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor," said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Incorporated, Minneapolis.',
'"Cray Computer will be a concept stock," he said.',
'"You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don\'t."',
'Besides the designer\'s age, other risk factors for Mr. Cray\'s new company include the Cray three\'s tricky, unproven chip technology.',
'The SEC documents describe those chips, which are made of gallium arsenide, as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment.',
'In addition, the Cray three will contain sixteen processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer.',
'Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday.',
'Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about eleven thousand barrels a day.',
'The field has reserves of twenty one million barrels.',
'Reserves for the five new fields total fifty million barrels.',
'The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in US mortgage-based instruments, Fannie Mae\'s chairman, David O. Maxwell, said at a news conference.',
'He said more than ninety percent of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors.',
'The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong.',
'Earlier this year, Japanese investors snapped up a similar, five hundred seventy million dollars mortgage-backed securities mutual fund.',
'That fund was put together by Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank.',
'The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Company of the US and Japan\'s Daiwa Securities Company.',
'Behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition.',
'As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years, securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell.',
'And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it.',
'Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.',
'And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the US and Japan.',
'Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies.',
'But it doesn\'t take much to get burned.',
'Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.',
'Another concern: The funds\' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market.',
'When the stock market dropped nearly seven percent October thirteen, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about eighteen percent and the Spain Fund fell sixteen percent.',
'And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the nineteen eighty seven crash.',
'It\'s probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, some specialists say.',
'But some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling one hundred twenty percent premium.',
'It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to nineteen ninety two\'s European economic integration.',
'And several new funds that aren\'t even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums.',
'Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month.',
'Its index inched up to forty seven point six percent in October from forty six percent in September.',
'Any reading below fifty percent suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining.',
'By most measures, the nation\'s industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all.',
'Factory payrolls fell in September.',
'So did the Federal Reserve Board\'s industrial-production index.',
'"This conforms to the  soft landing  scenario," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.',
'"I don\'t see any signs that inventories are excessive."',
'A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession.',
'The government\'s construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Incorporated\'s FW Dodge Group.',
'Dodge reported an eight percent increase in construction contracts awarded in September.',
'The goverment counts money as it is spent; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded.',
'The government includes money spent on residential renovation; Dodge doesn\'t.',
'The report offered new evidence that the nation\'s export growth, though still continuing, may be slowing.',
'Only nineteen percent of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October, down from twenty seven percent in September.',
'And eight percent said export orders were down last month, compared with six percent the month before.',
'They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months.',
'Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating.',
'When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen, prices tend to rise.',
'Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen, but they included one newcomer: milk and milk powder.',
'"It\'s an odd thing to put on the list," Mr. Bretz noted.',
'He said that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.',
'They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high US exports of dry milk, coupled with very low import quotas.',
'In Singapore, a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants, department stores and sports centers or face a two hundred fifty dollars fine.',

'A Beijing food-shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex, the People\'s Daily said.',
'It said the man, whom it did not name, had been found to have the disease after hospital tests.',
'Once the disease was confirmed, all the man\'s associates and family were tested, but none have so far been found to have AIDS, the newspaper said.',
'The man had for a long time had" a chaotic sex life," including relations with foreign men, the newspaper said.',
'The Polish government increased home electricity charges by one hundred fifty percent and doubled gas prices.',
'The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices.',
'In happier news, South Korea, in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday, announced four hundred fifty million dollars in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government.',
'The Artist has his routine.',
'He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to.',
'At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home.',
'His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree.',
'He is his own man.',
'Who\'s telling the truth?',
'Everybody -- and nobody.',
'It\'s a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate.',
'Mr. Giuliani\'s campaign chairman, Peter Powers, says the Dinkins ad is" deceptive."',
'The other side, he argues," knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.',
'They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets, but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation."',
'Asia\'s other cash-rich countries are following Japan\'s lead and pumping capital into the region.',
'In Taiwan and South Korea, rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.',
'These nations, known as Asia\'s" little tigers," also are contributing to Southeast Asia\'s integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan\'s.',
'Because of budget constraints in Washington, the US encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region.',
'But it resists yielding political ground.',
'In the coming decade, analysts say, US-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region\'s economic behemoth.',
'Japan\'s swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.',
'In the past decade, Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.',
'In the nineteen nineties, spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen, these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.',
'To capture the investment, Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business.',
'She had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny.',
'"A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance....',
'At the end of World War two, Germany surrendered before Japan....',
'The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms."',
'Virtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.',
'In fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the forty questions in that section.',
'The student surrendered the notes, but not without a protest.',
'"My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test," he said.',
'The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.',
'Confronted, Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes.',
'She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers.',
'Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security.',
'In September, she pleaded guilty and paid a five hundred dollars fine.',
'Her alternative was ninety days in jail.',
'Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out "deadwood" in the school\'s faculty and restore safety, and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.',
'One was statewide school reform, which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.',
'Another was Nancy Yeargin, who came to Greenville in nineteen eighty five, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward.',
'Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct.',
'"I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation," she says.',
'"Only five of the forty questions were geography questions. The rest were history, sociology, finance -- subjects they never had."',
'Mr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair.',
'"Do I have much sympathy for her?" Mr. Watson asks.',
'"Not really.',
'I believe in the system.',
'I believe you have to use the system to change it.',
'What she did was like taking the law into your own hands."',
'To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs. Yeargin won widespread local support.',
'The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students, teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf.',
'Supportive callers decried unfair testing, not Mrs. Yeargin, on a local radio talk show on which she appeared.',
'But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores.',
'Says Gayle Key, a mathematics teacher," The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.',
'There may be others doing what she did."',
'The Nasdaq one hundred index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained one point three nine to four hundred forty six point six two.',
'The index of the one hundred largest Nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well, gaining one point two eight to four hundred forty nine point oh four.',
'But the broader Nasdaq bank index, which tracks thrift issues, jumped three point two three to four hundred thirty six point oh one.',
'Attorneys have argued since nineteen eighty five, when the law took effect, that they cannot provide information about clients who don\'t wish their identities to be known.',
'Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years, citing attorney-client privilege.',
'Until last week, the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms.',
'Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients, that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.',
'Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.',
'But they have obtained eight thousand, three hundred forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases.',
'Often, judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare, but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento, California.',
'On Tuesday, the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective December thirty one to join a San Francisco law firm.',
'The reason: the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise.',
'Judge Ramirez, forty four, said it is unjust for judges to make what they do.',
'"Judges are not getting what they deserve.',
'You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants... and nobody blinks an eye.',
'When you become a federal judge, all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum."',
'But Fujitsu, Japan\'s Number one computer maker, isn\'t alone.',
'NEC, one of its largest domestic competitors, said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since nineteen eighty seven.',
'In both cases, NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu, which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery.',
'All the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software.',
'The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior.',
'So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue.',
'But in one of the auctions in question, International Business Machines Corporation made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer, according to the municipality.',
'The low-ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate.',
'The thirty five point seven million dollars net loss equals eighty six cents a share.',
'Not counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of three point one million dollars, or seven cents a share.',
'A year earlier, it had profit of seven point five million dollars, or eighteen cents a share.',
'Revenue rose forty two percent to one hundred thirty three point seven million dollars from ninety four million dollars. en',
'The charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips.',
'Related to that decision, the company said it was converting its Santa Clara, California, factory to a research and development facility.',
'A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force.',
'But some of the TV stations that bought" Cosby" reruns for record prices two years ago aren\'t laughing much these days.',
'The reruns have helped ratings at many of the one eighty seven network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows.',
'But the ratings are considerably below expectations, and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire.',
'Viacom denies it\'s using pressure tactics.',
'"We\'re willing to negotiate," says Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing.',
'"We\'re offering this plan now because we feel it\'s the right time."',
'Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America\'s good guys and bad boys.',
'In one feature, called" In the Dumpster," editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender.',
'From an advertising standpoint, the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days.',
'That one hundred thirty million dollars, Mr. Sherwood said," gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid.',
'We are able to increase our price above the seventy dollars level if necessary."',
'He declined to say, however, how much Sea Containers might raise its price.',
'The department\'s roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing ten thousand pounds or less.',
'The roofs would be required to withstand a force of one point five times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.',
'During the test, the roof couldn\'t be depressed more than five inches.',
'Despite the economic slowdown, there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt.',
'As a result, Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit.',
'Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move.',
'--DASH ten billion dollars of thirty-year bonds, to be auctioned Thursday and to mature August fifteen, two thousand, nineteen.',
'The Treasury also said it plans to sell ten billion dollars in thirty six-day cash management bills on Thursday.',
'They will mature December twenty one.',
'Economic news had little effect on financial markets.',
'As expected, a national purchasing managers\' report indicated the nation\'s manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly.',
'The Federal Reserve\'s Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions across the country, indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth.',
'Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading.',
'Big Board volume totaled one hundred fifty four point two million shares.',
'Bond prices were up.',
'The Treasury\'s benchmark thirty-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or two dollars and fifty cents for each one thousand dollar of face amount.',
'The yield fell to seven point eight eight percent.',
'Late yesterday, Georgia Gulf said it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from" third parties" regarding business combinations.',
'Georgia Gulf said it hasn\'t eliminated any alternatives and that" discussions are being held with interested parties, and work is also continuing on other various transactions."',
'It didn\'t elaborate.',
'Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons, an aggressive and persistent investor, won\'t leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed.',
'"He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull," says Paul Leming, a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Company.',
'"He appears to be in it for the long haul."',
'Mr. Simmons and NL already own a nine point nine percent stake in Georgia Gulf.',
'That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time, the Japanese say, no matter how badly the US wants quick results.',
'For instance, at the first meeting the two sides couldn\'t even agree on basic data used in price discussions.',
'Since then, a team of about fifteen MITI and US Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.',
'By Monday, they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust.',
'In a joint-venture deal, Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo\'s bureaucratic maze.',
'It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.',
'At last count, Candela had sold four million dollars of its medical devices in Japan.',
'The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product.',
'"They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach," says Richard Olsen, a Candela vice president.',
'Indeed, for many Japanese trading companies, the favorite US small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use.',
'A host of electronics firms in California\'s Silicon Valley were financed with trading-company venture capital.',
'Profit, at least in the short term, is usually a secondary goal.',
'"Strategic objectives, not financial return, drive many of the deals," says a Venture Economics spokesman.',
'So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days.',
'For nearly a decade, banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans.',
'The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services.',
'Still, bankers expect packaging to flourish, primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs.',
'"These days, banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them," Ms. Moore says.',
'Some banks are already moving in that direction, according to Alvin T. Sale, marketing director at First Union Corporation in Charlotte.',
'First Union, he says, now has packages for seven customer groups.',
'Soon, it will split those into thirty.',
'As a Foster Corporate Parent, you\'ll be helping a neighborhood S. & L. in areas crucial to its survival.',

'Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself.',
'"The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church," he says.',
'"I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life."',
'Put another way, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay, some market analysts say.',
'They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S. & P. five hundred.',
'The figure is currently about three point three percent, up from three point two percent before the recent market slide.',
'Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below three percent.',
'One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor\'s of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.',
'A total of one hundred thirty nine companies raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from one hundred thirty eight a year ago, S. & P. said Wednesday.',
'That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace.',
'Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration.',

'And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week, US sources said.',
'Mr. Nixon was to leave China today.',

'I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful.',
'I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them.',
'The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush\'s job performance and eighty five percent of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush.',
'If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful, the positive view is even more newsworthy.',
'Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious, stereotyped perspective.',
'Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator.',
'First Commonwealth Securities Corporation, of New Orleans, and its president, Kenneth J. Canepa, also of New Orleans, consented to a ten thousand dollars fine.',
'Also, Mr. Canepa received a two-week suspension" in a principal capacity."',
'Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings that they had inaccurately represented the firm\'s net capital, maintained inaccurate books and records, and made other violations.',
'Mr. Canepa confirmed he had consented to the sanctions but declined to comment further.',
'The British also are scrutinizing program trades.',
'Index-arbitrage trading is" something we want to watch closely," an official at London\'s Stock Exchange said.',
'"We don\'t think there is cause for concern at the moment."',
'Britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments.',
'A Financial Times-Stock Exchange one hundred-share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange\'s Traded Options Market.',
'And an FTSE futures contract is traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.',
'Both contracts have gained a following since the nineteen eighty seven global market crash.',
'But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks, demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on.',

'Moving rapidly through school, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age eighteen, after spending only two and one half years in college.',
'He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.',
'The formula has paid off, so far.',
'Georgia-Pacific\'s sales climbed to nine point five billion dollars last year, compared with six billion dollars in nineteen eighty three, when Mr. Hahn took the reins.',
'Profit from continuing operations has soared to four hundred sixty seven million dollars from seventy five million dollars.',
'Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best.',
'Nekoosa wouldn\'t be a diversification.',
'It would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say, of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.',
'The resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than thirteen billion dollars.',
'Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling.',
'Lids aren\'t even needed.',
'He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers.',
'A few fast-food outlets are giving it a try.',
'The company acknowledges some problems.',
'A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on, so the company supplies a window hook.',
'While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight, it isn\'t recyclable.',
'And unlike some trays, there\'s no place for food.',
'A USX spokesman said the company hadn\'t yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine.',
'"Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said.',
'"No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees."',
'Some of the homeless, obviously, had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.',
'But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets.',

'At least, that\'s the way it was reported.',
'And, indeed, the lawsuit was dismissed.',
'In August, the company took a three hundred forty three million dollars pretax charge against fiscal nineteen eighty nine earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan.',
'The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about three thousand, six hundred jobs.',
'But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing, especially in Europe, and there were signs that the board became impatient.',
'For fiscal nineteen eighty nine, Mr. McGovern received a salary of eight hundred seventy seven thousand, six hundred sixty three dollars.',
'He owns about forty five thousand shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than one hundred thousand additional shares.',
'He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than two hundred forty four thousand dollars with certain other fringe benefits.',
'Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early nineteen eighty eight.',
'"You\'ve got to make the restructuring work," said Mr. Baum.',
'"You\'ve got to make those savings now."',
'Mr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company.',
'"We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team," he said.',
'He predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive.',
'In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon, both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together.',

'Sometimes you just go with your gut."',
'Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until December thirty one and work with his successor, who is to be named soon.',
'Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isn\'t unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the US.',

'"The company is doing well, it\'s stable, it\'s got good people.',
'Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time."',
'This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional.',
'The appropriations clause states that" No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...."',
'The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.',
'This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in nineteen eighty seven in the Iran-Contra Report.',
'Section six hundred five also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president\'s ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.',
'The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person\'s salary.',
'The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government.',
'If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v..',
'Olson was for the Reagan administration.',
'But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.',
'Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice.',

'"It doesn\'t make any difference now."',
'The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.',
'They have begun sending letters explaining the program, which began October eighteen and will end December eighteen, to about five million card holders.',

'"I would like to go back to nineteen seventy.',

'Such program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds.',
'A program trade of five million dollars of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of twenty five thousand dollars.',
'To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find.',

'The start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move.',
'Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.',
'Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising, creating more volatility instead of less.',
'The speed of his transaction isn\'t to be feared either, because faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome.',
'If slowing things down could reduce volatility, stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future.',
'Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled" program-trading volatility" could be far worse than the perceived problem.',
'In using program trading as a whipping boy, fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products.',
'They may, however, risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves.',
'How does a nice new tax, say five percent, on any financial transaction sound?',
'That ought to make sure we\'re all thinking for the long term.',
'So what is next for program trading?',
'Left to its own devices, index arbitrage will become more and more efficient, making it harder and harder to do profitably.',
'Spreads will become so tight that it won\'t matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit.',
'The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.',

'DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.',
'Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.',

'As the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe, he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare.',

'But then Judge O\'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and, some say, an arrogant and abusive one.',
'While his case may be extreme, it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges.',
'Some of the allegations are simply bizarre.',
'Two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge\'s chambers on separate occasions to take dictation, only to find the judge in his bikini underwear.',
'One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all.',
'Certainly not the lawyers.',
'Johnstown attorney Richard J. Green Junior shelled out five hundred dollars in loans to the judge over five years, he said in testimony to the grand jury.',
'"The judge never made a pretense of repaying the money," said Mr. Green.',
'Eventually, Mr. Green testified, he began ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited.',
'Appalled, Mr. Green never paid the money, he testified.',

'But there is a risk, which the Japanese discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five years ago.',
'Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time, issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity.',
'That\'s a headache for long-term investors, since it forces them to reinvest their money -- usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried.',
'Compounding the trouble to Japanese investors, mortgage securities pay interest monthly, since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments.',
'But Japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments, so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems.',
'As a result, Japanese investors steered clear of the mortgage securities.',
'If the answers to these questions are affirmative, then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill.',
'However, the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted, they survive forever.',
'Although the current management team may be outstanding, who will be the CEO in ten years?',

'Secondly, the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications.',
'Finally, Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller\'s management beyond taking a place on the board.',
'Rockefeller isn\'t the first overseas purchase for Mitsubishi Estate -- it has already played a leading role in designing Los Angeles\'s Citicorp Plaza.',

'Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions.',
'But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner isn\'t expected to get any cash in the settlement.',
'Instead, Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of Sony\'s CBS Records unit.',
'Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company, but it doesn\'t have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS.',

'Chivas Class isn\'t the first such promotion.',
'Last year, J & B Scotch offered five hundred TWA frequent flier miles in exchange for a label.',
'And Dewar\'s gave discounts on Scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels.',
'Seagram says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking.',
'Seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a twelve-month period, says Richard Shaw, vice president of US direct marketing.',
'"We\'re not asking them to save up fifty proof-of-purchases.',
'We\'re not saying drink more, we\'re saying trade up."',
'FOR YEARS, costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle.',
'Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired.',
'And the merchandise was, well, fake.',
'The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland.',
'The two are also signing a trade agreement.',
'South Korean government officials said they don\'t expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can" offer experience."',
'Poland is the second Communist nation to recognize the Seoul government; South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary in February nineteen eighty nine.',
'Nissan\'s market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade.',
'Its US sales sagged, partly because of price increases due to the rising yen.',
'Worst of all, Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting, cronyism and corporate rigidity.',
'But Nissan expects to earn only one hundred twenty billion yen in the current fiscal year, a modest increase of four point seven percent.',
'The big reason: For all its cost-cutting, Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota.',
'In its last fiscal year, Nissan\'s profit represented just two point three percent of sales, compared with four point three percent at Toyota.',
'To help close the gap, Nissan recently established a top-level cost-cutting committee.',
'Perhaps the biggest challenge, however, will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues.',
'Already, personnel officials are talking about the need for a" Phase Two" cultural-reform effort of some sort.',
'"We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company, and there are many more things to do," President Kume says.',
'He adds, however, that" the momentum we have generated is unstoppable."',
'Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations, the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders.',
'Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home.',
'American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the US could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics, whose support he needs.',
'Instead, this official said," This is vintage George Bush.',
'This was George Bush\'s own idea.',
'It\'s George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly."',
'Where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece, rather than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime, it is difficult to justify.',
'Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass, minor property destruction, blocking traffic and the like.',
'They say these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause.',
'The crimes may appear small, but the prices can be huge.',
'Here are two cases to illustrate.',
'Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car.',
'The protesters lie down in the street, blocking traffic, and will not move until the authorities carry them away.',
'Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack.',
'There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital.',
'He dies.',
'The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor, but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal.',
'Long-debated proposals to simplify the more than one hundred fifty civil penalties and make them fairer and easier to administer are in the House tax bill.',
'But they were stripped from the Senate bill after staffers estimated penalty revenue would fall by two hundred sixteen million dollars over five years.',
'Still, congressional aides say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment, even if not this time around, although some provisions may be modified.',
'IRA balances could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by Reps. Chandler (R., Washington).',
'The bill would thwart a recent Labor Department opinion that investing individual-retirement-account funds to earn free checking violates the law.',
'That may leave a lot of leeway for US Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what, if anything, the pilots actually collect.',
'In August, he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator.',
'The pilots\' contract with Eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances.',
'Eastern and its creditors are in the final, delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline\'s debts.',
'An earlier plan, which had received the creditors\' approval in July, fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan.',
'It isn\'t known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan.',
'Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern, some Machinists union supervisors received a twenty percent pay raise.',
'The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them.',
'Eastern has disputed the claim, but a federal district court, an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots.',
'Now, after beating them, Mr. Achenbaum is joining them.',
'Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum, sixty two, vice chairman of professional services, reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer.',
'He joins November thirteen, dissolving his consulting firm, Canter, Achenbaum Associates.',
'Ad agencies typically earned a straight fifteen percent commission; if a client spent one hundred million dollars on TV time, the agency made fifteen million dollars.',
'But Mr. Achenbaum pioneered negotiated fees, which often worked out to less than fifteen percent.',
'More recently, he negotiated" indemnification" clauses in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account.',
'He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation, however, that clients didn\'t seek him out for anything else.',
'"I was very frustrated," he said.',
'"The fact of the matter is, I am a marketer.',
'That\'s another reason [for the Backer Spielvogel job].',
'It struck me as a way to get back to what I really want to do."',
'Mr. Spielvogel said Mr. Achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion, merchandising, publicity and other marketing outlets, and to integrate those services.',
'He will concentrate on, among others, JP Morgan and Hyundai.',
'Mr. Achenbaum helped Morgan in its recent agency search, and he has a long relationship with Hyundai, which is having severe troubles, including declining sales.',
'"The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising, and going towards other services," Mr. Spielvogel said.',
'Instead of being just an ad agency, he said:" We have redefined our mission here.',
'Our mission is to help our clients grow, and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that."',
'Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group, which he founded in nineteen seventy seven and which created ads for the black market.',
'Clients include Miller Brewing Company and General Motors.',
'Mr. Mingo was hospitalized September twenty three and died Monday, according to Samuel J. Chisholm, the agency\'s president and chief operating officer.',
'On military alternatives if the US pulls back:" The Soviets already are present.',
'I suppose sooner or later, the Japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side.',
'Maybe the Chinese, maybe even the Indians."',
'"What is the way forward?',
'To get the Khmer Rouge as part of a process for elections.',
'And when they lose, then we can expect China to stop aid.',
'Let\'s put it bluntly.',
'The Chinese cannot be seen to have made use of the Khmer Rouge and then discard them."',
'Doctor Levy\'s answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe, a device that he and dozens of US researchers are studying with great hope.',
'Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery, the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis.',
'Perhaps most exciting, the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain.',
'The field took off in nineteen eighty five after scientists at Britain\'s Sheffield University developed a handy, compact magnet for brain stimulation.',
'Since then, at least two commercial versions have been put on the US market, and an estimated five hundred have been sold.',
'In August, a Chicago conference on such devices attracted more than one hundred researchers, who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy.',
'The latest research pact bolsters Du Pont\'s growing portfolio of investments in superconductors.',
'The Wilmington, Delaware, chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and with Argonne National Laboratory.',
'Last year, Du Pont agreed to pay four point five million dollars for rights to superconductor work at the University of Houston.',
'But Japanese investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about Mexico\'s economic outlook, but also reservations about Mexico\'s recently revamped investment law.',
'Unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc, Mexico jury-rigged the existing law\'s regulations.',
'It created special twenty-year trusts to allow foreigners one hundred percent ownership in some once-closed industries.',
'It also made artful use of semantics, redefining as non-strategic industries some that had been in the national domain.',
'Indeed, in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point.',
'Several other European central banks, notably in Britain, followed the West German Bundesbank\'s lead by raising their own key rates.',
'And a week later, Japan raised its official discount rate by a half point to three point seven five percent.',
'The Japanese discount rate is the central bank\'s base rate on loans to commercial banks.',
'Started three years ago, Chemical\'s interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field.',
'From nineteen eighty seven to nineteen eighty eight, the value of Chemical\'s option contracts outstanding mushroomed to thirty seven billion dollars from seventeen billion dollars.',
'More importantly, the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost two-to one.',
'With such a lopsided book of options, traders say, Chemical was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions.',
'Five years of rapid expansion under American Brands, with an emphasis on marketing the agency\'s services instead of improving them, had hurt Pinkerton\'s profits, Mr. Wathen claims.',
'He says his team couldn\'t tell whether accounts receivable had been paid or not.',
'Pinkerton\'s had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business, with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired, he adds.',
'And regional offices were" egregiously overstaffed," he claims.',
'One office had nineteen people doing the work of three," and half of the employees had company automobiles."',
'You\'d think all the stories about well-heeled communities and developers getting HUD grants would prompt Congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies.',
'No way.',
'Congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit-ridden Federal Housing Administration.',
'It appears that the only thing Congress is learning from the HUD story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests.',
'But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have in mind for housing.',
'The Senate Banking Committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs.',
'Other Senators want to lower the down payments required on FHA-insured loans.',
'Of course, self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in.',
'Proponents of expanding FHA programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets.',
'But the FHA program is hemorrhaging bad loans.',
'Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms, and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage-grinder.',
'Like the S&L mess before it, this is a problem Congress should be solving, not ignoring.',
'At eleven point one percent of gross national product, US health costs already are the highest in the world.',
'By contrast, Japan\'s equal six point seven percent of GNP, a nation\'s total output of goods and services.',
'Management and labor worry that the gap makes US companies less competitive.'
