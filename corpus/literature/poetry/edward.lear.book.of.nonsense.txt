BOOK OF NONSENSE

By Edward Lear



         There was an Old Derry down Derry,
         Who loved to see little folks merry;
         So he made them a Book,
         And with laughter they shook,
         At the fun of that Derry down Derry!

               Who said, "It is just as I feared!--
               Two Owls and a Hen,
               Four Larks and a Wren,
               Have all built their nests in my beard!"




2.

               There was a Young Lady of Ryde,
               Whose shoe-strings were seldom untied;

               And some small spotty dogs,
               And frequently walked about Ryde.




3.

               There was an Old Man with a nose,
               Who said, "If you choose to suppose,
               That my nose is too long,
               You are certainly wrong!"
               That remarkable Man with a nose.




4.

               There was an Old Man on a hill,
               Who seldom, if ever, stood still;
               He ran up and down,
               In his Grandmother's gown,
               Which adorned that Old Man on a hill.




5.

               There was a Young Lady whose bonnet,
               Came untied when the birds sate upon it;
               But she said, "I don't care!
               All the birds in the air
               Are welcome to sit on my bonnet!"

7.

               There was an Old Person of Chili,

8.

               There was an Old Man with a gong,

               But they called out, "O law!
               You're a horrid old bore!"

10.
