One cannot always live in the palaces and state apartments of language,
but we can refuse to spend our days in searching for its vilest slums.
--William Watson

Words without thought are dead sounds; thoughts without words are nothing.
To think is to speak low; to speak is to think aloud.
--Max Muller

The first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer, or the talk
of a brilliant conversationalist, is the apt choice and contrast of the
words employed. It is indeed a strange art to take these blocks rudely
conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar, and by tact of
application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions.
--Robert Louis Stevenson

It is with words as with sunbeams, the more they are condensed, the deeper
they burn.
--Southey

No noble or right style was ever yet founded but out of a sincere heart.
--Ruskin

Words are things; and a small drop of ink, falling like dew upon a
thought, produces that which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think.
--Byron

A good phrase may outweigh a poor library.
--Thomas W. Higginson

INTRODUCTION

The most powerful and the most perfect expression of thought and feeling
through the medium of oral language must be traced to the mastery of
words. Nothing is better suited to lead speakers and readers of English
into an easy control of this language than the command of the phrase that
perfectly expresses the thought. Every speaker's aim is to be heard and
understood. A clear, crisp articulation holds an audience as by the spell
of some irresistible power. The choice word, the correct phrase, are
instruments that may reach the heart, and awake the soul if they fall upon
the ear in melodious cadence; but if the utterance be harsh and discordant
they fail to interest, fall upon deaf ears, and are as barren as seed sown
on fallow ground. In language, nothing conduces so emphatically to the
harmony of sounds as perfect phrasing--that is, the emphasizing of the
relation of clause to clause, and of sentence to sentence by the
systematic grouping of words. The phrase consists usually of a few words
which denote a single idea that forms a separate part of a sentence. In
this respect it differs from the clause, which is a short sentence that
forms a distinct part of a composition, paragraph, or discourse. Correct
phrasing is regulated by rests, such rests as do not break the continuity
of a thought or the progress of the sense.

GRENVILLE KLEISER, who has devoted years of his diligent life to imparting
the art of correct expression in speech and writing, has provided many
aids for those who would know not merely what to say, but how to say it.
He has taught also what the great HOLMES taught, that language is a temple
in which the human soul is enshrined, and that it grows out of life--out
of its joys and its sorrows, its burdens and its necessities. To him, as
well as to the writer, the deep strong voice of man and the low sweet
voice of woman are never heard at finer advantage than in the earnest but
mellow tones of familiar speech. In the present volume Mr. Kleiser
furnishes an additional and an exceptional aid for those who would have a
mint of phrases at their command from which to draw when in need of the
golden mean for expressing thought. Few indeed are the books fitted to-day
for the purpose of imparting this knowledge, yet two centuries ago
phrase-books were esteemed as supplements to the dictionaries, and have
not by any manner of means lost their value. The guide to familiar
quotations, the index to similes, the grammars, the readers, the
machine-made letter-writer of mechanically perfect letters of
congratulation or condolence--none are sententious enough to supply the
need. By the compilation of this praxis, Mr. Kleiser has not only supplied
it, but has furnished a means for the increase of one's vocabulary by
practical methods. There are thousands of persons who may profit by the
systematic study of such a book as this if they will familiarize
themselves with the author's purpose by a careful reading of the
preliminary pages of his book. To speak in public pleasingly and readily
and to read well are accomplishments acquired only after many days, weeks
even, of practise.

Foreigners sometimes reproach us for the asperity and discordance of our
speech, and in general, this reproach is just, for there are many persons
who do scanty justice to the vowel-elements of our language. Although
these elements constitute its music they are continually mistreated. We
flirt with and pirouette around them constantly. If it were not so,
English would be found full of beauty and harmony of sound. Familiar with
the maxim, "Take care of the vowels and the consonants will take care of
themselves,"--a maxim that when put into practise has frequently led to
the breaking-down of vowel values--the writer feels that the common custom
of allowing "the consonants to take care of themselves" is pernicious. It
leads to suppression or to imperfect utterance, and thus produces
indistinct articulation.

The English language is so complex in character that it can scarcely be
learned by rule, and can best be mastered by the study of such idioms and
phrases as are provided in this book; but just as care must be taken to
place every accent or stress on the proper syllable in the pronouncing of
every word it contains, so must the stress or emphasis be placed on the
proper word in every sentence spoken. To read or speak pleasingly one
should resort to constant practise by doing so aloud in private, or
preferably, in the presence of such persons as know good reading when they
hear it and are masters of the melody of sounds. It was Dean Swift's
belief that the common fluency of speech in many men and most women was
due to scarcity of matter and scarcity of words. He claimed that a master
of language possessed a mind full of ideas, and that before speaking, such
a mind paused to select the choice word--the phrase best suited to the
occasion. "Common speakers," he said, "have only one set of ideas, and one
set of words to clothe them in," and these are always ready on the lips.
Because he holds the Dean's view sound to-day, the writer will venture to
warn the readers of this book against a habit that, growing far too common
among us, should be checked, and this is the iteration and reiteration in
conversation of "the battered, stale, and trite" phrases, the like of
which were credited by the worthy Dean to the women   of his time.

Human thought elaborates itself with the progress of intelligence. Speech
is the harvest of thought, and the relation which exists between words and
the mouths that speak them must be carefully observed. Just as nothing is
more beautiful than a word fitly spoken, so nothing is rarer than the use
of a word in its exact meaning. There is a tendency to overwork both words
and phrases that is not restricted to any particular class. The learned
sin in this respect even as do the ignorant, and the practise spreads
until it becomes an epidemic. The epidemic word with us yesterday was
unquestionably "conscription"; several months ago it was "preparedness."
Before then "efficiency" was heard on every side and succeeded in
superseding "vocational teaching," only to be displaced in turn by "life
extension" activities. "Safety-first" had a long run which was brought
almost to abrupt end by "strict accountability," but these are mere
reflections of our cosmopolitan life and activities. There are others that
stand out as indicators of brain-weariness. These are most frequently met
in the work of our novelists.

English authors and journalists are abusing and overworking the word
intrigue to-day. Sir Arthur Quillercouch on page 81 of his book "On the
Art of Writing" uses it: "We are intrigued by the process of manufacture
instead of being wearied by a description of the ready-made article." Mrs.
Sidgwick in "Salt and Savour," page 232, wrote: "But what intrigued her
was Little Mamma's remark at breakfast," From the Parliamentary news, one
learns that "Mr. Harcourt intrigued the House of Commons by his sustained
silence for two years" and that "London is interested in, and not a little
intrigued, by the statement." This use of intrigue in the sense of
"perplex, puzzle, trick, or deceive" dates from 1600. Then it fell into a
state of somnolence, and after an existence of innocuous desuetude lasting
till 1794 it was revived, only to hibernate again until 1894. It owes its
new lease of life to a writer on The Westminster Gazette, a London journal
famous for its competitions in aid of the restoring of the dead meanings
of words.

One is almost exasperated by the repeated use and abuse of the word
"intimate" in a recently published work of fiction, by an author who
aspires to the first rank in his profession. He writes of "the intimate
dimness of the room;" "a fierce intimate whispering;" "a look that was
intimate;" "the noise of the city was intimate," etc. Who has not heard,
"The idea!" "What's the idea?" "Is that the idea?" "Yes, that's the idea,"
with increased inflection at each repetition. And who is without a friend
who at some time or another has not sprung "meticulous" upon him? Another
example is afforded by the endemic use of "of sorts" which struck London
while the writer was in that city a few years ago. Whence it came no one
knew, but it was heard on every side. "She was a woman of sorts;" "he is a
Tory of sorts;" "he had a religion of sorts;" "he was a critic of sorts."
While it originally meant "of different or various kinds," as hats of
sorts; offices of sorts; cheeses of sorts, etc., it is now used
disparagingly, and implies something of a kind that is not satisfactory,
or of a character that is rather poor. This, as Shakespeare might have
said, is "Sodden business! There's a stewed phrase indeed!" [Footnote:
Troilus and Cressida, act iii, sc. 1.]

The abuse of phrases and the misuse of words rife among us can be checked
by diligent exercises in good English, such as this book provides. These
exercises, in conjunction with others to be found in different volumes by
the same author, will serve to correct careless diction and slovenly
speech, and lead to the art of speaking and writing correctly; for, after
all, accuracy in the use of words is more a matter of habit than of
theory, and once it is acquired it becomes just as easy to speak or to
write good English as bad English. It was Chesterfield's resolution not to
speak a word in conversation which was not the fittest he could recall.
All persons should avoid using words whose meanings they do not know, and
with the correct application of which they are unfamiliar. The best spoken
and the best written English is that which conforms to the language as
used by men and women of culture--a high standard, it is true, but one not
so high that it is unattainable by any earnest student of the English
tongue.
FRANK H. VIZETELLY.



HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

The study of words, phrases, and literary expressions is a highly
interesting pursuit. There is a reciprocal influence between thought and
language. What we think molds the words we use, and the words we use react
upon our thoughts. Hence a study of words is a study of ideas, and a
stimulant to deep and original thinking.

We should not, however, study "sparkling words and sonorous phrases" with
the object of introducing them consciously into our speech. To do so would
inevitably lead to stiltedness and superficiality. Words and phrases
should be studied as symbols of ideas, and as we become thoroughly
familiar with them they will play an unconscious but effective part in our
daily expression.

We acquire our vocabulary largely from our reading and our personal
associates. The words we use are an unmistakable indication of our thought
habits, tastes, ideals, and interests in life. In like manner, the
habitual language of a people is a barometer of their intellectual, civil,
moral, and spiritual ideals. A great and noble people express themselves
in great and noble words.

Ruskin earnestly counsels us to form the habit of looking intensely at
words. We should scrutinize them closely and endeavor to grasp their
innermost meaning. There is an indefinable satisfaction in knowing how to
choose and use words with accuracy and precision. As Fox once said, "I am
never at a loss for a word, but Pitt always has the word."

All the great writers and orators have been diligent students of words.
Demosthenes and Cicero were indefatigable in their study of language.
Shakespeare, "infinite in faculty," took infinite pains to embody his
thought in words of crystal clearness. Coleridge once said of him that
one might as well try to dislodge a brick from a building with one's
forefinger as to omit a single word from one of his finest passages.

Milton, master of majestic prose, under whose touch words became as living
things; Flaubert, who believed there was one and one only best word with
which to express a given thought; De Quincey, who exercised a weird-like
power over words; Ruskin, whose rhythmic prose enchanted the ear; Keats,
who brooded over phrases like a lover; Newman, of pure and melodious
style; Stevenson, forever in quest of the scrupulously precise word;
Tennyson, graceful and exquisite as the limpid stream; Emerson, of
trenchant and epigrammatic style; Webster, whose virile words sometimes
weighed a pound; and Lincoln, of simple, Saxon speech,--all these
illustrious men were assiduous in their study of words.

Many persons of good education unconsciously circumscribe themselves
within a small vocabulary. They have a knowledge of hundreds of desirable
words which they do not put into practical use in their speech or writing.
Many, too, are conscious of a poverty of language, which engenders in them
a sense of timidity and self-depreciation. The method used for building a
large vocabulary has usually been confined to the study of single words.
This has produced good results, but it is believed that eminently better
results can be obtained from a careful study of words and expressions, as
furnished in this book, where words can be examined in their context.

It is intended and suggested that this study should be pursued in
connection with, and as a supplement to, a good standard dictionary.
Fifteen minutes a day devoted to this subject, in the manner outlined,
will do more to improve and enlarge the vocabulary than an hour spent in
desultory reading.

There is no better way in which to develop the mental qualities of
clearness, accuracy, and precision, and to improve and enlarge the
intellectual powers generally, than by regular and painstaking study of
judiciously selected phrases and literary expressions.

PLAN OF STUDY

First examine the book in a general way to grasp its character, scope, and
purpose. Carefully note the following plan of classification of the
various kinds of phrases, and choose for initial study a section which you
think will be of the most immediate value to you.

I.    USEFUL PHRASES
II.   SIGNIFICANT PHRASES
III.  FELICITOUS PHRASES
IV.   IMPRESSIVE PHRASES
V.    PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
VI.   BUSINESS PHRASES
VII.  LITERARY EXPRESSIONS
VIII. STRIKING SIMILES
IX.   CONVERSATIONAL PHRASES
X.    PUBLIC SPEAKING PHRASES
XI.   MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES

There are many advantages in keeping before you a definite purpose in your
study of this book. A well-defined plan will act as an incentive to
regular and systematic effort, and incidentally develop your power of
concentration.

It is desirable that you set apart a certain convenient time each day for
this study. Regularity tends to produce maximum results. As you progress
with this work your interest will be quickened and you will realize the
desirability of giving more and more time to this important subject.

When you have chosen a section of the book which particularly appeals to
you, begin your actual study by reading the phrases aloud. Read them
slowly and understandingly. This tends to impress them more deeply upon
your mind, and is in itself one of the best and most practical ways of
acquiring a large and varied vocabulary. Moreover, the practise of
fitting words to the mouth rapidly develops fluency and facility of
speech.

Few persons realize the great value of reading aloud. Many of the foremost
English stylists devoted a certain period regularly to this practise.
Cardinal Newman read aloud each day a chapter from Cicero as a means of
developing his ear for sentence-rhythm. Rufus Choate, in order to
increase his command of language, and to avoid sinking into mere empty
fluency, read aloud daily, during a large part of his life, a page or more
from some great English author. As a writer has said, "The practise of
storing the mind with choice passages from the best prose writers and
poets, and thus flavoring it with the essence of good literatures, is one
which is commended both by the best teachers and by the example of some of
the most celebrated orators, who have adopted it with signal success."

This study should be pursued with pencil in hand, so that you may readily
underscore phrases which make a special appeal to you. The free use of a
pencil in marking significant parts of a book is good evidence of
thoroughness. This, too, will facilitate your work of subsequent review.

The habit of regularly copying, in your own handwriting, one or more pages
of phrases will be of immense practical value. This exercise is a great
aid in developing a facile English style. The daily use of the pen has
been recommended in all times as a valuable means of developing oral and
literary expression.

A helpful exercise is to pronounce a phrase aloud and then fit it into a
complete sentence of your own making. This practice gives added facility
and resourcefulness in the use of words.

As an enthusiastic student of good English, you should carefully note
striking and significant phrases or literary expressions which you find in
your general reading. These should be set down in a note-book reserved for
this exclusive purpose. In this way you can prepare many lists of your
own, and thus greatly augment the value of this study.

The taste for beauty, truth, and harmony in language can be developed by
careful study of well-selected phrases and literary expressions as
furnished in this book. A good literary style is formed principally by
daily study of great English writers, by careful examination of words in
their context, and by a discriminating use of language at all times.

A veritable spring-cleaning of the soul

A very practised and somewhat fastidious critic

A violent and mendacious tongue

A vivid and arresting presentation

A waking dream overshadowed her

A weird world of morbid horrors

A well-bred mixture of boldness and courtesy

A wild vivacity was in her face and manner

A wile of the devil's

A wind strayed through the gardens

A withering sensation of ineffable boredom

A wordless farewell

Absolutely vulgarized by too perpetual a parroting

Absorbed in a stream of thoughts and reminiscences

Absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night

Accidents which perpetually deflect our vagrant attention

Across the gulf of years

Administering a little deft though veiled castigation

Affected an ironic incredulity

Affecting a tone of gayety

After a first moment of reluctance

After an eternity of resolutions, doubts, and indecisions

Aghast at his own helplessness

Agitated and enthralled by day-dreams

Agitated with violent and contending emotions

Alien paths and irrelevant junketings

All embrowned and mossed with age

All her gift of serene immobility brought into play

All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds

All the lesser lights paled into insignificance

All the magic of youth and joy of life was there

All the place is peopled with sweet airs

All the sky was mother-of-pearl and tender

All the unknown of the night and of the universe was pressing upon him

All the world was flooded with a soft golden light

All was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions

All was incomprehensible

All was instinctive and spontaneous

Aloof from the motley throng

Ambition shivered into fragments

Amid distress and humiliation

Amid the direful calamities of the time

An acute note of distress in her voice

An agreeably grave vacuity

An air half quizzical and half deferential

An air of affected civility

An air of being meticulously explicit

An air of inimitable, scrutinizing, superb impertinence

An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all

An air of uncanny familiarity

An air which was distinctly critical

An almost pathetic appearance of ephemeral fragility

An almost riotous prodigality of energy

An answering glow of gratitude

An antagonist worth her steel

An artful stroke of policy

An assumption of hostile intent

An assurance of good-nature that forestalled hostility

An atmosphere of extraordinary languor

An atmosphere thick with flattery and toadyism

An attack of peculiar virulence and malevolence

An audacious challenge of ridicule

An avidity that bespoke at once the restlessness, and the genius of her mind

An awe crept over me

An eager and thirsty ear

An easy prey to the powers of folly

An effusive air of welcome

An equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism

An erect, martial, majestic, and imposing personage

An eternity of silence oppressed him

An expression of mildly humorous surprise

An expression of rare and inexplicable personal energy

An exquisite perception of things beautiful and rare

An iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart

An ignoring eye

An impenetrable screen of foliage

An impersonal and slightly ironic interest

An impervious beckoning motion

An inarticulate echo of his longing

An increased gentleness of aspect

An incursion of the loud, the vulgar and meretricious

An inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate

An inexpressible fervor of serenity

An ingratiating, awkward and, wistful grace

An inspired ray was in his eyes

An instant she stared unbelievingly

An intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth

An intense travail of mind

An obscure thrill of alarm

An odd little air of penitent self-depreciation

An open wit and recklessness of bearing

An oppressive sense of strange sweet odor

An optimistic after-dinner mood

An overburdening sense of the inexpressible

An uncomfortable premonition of fear

An unfailing sweetness and unerring perception

An unpleasant and heavy sensation sat at his heart

An unredeemed dreariness of thought

An unsuspected moral obtuseness

An utter depression of soul

And day peers forth with her blank eyes

And what is all this pother about?

Animated by noble pride

Anticipation painted the world in rose

Appalled in speechless disgust

Appealing to the urgent temper of youth

Apprehensive solicitude about the future

Ardent words of admiration

Armed all over with subtle antagonisms

Artless and unquestioning devotion

As if smitten by a sudden spasm

As the long train sweeps away into the golden distance

August and imperial names in the kingdom of thought

Awaiting his summons to the eternal silence


B

Bandied about from mouth to mouth

Barricade the road to truth

Bartering the higher aspirations of life

Beaming with pleasurable anticipation

Before was the open malignant sea

Beguiled the weary soul of man

Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night

Bent on the lofty ends of her destiny

Beset by agreeable hallucinations

Beset with smiling hills

Beside himself in an ecstasy of pleasure

Betokening an impulsive character

Beyond the farthest edge of night

Birds were fluting in the tulip-trees

Biting sentences flew about

Black inky night

Blithe with the bliss of the morning

Blown about by every wind of doctrine

Bookish precision and professional peculiarity

Borne from lip to lip

Borne onward by slow-footed time

Borne with a faculty of willing compromise

Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise

Broke in a stupendous roar upon the shuddering air

Browsing at will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought

Buffeted by all the winds of passion

Buried hopes rose from their sepulchers

Buried in the quicksands of ignorance

But none the less peremptorily

By a curious irony of fate

By a happy turn of thinking

By virtue of his impassioned curiosity


C

Carried the holiday in his eye

Chafed at the restraints imposed on him

Cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and feeling

Childlike contour of the body

Cleansed of prejudice and self-interest

Cloaked in prim pretense

Clothed with the witchery of fiction

Clutch at the very heart of the usurping mediocrity

Cold gaze of curiosity

Collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression

Comment of rare and delightful flavor

Conjuring up scenes of incredible beauty and terror

Conscious of unchallenged supremacy

Constant indulgence of wily stratagem and ambitious craft

Contemptuously indifferent to the tyranny of public opinion

Covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance

Crisp sparkle of the sea

Crystallize about a common nucleus

Cultivated with a commensurate zeal

Current play of light gossip

Curtains of opaque rain


D

Dallying in maudlin regret over the past

Dark with unutterable sorrows

Darkness oozed out from between the trees

Dawn had broken

Day stood distinct in the sky

Days of vague and fantastic melancholy

Days that are brief and shadowed

Deep shame and rankling remorse

Deficient in affectionate or tender impulses

Delicately emerging stars

Delicious throng of sensations

Despite her pretty insolence

Dignity and sweet patience were in her look

Dim opalescence of the moon

Dimly foreshadowed on the horizon

Dimmed by the cold touch of unjust suspicion

Disfigured by passages of solemn and pompous monotony.

Disguised itself as chill critical impartiality

Dismal march of death

Distinguished by hereditary rank or social position

Distract and beguile the soul

Distressing in their fatuous ugliness

Diverted into alien channels

Diverting her eyes, she pondered

Dogs the footsteps

Doled out in miserly measure

Doubt tortured him

Doubts beset her lonely and daring soul

Down the steep of disenchantment

Dreams and visions were surpassed

Dreams that fade and die in the dim west

Drear twilight of realities

Drift along the stream of fancy

Drowned in the deep reticence of the sea

Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him

Dull black eyes under their precipice of brows


E

Earth danced under a heat haze

Easily moved to gaiety and pleasure

Either way her fate was cruel

Embrace with ardor the prospect of serene leisure

Endearing sweetness and manner

Endeavoring to smile away his chagrin

Endlessly shifting moods

Endowed with all those faculties that can make the world a garden of enchantment

Endowed with life and emphasis

Enduring with smiling composure the near presence of people who are distasteful

Enjoyed with astonishing unscrupulousness

Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon

Essay a flight of folly

Evanescent shades of feeling

Events took an unexpected sinister turn

Every curve of her features seemed to express a fine arrogant acrimony and harsh truculence

Everywhere the fragrance of a bountiful earth

Exasperated by what seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance

Exhibits itself in fastidious crotchets

Expectation darkened into anxiety

Experience and instinct warred within her

Exquisite graciousness of manner

Exquisitely stung by the thought


F

Familiar and endearing intimacy

Fatally and indissolubly united

Fathomless depths of suffering

Fear held him in a vice

Feeding his scholarly curiosity

Feeling humiliated by the avowal

Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words

Fettered by poverty and toil

Feverish tide of life

Fine precision of intent

Fitful tumults of noble passion

Fleeting touches of something alien and intrusive

Floating in the clouds of reverie

Fluctuations of prosperity and adversity

Flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole countenance

Forebodings possessed her

Foreshadowing summer's end

Forever echo in the heart

Forever sings itself in memory

Formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric

Fragments of most touching melody

Free from rigid or traditional fetters

Freedom and integrity of soul

Freighted with strange, vague longings

Frosty thraldom of winter

Fugitive felicities of thought and sensation

Full of dreams and refinements and intense abstractions

Full of majestic tenderness


G

Gathering all her scattered impulses into a passionate act of courage

Gaze dimly through a maze of traditions

Generosity pushed to prudence

Gleams of sunlight, bewildered like ourselves, struggled, surprised, through the mist and disappeared

Glowing with haste and happiness

Go straight, as if by magic, to the inner meaning

Goaded on by his sense of strange importance

Graceful length of limb and fall of shoulders

Great shuddering seized on her

Green hills pile themselves upon each other's shoulders

Grim and sullen after the flush of the morning

Guilty of girlish sentimentality


H

Half choked by a rising paroxysm of rage

Half-suffocated by his triumph

Hardened into convictions and resolves

Haughtiness and arrogance were largely attributed to him

Haunt the recesses of the memory

Haunted with a chill and unearthly foreboding

He accosted me with trepidation

He adroitly shifted his ground

He airily lampooned their most cherished prejudices

He bowed submission

He braced himself to the exquisite burden of life

He condescended to intimate speech with her

He conversed with a colorless fluency

He could detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness

He could do absolutely naught

He drank of the spirit of the universe

He drew near to a desperate resolve

He evinced his displeasure by a contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl

He felt an unaccountable loathing

He felt the ironic rebound of her words

He flung diffidence to the winds

He flushed crimson

He found the silence intolerably irksome

He frowned perplexedly

He gave her a baffled stare

He gave himself to a sudden day-dream

He gave his ear to this demon of false glory

He grew wanton with success

He had acted with chivalrous delicacy of honor

He had the eye of an eagle in his trade

He had the gift of deep, dark silences

He held his breath in admiring silence

He laughed away my protestations

He lent no countenance to the insensate prattle

He listened greedily and gazed intent

He made a loathsome object

He made the politest of monosyllabic replies

He murmured a civil rejoinder

He murmured a vague acceptance

He mused a little while in grave thought

He never wears an argument to tatters

He only smiled with fatuous superiority

He paused, stunned and comprehending

He perceived the iron hand within the velvet glove

He raised a silencing hand

He ruled autocratically

He sacrificed the vulgar prizes of life

He sat on thorns

He set his imagination adrift

He shambled away with speed

He sighed deeply, from a kind of mental depletion

He smote her quickening sensibilities

He submitted in brooding silence

He suppressed every sign of surprise

He surrendered himself to gloomy thought

He threaded a labyrinth of obscure streets

He threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his muscles

He threw out phrases of ill-humor

He threw round a measuring eye

He treads the primrose path of dalliance

He used an unguarded adjective

He was a tall, dark, saturnine youth, sparing of speech

He was aware of emotion

He was born to a lively and intelligent patriotism

He was dimly mistrustful of it

He was discreetly silent

He was empty of thought

He was entangled in a paradox

He was giving his youth away by handfuls

He was haunted and begirt by presences

He was measured and urbane

He was most profoundly skeptical

He was nothing if not grandiloquent

He was quaking on the precipice of a bad bilious attack

He was utterly detached from life

He went hot and cold

He would fall into the blackest melancholies

He writhed in the grip of a definite apprehension

He writhed with impotent humiliation

Her blank gaze chilled you

Her bright eyes were triumphant

Her eyes danced with malice

Her eyes dilated with pain and fear

Her eyes were full of wondering interest

Her eyes were limpid and her beauty was softened by an air of indolence and languor

Her face stiffened anew into a gray obstinacy

Her face was lit up by a glow of inspiration and resolve

Her haughty step waxed timorous and vigilant

Her head throbbed dangerously

Her heart appeared to abdicate its duties

Her heart fluttered with a vague terror

Her heart pounded in her throat

Her heart was full of speechless sorrow

Her hurrying thoughts clamored for utterance

Her imagination recoiled

Her interest flagged

Her life had dwarfed her ambitions

Her limbs ran to marble

Her lips hardened

Her lips parted in a keen expectancy

Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote

Her mind was beaten to the ground by the catastrophe

Her mood was unaccountably chilled

Her musings took a sudden and arbitrary twist

Her scarlet lip curled cruelly

Her smile was faintly depreciatory

Her smile was linked with a sigh

Her solicitude thrilled him

Her stare dissolved

Her step seemed to pity the grass it prest

Her strength was scattered in fits of agitation

Her stumbling ignorance which sought the road of wisdom

Her thoughts outstripped her erring feet

Her tone was gathering remonstrance

Her tongue on the subject was sharpness itself

Her tongue stumbled and was silent

Her voice had the coaxing inflections of a child

Her voice trailed off vaguely

Her voice was full of temper, hard-held

Her voice, with a tentative question in it, rested in air

Her wariness seemed put to rout

His accents breathed profound relief

His agitation increased

His brow grew knit and gloomy

His brow was in his hand

His conscience leapt to the light

His constraint was excruciating

His curiosity is quenched

His dignity counseled him to be silent

His ears sang with the vibrating intensity of his secret existence

His eyes had a twinkle of reminiscent pleasantry

His eyes literally blazed with savage fire

His eyes shone with the pure fire of a great purpose

His eyes stared unseeingly

His face caught the full strength of the rising wind

His face dismissed its shadow

His face fell abruptly into stern lines

His face lit with a fire of decision

His face showed a pleased bewilderment

His face torn with conflict

His face was gravely authoritative

His gaze faltered and fell

His gaze searched her face

His gaze seemed full of unconquerable hopefulness

His hand supported his chin

His hands were small and prehensible

His heart asserted itself again, thunderously beating

His heart rebuked him

His heart was full of enterprise

His impatient scorn expired

His last illusions crumbled

His lips loosened in a furtively exultant smile

His lips seemed to be permanently parted in a good-humored smile

His mind echoed with words

His mind leaped gladly to meet new issues and fresh tides of thought

His mind was dazed and wandering in a mist of memories

His mood yielded

His mouth quivered with pleasure

His passions vented themselves with sneers

His pulses leaped anew

His reputation had withered

His sensibilities were offended

His shrewd gaze fixed appraisingly upon her

His soul full of fire and eagle-winged

His soul was compressed into a single agony of prayer

His soul was wrung with a sudden wild homesickness

His speech faltered

His swift and caustic satire

His temper was dark and explosive

His thoughts galloped

His thoughts were in clamoring confusion

His tone assumed a certain asperity

His torpid ideas awoke again

His troubled spirit shifted its load

His vagrant thoughts were in full career

His voice insensibly grew inquisitorial

His voice was thick with resentment and futile protest

His whole face was lighted with a fierce enthusiasm

His whole frame seemed collapsed and shrinking

His whole tone was flippant and bumptious

His words trailed off brokenly

His youthful zeal was contagious

Hope was far and dim

How sweet and reasonable the pale shadows of those who smile from some dim corner of our memories

Humiliating paltriness of revenge


I

I capitulated by inadvertence

I cut my reflections adrift

I felt a qualm of apprehension

I suffered agonies of shyness

I took the good day from the hands of God as a perfect gift

I was in a somber mood

I was overshadowed by a deep boding

I was piqued

I yielded to the ingratiating mood of the day

Ill-bred insolence was his only weapon

Ill-dissimulated fits of ambition

Imbued with a vernal freshness

Immense and careless prodigality

Immense objects which dwarf us

Immersed in secret schemes

Immured in a trivial round of duty

Impassioned and earnest language

Impatient and authoritative tones

Impervious to the lessons of experience

Implying an immense melancholy

Imprisoned within an enchanted circle

In a deprecating tone of apology

In a flash of revelation

In a gale of teasing merriment

In a misery of annoyance and mortification

In a musing ecstasy of contemplation

In a sky stained with purple, the moon slowly rose

In a spirit of indulgent irony

In a strain of exaggerated gallantry

In a tone of after-dinner perfunctoriness

In a tone of musing surprise

In a tumult of self-approval and towering exultation

In a vague and fragmentary way

In a wise, superior, slightly scornful manner

In accents of menace and wrath

In its whole unwieldy compass

In moments of swift and momentous decision

In quest of something to amuse

In requital for various acts of rudeness

In the air was the tang of spring

In the dusky path of a dream

In the face of smarting disillusions

In the flush and heyday of youth and gaiety and loveliness

In the heyday of friendship

In the mild and mellow maturity of age

In the perpetual presence of everlasting verities

In this breathless chase of pleasure

In this chastened mood I left him

Incapable of initiative or boldness

Inconceivable perversion of reasoning

Indolently handsome eyes

Indulge in pleasing discursiveness

Ineffable sensation of irritability

Infantile insensibility to the solemnity of his bereavement

Infantine simplicity and lavish waste

Innumerable starlings clove the air

Insensible to its subtle influence

Inspired by the immortal flame of youth

Intangible and indescribable essence

Intense love of excitement and adventure

Intimations of unpenetrated mysteries

Into her eyes had come a hostile challenge

Into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently

Into the very vestibule of death

Involuntarily she sighed

Involuntary awkwardness and reserve

Involved in a labyrinth of perplexities

It came to him with a stab of enlightenment

It elicited a remarkably clear and coherent statement

It is a flight beyond the reach of human magnanimity

It is a thing infinitely subtle

It is not every wind that can blow you from your anchorage

It lends no dazzling tints to fancy

It moved me to a strange exhilaration

It parted to a liquid horizon and showed the gray rim of the sea

It proved a bitter disillusion

It seemed intolerably tragic

It seemed to exhale a silent and calm authority

It was a breathless night of suspense

It was a desolating vision

It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind

It was a night of stupefying surprises

It was all infinitely soft and refreshing to the eye

It was an evening of great silences and spaces, wholly tranquil

It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy

It was the ecstasy and festival of summer

It was torture of the most exquisite kind


J

Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling

Joy rioted in his large dark eyes

Judging without waiting to ponder over bulky tomes


K

Kind of unscrupulous contempt for gravity

Kiss-provoking lips


L

Laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle

Language of excessive flattery and adulation

Lapped in soft music of adulation

Lapse into pathos and absurdity

Large, dark, luminous eyes that behold everything about them

Latent vein of whimsical humor

Lead to the strangest aberrations

Leaping from lambent flame into eager and passionate fire

Leave to the imagination the endless vista of possibilities

Life flowed in its accustomed stream

Lights and shadows of reviving memory crossed her face

Lionized by fashionable society

Long intertangled lines of silver streamlets

Lost in a delirious wonder

Lost in irritable reflection

Love hovered in her gaze

Ludicrous attempts of clumsy playfulness and tawdry eloquence

Luke-warm assurance of continued love

Lulled by dreamy musings

Luminous with great thoughts


M

Magnanimous indifference to meticulous niceties

Making the ear greedy to remark offense

Marching down to posterity with divine honors

Marked out for some strange and preternatural doom

Mawkishly effeminate sentiment

Memories plucked from wood and field

Memory was busy at his heart

Merged in a sentiment of unutterable sadness and compassion

Microscopic minuteness of eye

Misgivings of grave kinds

Mockery crept into her tone

Molded by the austere hand of adversity

Moments of utter idleness and insipidity

Moods of malicious reaction and vindictive recoil

Morn, in yellow and white, came broadening out of the mountains

Mumble only jargon of dotage

My body is too frail for its moods


N

Nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts

New ambitions pressed upon his fancy

New dreams began to take wing in his imagination

Night after night the skies were wine-blue and bubbling with stars

Night passes lightly in the open world, with its stars and dews and perfumes

Nights of fathomless blackness

No mark of trick or artifice

Noble and sublime patience

Nursed by brooding thought


O

Obsessed with the modishness of the hour

Occasional flashes of tenderness and love

Oddly disappointing and fickle

One gracious fact emerges here

One long torture of soul

One of the golden twilights which transfigure the world

Oppressed and disheartened by an all-pervading desolation

Oppressed with a confused sense of cumbrous material

Outweighing years of sorrow and bitterness

Over and over the paroxysms of grief and longing submerged her

Overhung and overspread with ivy

Overshadowed by a vague depression


P

Pale and vague desolation

Pallor of reflected glories

Palpitating with rage and wounded sensibility

Panting after distinction

Peace brooded over all

Pelted with an interminable torrent of words

Penetrate beneath the surface to the core

Peopled the night with thoughts

Perpetual gloom and seclusion of life

Pertinent to the thread of the discussion

Pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content

Piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon

Platitudinous and pompously sentimental

Plaudits of the unlettered mob

Pleasant and flower-strewn vistas of airy fancy

Pledged with enthusiastic fervor

Plumbing the depth of my own fears

Poignant doubts and misgivings

Power of intellectual metamorphosis

Power to assuage the thirst of the soul

Precipitated into mysterious depths of nothingness

Preening its wings for a skyward flight

Pressing cares absorbed him

Pride working busily within her

Proclaimed with joyous defiance

Prodigal of discriminating epithets

Prodigious boldness and energy of intellect

Products of dreaming indolence

Profound and chilling solitude of the spot

Proof of his imperturbability and indifference

Provocative of bitter hostility

Pulling the strings of many enterprises

Purge the soul of nonsense


Q

Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth

Quivering with restrained grief


R

Radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth

Ransack the vocabulary

Red tape of officialdom

Redolent of the night lamp

Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars

Regarded with an exulting pride

Rehabilitated and restored to dignity

Remorselessly swept into oblivion

Resounding generalities and conventional rhetoric

Respect forbade downright contradiction

Restless and sore and haughty feelings were busy within

Retort leaped to his lips

Rigid adherence to conventionalities

Rudely disconcerting in her behavior

Rudely reminded of life's serious issues


S

Sacrificed to a futile sort of treadmill

Sadness prevailed among her moods

Scorched with the lightning of momentary indignation

Scorning such paltry devices

Scotched but not slain

Scrupulous morality of conduct

Seem to swim in a sort of blurred mist before the eyes

Seething with suppressed wrath

Seize on greedily

Sensuous enjoyment of the outward show of life

Serenity beamed from his look

Serenity of paralysis and death

Seriousness lurked in the depths of her eyes

Served to recruit his own jaded ideas

Set anew in some fresh and appealing form

Setting all the sane traditions at defiance

Shadowy vistas of sylvan beauty

She affected disdain

She assented in precisely the right terms

She bandies adjectives with the best

She challenged his dissent

She cherished no petty resentments

She curled her fastidious lip

She curled her lip with defiant scorn

She did her best to mask her agitation

She disarmed anger and softened asperity

She disclaimed fatigue

She fell into a dreamy silence

She fell into abstracted reverie

She felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent impressions

She flushed an agitated pink

She forced a faint quivering smile

She frowned incomprehension

She had an air of restrained fury

She had an undercurrent of acidity

She hugged the thought of her own unknown and unapplauded integrity

She lingered a few leisurely seconds

She nodded mutely

She nourished a dream of ambition

She permitted herself a delicate little smile

She poured out on him the full opulence of a proud recognition

She questioned inimically

She recaptured herself with difficulty

She regarded him stonily out of flint-blue eyes

She sat eyeing him with frosty calm

She seemed the embodiment of dauntless resolution

She seemed wrapped in a veil of lassitude

She shook hands grudgingly

She softened her frown to a quivering smile

She spoke with hurried eagerness

She spoke with sweet severity

She stilled and trampled on the inward protest

She stood her ground with the most perfect dignity

She strangled a fierce tide of feeling that welled up within her

She swept away all opposing opinion with the swift rush of her enthusiasm

She thrived on insincerity

She twitted him merrily

She was both weary and placated

She was conscious of a tumultuous rush of sensations

She was demure and dimly appealing

She was exquisitely simple

She was gripped with a sense of suffocation and panic

She was in an anguish of sharp and penetrating remorse

She was oppressed by a dead melancholy

She was stricken to the soul

She wore an air of wistful questioning

Sheer superfluity of happiness

Sickening contrasts and diabolic ironies of life

Silence fell

Singing lustily as if to exorcise the demon of gloom

Skirmishes and retreats of conscience

Slender experience of the facts of life

Slope towards extinction

Slow the movement was and tortuous

Slowly disengaging its significance from the thicket of words

So innocent in her exuberant happiness

Soar into a rosy zone of contemplation

Softened by the solicitude of untiring and anxious love

Solitary and sorely smitten souls

Some dim-remembered and dream-like images

Some exquisite refinement in the architecture of the brain

Some flash of witty irrelevance

Something curiously suggestive and engaging

Something eminently human beaconed from his eyes

Something full of urgent haste

Something indescribably reckless and desperate in such a picture

Something that seizes tyrannously upon the soul

Sore beset by the pressure of temptation

Specious show of impeccability

Spectacular display of wrath

Spur and whip the tired mind into action

Stale and facile platitudes

Stamped with unutterable and solemn woe

Startled into perilous activity

Startling leaps over vast gulfs of time

Stem the tide of opinion

Stern emptying of the soul

Stimulated to an ever deepening subtlety

Stirred into a true access of enthusiasm

Stony insensibility to the small pricks and frictions of daily life

Strange capacities and suggestions both of vehemence and pride

Strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets

Stripped to its bare skeleton

Strode forth imperiously

Struck by a sudden curiosity

Struck dumb with strange surprise

Stung by his thoughts, and impatient of rest

Stung by the splendor of the prospect

Subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty

Sublime indifference to contemporary usage and taste

Submission to an implied rebuke

Subtle indications of great mental agitation

Subtle suggestions of remoteness

Such things as the eye of history sees

Such was the petty chronicle

Suddenly a thought shook him

Suddenly overawed by a strange, delicious shyness

Suddenly smitten with unreality

Suddenly snuffed out in the middle of ambitious schemes

Suffered to languish in obscurity

Sugared remonstrances and cajoleries

Suggestions of veiled and vibrant feeling

Summer clouds floating feathery overhead

Sunk in a phraseological quagmire

Sunk into a gloomy reverie

Sunny silence broods over the realm of little cottages

Supreme arbiter of conduct

Susceptibility to fleeting impressions

Sweet smoke of burning twigs hovered in the autumn day

Swift summer into the autumn flowed


T

Taking the larger sweeps in the march of mind

Tears of outraged vanity blurred her vision

Teased with impertinent questions

Tenderness breathed from her

Tense with the anguish of spiritual struggle

Terror filled the more remote chambers of his brain with riot

Tethered to earth

That which flutters the brain for a moment

The accelerated beat of his thoughts

The affluent splendor of the summer day

The afternoon was filled with sound and sunshine

The afternoon was waning

The air and sky belonged to midsummer

The air darkened swiftly

The air is touched with a lazy fragrance, as of hidden flowers

The air was caressed with song

The air was full of fugitive strains of old songs

The air was raw and pointed

The allurements of a coquette

The ambition and rivalship of men

The angry blood burned in his face

The anguish of a spiritual conflict tore his heart

The artificial smile of languor

The awful and implacable approach of doom

The babble of brooks grown audible

The babbledom that dogs the heels of fame

The bait proved incredibly successful

The balm of solitary musing

The beauty straightway vanished

The beckonings of alien appeals

The benign look of a father

The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power

The blinding mist came down and hid the land

The blue bowl of the sky, all glorious with the blaze of a million worlds

The bound of the pulse of spring

The buzz of idolizing admiration

The caressing peace of bright soft sunshine

The chaotic sound of the sea

The chill of forlorn old age

The chill of night crept in from the street

The chivalric sentiment of honor

The chivalrous homage of respect

The clamorous agitation of rebellious passions

The clouded, restless, jaded mood

The constant iteration of the sea's wail

The contagion of extravagant luxury

The conversation became desultory

The crowning touch of pathos

The current of his ideas flowed full and strong

The dance whizzed on with cumulative fury

The dawn is singing at the door

The day sang itself into evening

The day was at once redolent and vociferous

The day was blind with fog

The day was gracious

The days passed in a stately procession

The days when you dared to dream

The debilitating fears of alluring fate

The deep and solemn purple of the summer night

The deep flush ebbed out of his face

The deep tranquillity of the shaded solitude

The deepening twilight filled with shadowy visions

The deepest wants and aspirations of his soul

The delicatest reproof of imagined distrust

The demerit of an unworthy alliance

The desire of the moth for the star

The dimness of the sealed eye and soul

The dreamy solicitations of indescribable afterthoughts

The dying day lies beautiful in the tender glow of the evening

The early morning of the Indian summer day was tinged with blue mistiness

The earth looked despoiled

The east alone frowned with clouds

The easy grace of an unpremeditated agreeable talker

The easy-going indolence of a sedentary life

The echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills

The empurpled hills standing up, solemn and sharp, out of the green-gold air

The enchanting days of youth

The eternal questioning of inscrutable fate

The evening comes with slow steps

The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night

The exaggerations of morbid hallucinations

The excitement of rival issues

The extraordinary wistful look of innocence and simplicity

The eye of a scrutinizing observer

The eyes burnt with an amazing fire

The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity

The father's vigil of questioning sorrow

The fine flower of culture

The first recoil from her disillusionment

The flawless triumph of art

The flight of the autumnal days

The flower of courtesy

The fluttering of untried wings

The foreground was incredibly shabby

The fragrance of a dear and honored name

The freshening breeze struck his brow with a cooling hand

The freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea

The fruit of vast and heroic labors

The general effect was of extraordinary lavish profusion

The give and take was delicious

The gloom of the afternoon deepened

The gloom of winter dwelt on everything

The gloomy insolence of self-conceit

The glow of the ambitious fire

The golden gloom of the past and the bright-hued hope of the future

The golden riot of the autumn leaves

The golden sunlight of a great summer day

The gray air rang and rippled with lark music

The grimaces and caperings of buffoonery

The grotesque nightmare of a haunting fear

The hand of time sweeps them into oblivion

The haunting melody of some familiar line of verse

The haunting phrase leaped to my brain

The headlong vigor of sheer improvisation

The heights of magnanimity and love

The high-bred pride of an oriental

The hills were clad in rose and amethyst

The hill-tops gleam in morning's spring

The hinted sweetness of the challenge aroused him

The hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her

The hungry curiosity of the mind

The idiosyncratic peculiarities of thought

The idle chatter of the crowd

The immediate tyranny of a present emotion

The inaccessible solitude of the sky

The incarnation of all loveliness

The incoherent loquacity of a nervous patient

The indefinable air of good-breeding

The indefinable yearning for days that were dead

The indefinite atmosphere of an opulent nature

The intercepted glances of wondering eyes

The intrusive question faded

The invidious stigma of selfishness

The iron hand of oppression

The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time

The irrevocable past and the uncertain future

The landscape ran, laughing, downhill to the sea

The leaden sky rests heavily on the earth

The leaves of time drop stealthily

The leaves syllabled her name in cautious whispers

The lights winked

The little incident seemed to throb with significance

The lofty grace of a prince

The loud and urgent pageantry of the day

The low hills on the horizon wore a haze of living blue

The machinations of a relentless mountebank

The machinations of an unscrupulous enemy

The magical lights of the horizon

The majestic solemnity of the moment yielded to the persuasive warmth of day

The marvelous beauty of her womanhood

The maximum of attainable and communicable truth

The melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair

The melodies of birds and bees

The memory of the night grew fantastic and remote

The meticulous observation of facts

The mind freezes at the thought

The mind was filled with a formless dread

The mocking echoes of long-departed youth

The moment marked an epoch

The moon is waning below the horizon

The more's the pity

The morning beckons

The morning droned along peacefully

The most servile acquiescence

The multiplicity of odors competing for your attention

The murmur of soft winds in the tree-tops

The murmur of the surf boomed in melancholy mockery

The murmuring of summer seas

The music and mystery of the sea

The music of her delicious voice

The music of her presence was singing a swift melody in his blood

The music of unforgotten years sounded again in his soul

The mute melancholy landscape

The mystery obsessed him

The naked fact of death

The nameless and inexpressible fascination of midnight music

The narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit

The nascent spirit of chivalry

The night was drowned in stars

The old ruddy conviction deserted me

The onrush and vividness of life

The opulent sunset

The orange pomp of the setting sun

The oscillations of human genius

The outpourings of a tenderness reawakened by remorse

The pageantry of sea and sky

The palest abstractions of thought

The palpitating silence lengthened

The panorama of life was unrolled before him

The paraphernalia of power and prosperity

The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun

The past slowly drifted out of his thought

The pendulous eyelids of old age

The penetrating odors assailed his memory as something unforgettable

The pent-up intolerance of years of repression

The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance

The piquancy of the pageant of life

The pith and sinew of mature manhood

The plenitude of her piquant ways

The presage of disaster was in the air

The pressure of accumulated misgivings

The preternatural pomposities of the pulpit

The pristine freshness of spring

The pull of soul on body

The pulse of the rebounding sea

The purging sunlight of clear poetry

The purple vaulted night

The question drummed in head and heart day and night

The question irresistibly emerged

The quick pulse of gain

The radiant serenity of the sky

The radiant stars brooded over the stainless fields, white with freshly fallen snow

The restlessness of offended vanity

The retreating splendor of autumn

The rising storm of words

The river ran darkly, mysteriously by

The river sang with its lips to the pebbles

The roar of the traffic rose to thunder

The romantic ardor of a generous mind

The room had caught a solemn and awful quietude

The rosy-hued sky went widening off into the distance

The rosy twilight of boyhood

The royal arrogance of youth

The sadness in him deepened inexplicably

The scars of rancor and remorse

The scent of roses stole in with every breath of air

The sea heaved silvery, far into the night

The sea slept under a haze of golden winter sun

The sea-sweep enfolds you, satisfying eye and mind

The sea-wind buffeted their faces

The secret and subduing charm of the woods

The see-saw of a wavering courage

The sentimental tourist will be tempted to tarry

The shadows of the night seemed to retreat

The shadows rested quietly under the breezeless sky

The shafts of ridicule

The sheer weight of unbearable loneliness

The shiver of the dusk passed fragrantly down the valley

The silence grew stolid

The silence was uncomfortable and ominous

The silent day perfumed with the hidden flowers

The silver silence of the night

The sinking sun made mellow gold of all the air

The sky grew brighter with the imminent day

The sky grew ensaffroned with the indescribable hue that heralds day

The sky put on the panoply of evening

The sky was a relentless, changeless blue

The sky was dull and brooding

The sky was heavily sprinkled with stars

The sky was turning to the pearly gray of dawn

The smiling incarnation of loveliness

The song of hurrying rivers

The sound of the sea waxed

The spacious leisure of the forest

The spell of a deathless dream was upon them

The star-strewn spaces of the night

The stars looked down in their silent splendor

The stars seemed attentive

The steadfast mind kept its hope

The steady thunder of the sea accented the silence

The still voice of the poet

The stillness of a forced composure

The stillness of the star-hung night

The strangest thought shimmered through her

The stream forgot to smile

The streams laughed to themselves

The strident discord seemed to mock his mood

The stunning crash of the ocean saluted her

The subtle emanation of other influences seemed to arrest and chill him

The sudden rush of the awakened mind

The summit of human attainment

The sun blazed torridly

The sun goes down in flame on the far horizon

The sun lay golden-soft over the huddled hills

The sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside

The sunset was rushing to its height through every possible phase of violence and splendor

The suspicion of secret malevolence

The swelling tide of memory

The swing of the pendulum through an arch of centuries

The tempered daylight of an olive garden

The tender grace of a day that is fled

The tension of struggling tears which strove for an outlet

The thought leaped

The timely effusion of tearful sentiment

The tone betrayed a curious irritation

The torture of his love and terror crushed him

The trees rustled and whispered to the streams

The tumult in her heart subsided

The tumult in her mind found sudden speech

The tumult of pride and pleasure

The tune of moving feet in the lamplit city

The tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts

The unmasked batteries of her glorious gray eyes

The vacant fields looked blankly irresponsive

The vast and shadowy stream of time

The vast cathedral of the world

The vast unexplored land of dreams

The velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker, and the stars more luminous

The veneer of a spurious civilization

The very pulsation and throbbing of his intellect

The very silence of the place appeared a source of peril

The vision fled him

The vivifying touch of humor

The web of lies is rent in pieces

The wheel of her thought turned in the same desolate groove

The whispering rumble of the ocean

The white seething surf fell exhausted along the shore

The whole exquisite night was his

The whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up with little momentary shiverings and shadows

The wide horizon forever flames with summer

The wild whirl of nameless regret and passionate sorrow

The wild winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay

The wind charged furiously through it, panting towards the downs

The wind piped drearily

The wind was in high frolic with the rain

The winnowed tastes of the ages

The woods were silent with adoration

The youth of the soul

The zenith turned shell pink

Their ephemeral but enchanting beauty had expired forever

Their eyes met glancingly

Their troth had been plighted

There was a kind of exhilaration in this subtle baiting

There was a mild triumph in her tone

There was a mournful and dim haze around the moon

There was a strange massing and curving of the clouds

There was a thrill in the air

There was a time I might have trod the sunlit heights

There was no glint of hope anywhere

There was no menace in the night's silvern calmness

There was something so kindly in its easy candor

There was spendthrift grandeur

These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm

They became increasingly turbid and phantasmagorical

They escaped the baffled eye

They sit heavy on the soul

They were vastly dissimilar

This exquisite conjunction and balance

This little independent thread of inquiry ran through the texture of his mind and died away

This shadowy and chilling sentiment unaccountably creeps over me

Thought shook through her in poignant pictures

Thoughts came thronging in panic haste

Thrilled by fresh and indescribable odors

Thrilled with a sense of strange adventure

Through a cycle of many ages

Through endless and labyrinthine sentences

Thrilled to the depths of her being

Time had passed unseen

Tinsel glitter of empty titles

Tired with a dull listless fatigue

To all intents and purposes

To speak with entire candor

To stay his tottering constancy

To the scourging he submitted with a good grace

Tossed disdainfully off from young and ardent lips

Touched every moment with shifting and enchanting beauty

Touched with a bewildering and elusive beauty

Transcendental contempt for money

Transformed with an overmastering passion

Trouble gathered on his brow

Turning the world topsy-turvey

Twilight creeps upon the darkening mind


U

Unapproachable grandeur and simplicity

Unaware of her bitter taunt

Under the vivifying touch of genius

Unearthly in its malignant glee

Unfathomed depths and impossibilities

Unforced and unstudied depth of feeling

Unspoiled by praise or blame

Unspoken messages from some vaster world

Unstable moral equilibrium of boyhood

Until sleep overtakes us at a stride

Untouched by the ruthless spirit of improvement

Upon the mountain-tops of meditation

Urbanely plastic and versatile

Uttering grandiose puerilities


V

Vain allurements of folly and fashion

Variously ramified and delicately minute channels of expression

Varnished over with a cold repellent cynicism

Vast sweep of mellow distances

Veiled by some equivocation

Vibrant with the surge of human passions

Vicissitudes of wind and weather

Vigor and richness of resource

Visible and palpable pains and penalties

Voices that charm the ear and echo with a subtle resonance in the soul

Volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions


W

Wantonly and detestably unkind

Waylay Destiny and bid him stand and deliver

Wayward and strangely playful responses

Wearing the white flower of a blameless life

What sorry and pitiful quibbling

When a pleasant countryside tunes the spirit to a serene harmony of mood

When music is allied to words

When the frame and the mind alike seem unstrung and listless

When the profane voices are hushed

When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze

Whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes

Whistled life away in perfect contentment

Wholly alien to his spirit

With a vanquished and weary sigh

Womanly fickleness and caprice

Words and acts easily wrenched from their true significance

Worn to shreds by anxiety

Wrapped in a sudden intensity of reflection

Wrapped in an inaccessible mood

Wrapped in scudding rain

Wrapt in his odorous and many-colored robe

Wrapt in inward contemplation

Wrought of an emotion infectious and splendidly dangerous

Wrought out of intense and tragic experience


Y

Yielding to a wave of pity

Your mind enthroned in the seventh circle of content



SECTION VIII

STRIKING SIMILES


A

A blind rage like a fire swept over him

A book that rends and tears like a broken saw

A breath of melancholy made itself felt like a chill and sudden gust from some unknown sea

A cloud in the west like a pall creeps upward

A cloud like a flag from the sky

A cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree

A confused mass of impressions, like an old rubbish-heap

A cry as of a sea-bird in the wind

A dead leaf might as reasonably demand to return to the tree

A drowsy murmur floats into the air like thistledown

A face as imperturbable as fate

A face as pale as wax

A face tempered like steel

A fatigued, faded, lusterless air, as of a caged creature

A few pens parched by long disuse

A figure like a carving on a spire

A fluttering as of blind bewildered moths

A giant galleon overhead, looked like some misty monster of the deep

A glacial pang of pain like the stab of a dagger of ice frozen from a poisoned well

A glance that flitted like a bird

A great moon like a red lamp in the sycamore

A grim face like a carved mask

A hand icily cold and clammy as death

A heart from which noble sentiments sprang like sparks from an anvil

A jeweler that glittered like his shop

A lady that lean'd on his arm like a queen in a fable of old fairy days

A life, a Presence, like the air

A life as common and brown and bare as the box of earth in the window there

A light wind outside the lattice swayed a branch of roses to and fro, shaking out their perfume as from a swung censer

A lightning-phrase, as if shot from the quiver of infallible wisdom

A list of our unread books torments some of us like a list of murders

A little breeze ran through the corn like a swift serpent

A little weed-clogged ship, gray as a ghost

A long slit of daylight like a pointing finger

A memory like a well-ordered cupboard

A mighty wind, like a leviathan, plowed the brine

A mind very like a bookcase

A mystery, soft, soothing and gentle, like the whisper of a child murmuring its happiness in its sleep

A name which sounds even now like the call of a trumpet

A note of despairing appeal which fell like a cold hand upon one's living soul

A purpose as the steady flame

A question deep almost as the mystery of life

A quibbling mouth that snapped at verbal errors like a lizard catching flies

A radiant look came over her face, like a sudden burst of sunshine on a cloudy day

A reputation that swelled like a sponge

A ruby like a drop of blood

A shadow of melancholy touched her lithe fancies, as a cloud dims the waving of golden grain

A silver moon, like a new-stamped coin, rode triumphant in the sky

A slow thought that crept like a cold worm through all his brain

A smile flashed over her face, like sunshine over a flower

A soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst

A soft haze, like a fairy dream, is floating over wood and stream

A soul as white as heaven

A sound like the throb of a bell

A stooping girl as pale as a pearl

A sudden sense of fear ran through her nerves like the chill of an icy wind

A sweet voice caroling like a gold-caged nightingale

A thin shrill voice like the cry of an expiring mouse

A thing of as frail enchantment as the gleam of stars upon snow

A vague thought, as elusive as the smell of a primrose

A vanishing loveliness as tender as the flush of the rose leaf and as ethereal as the light of a solitary star

A voice as low as the sea

A voice soft and sweet as a tune that one knows

A white bird floats there, like a drifting leaf

Against a sky as clear as sapphire

Age, like winter weather

Agile as a leopard

Agitated like a storm-tossed ship

Air like wine

All around them like a forest swept the deep and empurpled masses of her tangled hair

All like an icicle it seemed, so tapering and cold

All my life broke up, like some great river's ice at touch of spring

All silent as the sheeted dead

All sounds were lost in the whistle of air humming by like the flight of a million arrows

All that's beautiful drifts away like the waters

All the world lay stretched before him like the open palm of his hand

All unconscious as a flower

Alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year

An anxiety hung like a dark impenetrable cloud

An ardent face out-looking like a star

An ecstasy which suddenly overwhelms your mind like an unexpected and exquisite thought

An envious wind crept by like an unwelcome thought

An ideal as sublime and comprehensive as the horizon

An immortal spirit dwelt in that frail body, like a bird in an outworn cage

An impudent trick as hackneyed as conjuring rabbits out of a hat

An indefinable resemblance to a goat

An isle of Paradise, fair as a gem

An old nodding negress whose sable head shined in the sun like a polished cocoanut

An omnibus across the bridge crawls like a yellow butterfly

An undefined sadness seemed to have fallen about her like a cloud

An unknown world, wild as primeval chaos

An unpleasing strain, like the vibration of a rope drawn out too fast

And a pinnace like a flutter'd bird came flying from afar

And a tear like silver, glistened in the corner of her eye

And all our thoughts ran into tears like sunshine into rain

And at first the road comes moving toward me, like a bride waving palms

And Dusk, with breast as of a dove, brooded

And eyes as bright as the day

And fell as cold as a lump of clay

And her cheek was like a rose

And here were forests ancient as the hills

And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond, as clear as elemental diamond, or serene morning air

And melting like the stars in June

And night, as welcome as a friend

And silence like a poultice comes to heal the blows of sound

And spangled o'er with twinkling points, like stars

And the smile she softly uses fills the silence like a speech

As a child in play scatters the heaps of sand that he has piled on the seashore

As a cloud that gathers her robe like drifted snow

As a flower after a drought drinks in the steady plunging rain

As a leaf that beats on a mountain

As a lion grieves at the loss of her whelps

As a man plowing all day longs for supper and welcomes sunset

As a sea disturbed by opposing winds

As amusing as a litter of likely young pigs

As arbitrary as a cyclone and as killing as a pestilence

As austere as a Roman matron

As beautiful as the purple flush of dawn

As blind as a mole

As brief as sunset clouds in heaven

As bright as sunlight on a stream

As busy as a bee

As cattle driven by a gadfly

As chimney sweepers come to dust

As clear as a whistle

As clear as the parts of a tree in the morning sun

As close as oak and ivy stand

As delicate and as fair as a lily

As delightful to the mind as cool well-water to thirsty lip

As diamond cuts diamond

As direct and unvarying as the course of a homing bird

As distinct as night and morning

As dry as desert dust

As dumb as a fish

As easily as the sun shines

As easy as a turn of the hand

As elastic as a steel spring

As extinct as the dodo

As faint as the memory of a sound

As familiar to him as his alphabet

As fatal as the fang of the most venomous snake

As fleeting and elusive as our dreams

As foam from a ship's swiftness

As fresh and invigorating as a sea-breeze

As full of eager vigor as a mountain stream

As full of spirit as a gray squirrel

As gay and busy as a brook

As gently as the flower gives forth its perfume

As gently as withered leaves float from a tree

As graceful as a bough

As grave as a judge

As great as the first day of creation

As high as heaven

As I dropped like a bolt from the blue

As I dwelt like a sparrow among the spires

As if a door were suddenly left ajar into some world unseen before

As impossible as to count the stars in illimitable space

As in the footsteps of a god

As inaccessible to his feet as the clefts and gorges of the clouds

As inexorable as the flight of time

As innocent as a new laid egg

As iridescent as a soap bubble

As locusts gather to a stream before a fire

As mellow and deep as a psalm

As men strip for a race, so must an author strip for the race with time

As merry as bees in clover

As nimble as water

As one who has climbed above the earth's eternal snowline and sees only white peaks and pinnacles

As pale as any ghost

As patient as the trees

As quick as the movement of some wild animal

As quiet as a nun breathless with adoration

As radiant as the rose

As readily and naturally as ducklings take to water

As reticent as a well-bred stockbroker

As ruthlessly as the hoof of a horse tramples on a rose

As shallow streams run dimpling all the way

As simple as the intercourse of a child with its mother

As sleep falls upon the eyes of a child tired with a long summer day of eager pleasure and delight

As some vast river of unfailing source

As stars that shoot along the sky

As still as a stone

As stupid as a sheep

As sudden as a dislocated joint slipping back into place

As summer winds that creep from flower to flower

As supple as a step-ladder

As swaggering and sentimental as a penny novellete

As swift as thought

As the accumulation of snowflakes makes the avalanche

As the bubble is extinguished in the ocean

As the dew upon the roses warms and melts the morning light

As the fair cedar, fallen before the breeze, lies self-embalmed amidst the moldering trees

As the light straw flies in dark'ning whirlwinds

As the lightning cleaves the night

As the loud blast that tears the skies

As the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods

As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance

As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again

As though Pharaoh should set the Israelites to make a pin instead of a pyramid

As unapproachable as a star

As weird as the elfin lights

As well try to photograph the other side of the moon

At extreme tension, like a drawn bow

Away he rushed like a cyclone

Awkward as a cart-horse


B

Babbling like a child

Balmy in manner as a bland southern morning

Be like the granite of thy rock-ribbed land

Beauteous she looks as a water-lily

Beautiful as the dawn, dominant as the sun

Beauty maddens the soul like wine

Beheld great Babel, wrathful, beautiful, burn like a blood-red cloud upon the plain

Beneath a sky as fair as summer flowers

Bent like a wand of willow

Black as a foam-swept rock

Black his hair as the wintry night

Blithe as a bird

Bounded by the narrow fences of life

Bowed like a mountain

Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk

Breathed like a sea at rest

Bright as a diamond in the sun

Bright as a fallen fragment of the sky

Bright as the coming forth of the morning, in the cloud of an early shower

Bright as the sunbeams

Bright as the tear of an angel, glittered a lonely star

Brilliant and gay as a Greek

Brisk as a wasp in the sunshine

Brittle and bent like a bow

Bronze-green beetles tumbled over stones, and lay helpless on their backs with the air of an elderly clergyman knocked down by an omnibus

Brown as the sweet smelling loam

Brute terrors like the scurrying of rats in a deserted attic

Buried in his library like a mouse in a cheese

Burns like a living coal in the soul

But across it, like a mob's menace, fell the thunder

But thou art fled, like some frail exhalation

Butterflies like gems


C

Calm as the night

Calm like a flowing river

Calm like a mountain brooding o'er the sea

Calmly dropping care like a mantle from her shoulders

Cast thy voice abroad like thunder

Charm upon charm in her was packed, like rose-leaves in a costly vase

Chaste as the icicle

Cheeks as soft as July peaches

Chill breath of winter

Choked by the thorns and brambles of early adversity

Cities scattered over the world like ant-hills

Cities that rise and sink like bubbles

Clear and definite like the glance of a child or the voice of a girl

Clear as a forest pool

Clear as crystal

Clenched little hands like rumpled roses, dimpled and dear

Cloud-like that island hung afar

Clouds like the petals of a rose

Cloudy mirror of opinion

Cold and hard as steel

Cold as the white rose waking at daybreak

Cold, glittering monotony like frosting around a cake

Collapsed like a concertina

Colored like a fairy tale

Companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm whose thunder is its knell

Consecration that like a golden thread runs through the warp and woof of one's life

Constant as gliding waters

Contending like ants for little molehill realms

Continuous as the stars that shine

Cowslips, like chance-found gold

Creeds like robes are laid aside

Creeping like a snail, unwillingly to school

Cruel as death

Curious as a lynx

Cuts into the matter as with a pen of fire


D

Dainty as flowers

Dance like a wave of the sea

Dark and deep as night

Dark as pitch

Dark trees bending together as though whispering secrets

Dazzling white as snow in sunshine

Deafening and implacable as some elemental force

Dear as remembered kisses after death

Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes

Dearer than night to the thief

Debasing fancies gather like foul birds

Deep as the fathomless sea

Deep dark well of sorrow

Delicate as nymphs

Delicate as the flush on a rose or the sculptured line on a Grecian urn

Denominational lines like stone walls

Dependency had dropped from her like a cast-off cloak

Despondency clung to him like a garment that is wet

Destructive as the lightning flash

Die like flies

Dip and surge lightly to and fro, like the red harbor-buoy

Disappearing into distance like a hazy sea

Dissatisfaction had settled on his mind like a shadow

Dissolve like some unsubstantial vision faded

Do make a music like to rustling satin

Dogging them like their own shadow

Dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale like water bubbling from a silver jar?

Drop like a feather, softly to the ground

Drowned like rats

Dull as champagne


E

Each like a corpse within its grave

Each moment was an iridescent bubble fresh-blown from the lips of fancy

Eager-hearted as a boy

Eager with the headlong zest of a hunter for the game

Ears that seemed as deaf as dead man's ears

Easy as a poet's dream

Emotions flashed across her face like the sweep of sun-rent clouds over a quiet landscape

Eternal as the skies

Evanescent as bubbles

Every flake that fell from heaven was like an angel's kiss

Every lineament was clear as in the sculptor's thought

Everyone on the watch, like a falcon on its nest

Every phrase is like the flash of a scimitar

Exploded like a penny squib

Eyes as deeply dark as are the desert skies

Eyes as luminous and bright and brown as waters of a woodland river

Eyes half veiled by slumberous tears, like bluest water seen through mists of rain

Eyes like a very dark topaz

Eyes like deep wells of compassionate gloom

Eyes like limpid pools in shadow

Eyes like mountain water that o'erflowing on a rock


F

Faces pale with bliss, like evening stars

Fade away like a cloud in the horizon

Faint and distant as the light of a sun that has long set

Faintly, like a falling dew

Fair and fleet as a fawn

Fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky

Fallen like dead leaves on the highway

Falling away like a speck in space

Fanciful and extravagant as a caliph's dream

Fawning like dumb neglected lap-dogs

Felt her breath upon his cheek like a perfumed air

Fields of young grain and verdured pastures like crushed velvet

Fierce as a bear in defeat

Fierce as the flames

Fills life up like a cup with bubbling and sparkling liquor

Fit closely together as the close-set stones of a building

Fix'd like a beacon-tower above the waves of a tempest

Flame like a flag unfurled

Flap loose and slack like a drooping sail

Flashed with the brilliancy of a well-cut jewel

Fled like sweet dreams

Fleet as an arrow

Flitted like a sylph on wings

Flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love

Fluent as a rill, that wanders silver-footed down a hill

Fluid as thought

Fluttered like gilded butterflies in giddy mazes

Fragile as a spider's web

Free as the air, from zone to zone I flew

Free as the winds that caress

Fresh and unworn as the sea that breaks languidly beside them

Fresh as a jewel found but yesterday

Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail

Frightened like a child in the dark

Full-throated as the sea

Furious as eagles


G

Gazed like a star into the morning light

Glaring like noontide

Gleam like a diamond on a dancing girl

Glistening like threads of gold

Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid

Glittering like an aigrette of stars

Gone astray as a sheep that is lost

Gone like a glow on the cloud at the close of day

Gone like tenants that quit without warning

Gorgeous as the hues of heaven

Grazing through a circulating library as contentedly as cattle in a fresh meadow

Great scarlet poppies lay in drifts and heaps, like bodies fallen there in vain assault


H

Hair as harsh as tropical grass and gray as ashes

Hangs like a blue thread loosen'd from the sky

Hard, sharp, and glittering as a sword

Harnessed men, like beasts of burden, drew it to the river-side

Haunts you like the memory of some former happiness

He began to laugh with that sibilant laugh which resembles the hiss of a serpent

He bent upon the lightning page like some rapt poet o'er his rhyme

He bolted down the stairs like a hare

He clatters like a windmill

He danced like a man in a swarm of hornets

He fell as falls some forest lion, fighting well

He fell down on my threshold like a wounded stag

He had acted exactly like an automaton

He lay as straight as a mummy

He lay like a warrior taking his rest

He lived as modestly as a hermit

He looked fagged and sallow, like the day

He looked with the bland, expressionless stare of an overgrown baby

He played with grave questions as a cat plays with a mouse

He radiated vigor and abundance like a happy child

He sat down quaking like a jelly

He saw disaster like a ghostly figure following her

He snatched furiously at breath like a tiger snatching at meat

He spoke with a uniformity of emphasis that made his words stand out like the raised type for the blind

He swayed in the sudden grip of anger

He sweeps the field of battle like a monsoon

He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed

He turned on me like a thunder-cloud

He turned white as chalk

He wandered restlessly through the house, like a prowling animal

He was as splendidly serious as a reformer

He was as steady as a clock

He was as wax in those clever hands

He was bold as the hawk

He was so weak now, like a shrunk cedar white with the hoar-frost

Hearts unfold like flowers before thee

Heavy was my heart as stone

Heeled like an avalanche to leeward

Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept

Her banners like a thousand sunsets glow

Her beauty broke on him like some rare flower

Her beauty fervent as a fiery moon

Her breath is like a cloud

Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud

Her cheeks were wan and her eyes like coals

Her dusky cheek would burn like a poppy

Her expression changed with the rapidity of a kaleidoscope

Her eyes as bright as a blazing star

Her eyes as stars of twilight fair

Her eyes, glimmering star-like in her pale face

Her eyes were as a dove that sickeneth

Her face changed with each turn of their talk, like a wheat-field under a summer breeze

Her face collapsed as if it were a pricked balloon

Her face was as solemn as a mask

Her face was dull as lead

Her face was like a light

Her face was passionless, like those by sculptor graved for niches in a temple

Her hair dropped on her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on a clam

Her hair hung down like summer twilight

Her hair shone like a nimbus

Her hair was like a coronet

Her hands are white as the virgin rose that she wore on her wedding day

Her hands like moonlight brush the keys

Her head dropped into her hands like a storm-broken flower

Her heart has grown icy as a fountain in the fall

Her holy love that like a vestal flame had burned

Her impulse came and went like fireflies in the dusk

Her lashes like fans upon her cheek

Her laugh is like a rainbow-tinted spray

Her lips are like two budded roses

Her lips like a lovely song that ripples as it flows

Her lips like twilight water

Her little lips are tremulous as brook-water is

Her long black hair danced round her like a snake

Her mouth as sweet as a ripe fig

Her neck is like a stately tower

Her pale robe clinging to the grass seemed like a snake

Her pulses flutter'd like a dove

Her skin was as the bark of birches

Her sweetness halting like a tardy May

Her two white hands like swans on a frozen lake

Her voice cut like a knife

Her voice like mournful bells crying on the wind

Her voice was like the voice the stars had when they sang together

Her voice was rich and vibrant, like the middle notes of a 'cello

Her words sounding like wavelets on a summer shore

Herding his thoughts as a collie dog herds sheep

Here and there a solitary volume greeted him like a friend in a crowd of strange faces

Here in statue-like repose, an old wrinkled mountain rose

Hers was the loveliness of some tall white lily cut in marble, splendid but chill

His bashfulness melted like a spring frost

His brow bent like a cliff o'er his thoughts

His cheeks were furrowed and writhen like rain-washed crags

His eyes blazed like deep forests

His eyes glowed like blue coals

His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like moldy hay

His face burnt like a brand

His face was glad as dawn to me

His face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine

His fingers were knotted like a cord

His formal kiss fell chill as a flake of snow on the cheek

His fortune melted away like snow in a thaw

His glorious moments were strung like pearls upon a string

His indifference fell from him like a garment

His invectives and vituperations bite and flay like steel whips

His mind murmurs like a harp among the trees

His mind was like a lonely wild

His mind was like a summer sky

His nerves thrilled like throbbing violins

His retort was like a knife-cut across the sinews

His revenge descends perfect, sudden, like a curse from heaven

His spirits sank like a stone

His talk is like an incessant play of fireworks

His voice is as the thin faint song when the wind wearily sighs in the grass

His voice rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes

His voice was like the clap of thunder which interrupts the warbling birds among the leaves

His whole soul wavered and shook like a wind-swept leaf

His words gave a curious satisfaction, as when a coin, tested, rings true gold

Hopeful as the break of day

How like a saint she sleeps

How like a winter hath my absence been

How like the sky she bends over her child

Howling in the wilderness like beasts

Huge as a hippopotamus

Humming-birds like lake of purple fire

Hushed as the grave

Hushed like a breathless lyre


I

I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew

I have heard the Hiddon People like the hum of swarming bees

I have seen the ravens flying, like banners of old wars

I saw a face bloom like a flower

I saw a river of men marching like a tide

I saw his senses swim dizzy as clouds

I wander'd lonely as a cloud

I was as sensitive as a barometer

I was no more than a straw on the torrent of his will

I will face thy wrath though it bite as a sword

Ideas which spread with the speed of light

Idle hopes, like empty shadows

Impassive as a statue

Impatient as the wind

Impregnable as Gibraltar

Impressive as a warrant of arrest for high treason

Incredible little white teeth, like snow shut in a rose

Infrequent carriages sped like mechanical toys guided by manikins

In honor spotless as unfallen snow

In that head of his a flame burnt that was like an altar-fire

In yonder cottage shines a light, far-gleaming like a gem

Instantly she revived like flowers in water

Intangible as a dream

It came and faded like a wreath of mist at eve

It cuts like knives, this air so chill

It drops away like water from a smooth statue

It pealed through her brain like a muffled bell

It poured upon her like a trembling flood

It racked his ears like an explosion of steam-whistles

It ran as clear as a trout-brook

It seems as motionless and still as the zenith in the skies

It set his memories humming like a hive of bees

It staggered the eye, like the sight of water running up hill

It stung like a frozen lash

It was as futile as to oppose an earthquake with argument

It was as if a door had been opened into a furnace, so the eyes blazed

It would collapse as if by enchantment

Its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven


J

Jealousy, fierce as the fires


K

Kindle like an angel's wings the western skies in flame

Kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go hand in hand like a happy aged couple

Kingdoms melt away like snow


L

Laboring like a giant

Languid streams that cross softly, slowly, with a sound like smothered weeping

Laughter like a beautiful bubble from the rosebud of baby-hood

Laughter like the sudden outburst of the glad bird in the tree-top

Lazy merchantmen that crawled like flies over the blue enamel of the sea

Leapt like a hunted stag

Let his frolic fancy play, like a happy child

Let in confusion like a whirling flood

Let thy mouth murmur like the doves

Life had been arrested, as the horologist, with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the clock

Life stretched before him alluring and various as the open road

Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer

Light as a snowflake

Lights gleamed there like stars in a still sky

Like a ball of ice it glittered in a frozen sea of sky

Like a blade sent home to its scabbard

Like a blast from a horn

Like a blast from the suddenly opened door of a furnace

Like a blossom blown before a breeze, a white moon drifts before a shimmering sky

Like a bright window in a distant view

Like a caged lion shaking the bars of his prison

Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep

Like a cloud of fire

Like a cold wind his words went through their flesh

Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue

Like a damp-handed auctioneer

Like a deaf and dumb man wondering what it was all about

Like a dew-drop, ill-fitted to sustain unkindly shocks

Like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm

Like a distant star glimmering steadily in the darkness

Like a dream she vanished

Like a festooned girdle encircling the waist of a bride

Like a flower her red lips parted

Like a game in which the important part is to keep from laughing

Like a glow-worm golden

Like a golden-shielded army

Like a great express train, roaring, flashing, dashing head-long

Like a great fragment of the dawn it lay

Like a great ring of pure and endless light

Like a great tune to which the planets roll

Like a high and radiant ocean

Like a high-born maiden

Like a jewel every cottage casement showed

Like a joyless eye that finds no object worth its constancy

Like a knight worn out by conflict

Like a knot of daisies lay the hamlets on the hill

Like a lily in bloom

Like a living meteor

Like a locomotive-engine with unsound lungs

Like a long arrow through the dark the train is darting

Like a mirage, vague, dimly seen at first

Like a miser who spoils his coat with scanting a little cloth

Like a mist the music drifted from the silvery strings

Like a moral lighthouse in the midst of a dark and troubled sea

Like a murmur of the wind came a gentle sound of stillness

Like a noisy argument in a drawing-room

Like a pageant of the Golden Year, in rich memorial pomp the hours go by

Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished

Like a poet hidden

Like a river of molten amethyst

Like a rocket discharging a shower of golden stars

Like a rose embower'd in its own green leaves

Like a sea of upturned faces

Like a shadow never to be overtaken

Like a shadow on a fair sunlit landscape

Like a sheeted ghost

Like a ship tossed to and fro on the waves of life's sea

Like a slim bronze statue of Despair

Like a snow-flake lost in the ocean

Like a soul that wavers in the Valley of the Shadow

Like a stalled horse that breaks loose and goes at a gallop through the plain

Like a star, his love's pure face looked down

Like a star that dwelt apart

Like a star, unhasting, unresting

Like a stone thrown at random

Like a summer cloud, youth indeed has crept away

Like a summer-dried fountain

Like a swift eagle in the morning glare breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight

Like a thing at rest

Like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the faraway past

Like a tide of triumph through their veins, the red, rejoicing blood began to race

Like a triumphing fire the news was borne

Like a troop of boys let loose from school, the adventurers went by

Like a vaporous amethyst

Like a vision of the morning air

Like a voice from the unknown regions

Like a wandering star I fell through the deeps of desire

Like a watch-worn and weary sentinel

Like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed

Like a whirlwind they went past

Like a withered leaf the moon is blown across the bay

Like a world of sunshine

Like a yellow silken scarf the thick fog hangs

Like an alien ghost I stole away

Like an eagle clutching his prey, his arm swooped down

Like an eagle dallying with the wind

Like an engine of dread war, he set his shoulder to the mountain-side

Like an enraged tiger

Like an enthusiast leading about with him an indifferent tourist

Like an icy wave, a swift and tragic impression swept through him

Like an unbidden guest

Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun

Like an unseen star of birth

Like an unwelcome thought

Like apparitions seen and gone

Like attempting to number the waves on the snore of a limitless sea

Like bells that waste the moments with their loudness

Like blasts of trumpets blown in wars

Like bright Apollo

Like bright lamps, the fabled apples glow

Like building castles in the air

Like bursting waves from the ocean

Like cliffs which have been rent asunder

Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments

Like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant

Like crystals of snow

Like dead lovers who died true

Like Death, who rides upon a thought, and makes his way through temple, tower, and palace

Like dew upon a sleeping flower

Like dining with a ghost

Like drawing nectar in a sieve

Like earth's decaying leaves

Like echoes from a hidden lyre

Like echoes from an antenatal dream

Like fixed eyes, whence the dear light of sense and thought has fled

Like footsteps upon wool

Like fragrance from dead flowers

Like ghosts, from an enchanter fleeing

Like ghosts the sentries come and go

Like golden boats on a sunny sea

Like great black birds, the demons haunt the woods

Like green waves on the sea

Like having to taste a hundred exquisite dishes in a single meal

Like Heaven's free breath, which he who grasps can hold not

Like helpless birds in the warm nest

Like iridescent bubbles floating on a foul stream

Like kindred drops mingled into one

Like laying a burden on the back of a moth

Like lead his feet were

Like leaves in wintry weather

Like leviathans afloat

Like lighting a candle to the sun

Like making a mountain out of a mole-hill

Like mariners pulling the life-boat

Like mice that steal in and out as if they feared the light

Like mountain over mountain huddled

Like mountain streams we meet and part

Like music on the water

Like notes which die when born, but still haunt the echoes of the hill

Like oceans of liquid silver

Like one pale star against the dusk, a single diamond on her brow gleamed with imprisoned fire

Like one who halts with tired wings

Like one who talks of what he loves in dream

Like organ music came the deep reply

Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream

Like phantoms gathered by the sick imagination

Like planets in the sky

Like pouring oil on troubled waters

Like roses that in deserts bloom and die

Like rowing upstream against a strong downward current

Like scents from a twilight garden

Like separated souls

Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp

Like sheep from out the fold of the sky, stars leapt

Like ships that have gone down at sea

Like shy elves hiding from the traveler's eye

Like skeletons, the sycamores uplift their wasted hands

Like some grave night thought threading a dream

Like some new-gathered snowy hyacinth, so white and cold and delicate it was

Like some poor nigh-related guest, that may not rudely be dismist

Like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings, but can find no rest within a pure and gentle mind

Like some unshriven churchyard thing, the friar crawled

Like something fashioned in a dream

Like sounds of wind and flood

Like splendor-winged moths about a taper

Like stepping out on summer evenings from the glaring ball-room

upon the cool and still piazza

Like straws in a gust of wind

Like summer's beam and summer's stream

Like sunlight, in and out the leaves, the robins went

Like sweet thoughts in a dream

Like the awful shadow of some unseen power

Like the bellowing of bulls

Like the boar encircled by hunters and hounds

Like the bubbles on a river sparkling, bursting, borne away

Like the cold breath of the grave

Like the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar

Like the cry of an itinerant vendor in a quiet and picturesque town

Like the dance of some gay sunbeam

Like the dawn of the morn

Like the detestable and spidery araucaria

Like the dew on the mountain

Like the dim scent in violets

Like the drifting foam of a restless sea when the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze

Like the embodiment of a perfect rose, complete in form and fragrance

Like the faint cry of unassisted woe

Like the faint exquisite music of a dream

Like the fair flower dishevel'd in the wind

Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array he cheers the morn, and all the earth revealeth

Like the falling thud of the blade of a murderous ax

Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream

Like the fitting of an old glove to a hand

Like the foam on the river

Like the great thunder sounding

Like the jangling of all the strings of some musical instrument

Like the jewels that gleam in baby eyes

Like the kiss of maiden love the breeze is sweet and bland

Like the long wandering love, the weary heart may faint for rest

Like the moon in water seen by night

Like the music in the patter of small feet

Like the prodigal whom wealth softens into imbecility

Like the quivering image of a landscape in a flowing stream

Like the rainbow, thou didst fade

Like the rustling of grain moved by the west-wind

Like the sap that turns to nectar, in the velvet of the peach

Like the sea whose waves are set in motion by the winds

Like the sea-worm, that perforates the shell of the mussel, which straightway closes the wound with a pearl

Like the setting of a tropical sun

Like the shadow of a great hill that reaches far out over the plain

Like the shadows of the stars in the upheaved sea

Like the shudder of a doomed soul

Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees rustle their pale leaves listlessly

Like the soft light of an autumnal day

Like the Spring-time, fresh and green

Like the stern-lights of a ship at sea, illuminating only the path which has been passed over

Like the sudden impulse of a madman

Like the swell of Summer's ocean

Like the tattered effigy in a cornfield

Like the vase in which roses have once been distill'd

Like the visits of angels, short and far between

Like the whole sky when to the east the morning doth return

Like thistles of the wilderness, fit neither for food nor fuel

Like those great rivers, whose course everyone beholds, but their springs have been seen by but few

Like thoughts whose very sweetness yielded proof that they were born for immortality

Like to diamonds her white teeth shone between the parted lips

Like torrents from a mountain source, we rushed into each other's arms

Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind past

Like two doves with silvery wings, let our souls fly

Like two flaming stars were his eyes

Like vaporous shapes half seen

Like village curs that bark when their fellows do

Like wasted hours of youth

Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber

Like wine-stain to a flask the old distrust still clings

Like winged stars the fire-flies flash and glance

Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear

Lingering like an unloved guest

Lithe as a panther

Little white hands like pearls

Lofty as a queen

Loneliness struck him like a blow

Looked back with faithful eyes like a great mastiff to his master's face

Looking as sulky as the weather itself

Looking like a snarling beast baulked of its prey

Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed

Lost like the lightning in the sullen clod

Love as clean as starlight

Love brilliant as the morning

Love had like the canker-worm consumed her early prime

Love is a changing lord as the light on a turning sword

Love like a child around the world doth run

Love like a miser in the dark his joys would hide

Love shakes like a windy reed your heart

Love smiled like an unclouded sun

Love that sings and has wings as a bird

Lovely as starry water

Lovely the land unknown and like a river flowing


M

March on my soul nor like the laggard stay

Me on whose heart as a worm she trod

Meaningless as the syllables of an unknown tongue

Men moved hither and thither like insects in their crevices

Mentality as hard as bronze

Mentally round-shouldered and decrepit

Merge imperceptibly into one another like the hues of the prism

Meteors that dart like screaming birds

Milk-white pavements, clear and richly pale, like alabaster

More variegated than the skin of a serpent

Motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber

Motionless as a plumb line

Mountains like frozen wrinkles on a sea

Moving in the same dull round, like blind horses in a mill

Mute as an iceberg

My age is as a lusty Winter

My body broken as a turning wheel

My breath to Heaven like vapor goes

My head was like a great bronze bell with one thought for the clapper

My heart is as some famine-murdered land

My heart is like a full sponge and must weep a little

My heart like a bird doth hover

My heart will be as wind fainting in hot grass

My life floweth away like a river

My life was white as driven snow

My love for thee is like the sovereign moon that rules the sea

My love's like the steadfast sun

My lungs began to crow like chanticleer

My mind swayed idly like a water-lily in a lake

My muscles are as steel

My skin is as sallow as gold

My soul was as a lampless sea

My spirit seemed to beat the void, like the bird from out the ark

My thoughts came yapping and growling round me like a pack of curs

My thoughts ran leaping through the green ways of my mind like fawns at play


N

Night falls like fire

No longer shall slander's venomed spite crawl like a snake across his perfect name

Now every nerve in my body seemed like a strained harp-string ready to snap at a touch

Now like a wild nymph she veils her shadowy form

Now like a wild rose in the fields of heaven slipt forth the slender figure of the Dawn

Now memory and emotion surged in my soul like a tempest

Now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau, stripped of his gaudy hues


O

Obscured with wrath as is the sun with cloud

Odorous as all Arabia

Often enough life tosses like a fretful stream among rocky boulders

Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud

Old as the evening star

Old happy hours that have long folded their wings

Once again, like madness, the black shapes of doubt swing through his brain

One bleared star, faint glimmering like a bee

One bright drop is like the gem that decks a monarch's crown

One by one flitting like a mournful bird

One deep roar as of a cloven world

One winged cloud above like a spread dragon overhangs the west

Oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a thick summer haze

Or shedding radiance like the smiles of God

Our enemies were broken like a dam of river reeds

Our hearts bowed down like violets after rain

Our sail like a dew-lit blossom shone

Overhead the intense blue of the noonday sky burst like a jewel in the sun


P

Pale and grave as a sculptured nun

Pale as a drifting blossom

Passed like a phantom into the shadows

Passive and tractable as a child

Peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday

Peevish and impatient, like some ill-trained man who is sick

Perished utterly, like a blown-out flame

Philosophy evolved itself, like a vast spider's loom

Pillowed upon its alabaster arms like to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil

Polished as the bosom of a star

Poured his heart out like the rending sea in passionate wave on wave

Pouting like the snowy buds o' roses in July

Presently she hovered like a fluttering leaf or flake of snow

Pride and self-disgust served her like first-aid surgeons on the battlefield

Proud as the proudest of church dignitaries

Pure as a wild-flower

Pure as the azure above them

Pure as the naked heavens

Pure as the snowy leaves that fold over the flower's heart

Purple, crimson, and scarlet, like the curtains of God's tabernacle

Put on gravity like a robe


Q

Quaking and quivering like a short-haired puppy after a ducking

Questions and answers sounding like a continuous popping of corks

Quiet as a nun's face

Quietly as a cloud he stole

Quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water

Quivering like an eager race-horse to start


R

Rage, rage ye tears, that never more should creep like hounds about God's footstool

Ran like a young fawn

Rattle in the ear like a flourish of trumpets

Rays springing from the east like golden arrows

Red as the print of a kiss might be

Redolent with the homely scent of old-fashioned herbs and flowers

Reflected each in the other like stars in a lake

Refreshed like dusty grass after a shower

Refreshing as descending rains to sunburnt climes

Remote as the hidden star

Restless as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day

Revealed his doings like those of bees in a glass hive

Rich as the dawn

Ride like the wind through the night

Rivers that like silver threads ran through the green and gold of pasture lands

Roared like mountain torrents

Rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel

Round my chair the children run like little things of dancing gold

Ruddy as sunrise

Ruddy his face as the morning light

Ruffling out his cravat with a crackle of starch, like a turkey when it spreads its feathers

Running to and fro like frightened sheep

Rushing and hurrying about like a June-bug


S

Sanctuaries where the passions may, like wild falcons, cover their faces with their wings

Sayings that stir the blood like the sound of a trumpet

Scattered love as stars do light

Sea-gulls flying like flakes of the sea

Sentences level and straight like a hurled lance

Shadowy faces, known in dreams, pass as petals upon a stream

Shake like an aspen leaf

Shaken off like a nightmare

Shapeless as a sack of wool

Shattered like so much glass

She brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together

She could summon tears as one summons servants

She danced like a flower in the wind

She disclaimed the weariness that dragged upon her spirits like leaden weights

She exuded a faint and intoxicating perfume of womanliness, like a crushed herb

She felt like an unrepentant criminal

She fled like a spirit from the room

She flounders like a huge conger-eel in an ocean of dingy morality

She gave him a surprised look, like a child catching an older person in a foolish statement

She gave off antipathies as a liquid gives off vapor

She has great eyes like the doe

She heard him like one in a dream

She let the soft waves of her deep hair fall like flowers from Paradise

She looked like a tall golden candle

She looked like the picture of a young rapt saint, lost in heavenly musing

She moved like mirth incarnate

She nestles like a dove

She played with a hundred possibilities fitfully and discursively as a musician runs his fingers over a key-board

She played with grave cabinets as a cat plays with a mouse

She saw this planet like a star hung in the glistening depths of even

She seemed as happy as a wave that dances on the sea

She shall be sportive as the fawn

She stood silent a moment, dropping before him like a broken branch

She that passed had lips like pinks

She walked like a galley-slave

She walks in beauty like the night

She was as brilliant, and as hard too, as electric light

She was silent, standing before him like a little statuesque figure

Shining like the dewy star of dawn

Shivering pine-trees, like phantoms

Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk

Shrill as the loon's call

Shrivel like paper thrust into a flame

Shy as the squirrel

Sights seen as a traveling swallow might see them on the wing

Silence deep as death

Silence now is brooding like a gentle spirit o'er the still and pulseless world

Silence that seemed heavy and dark; like a passing cloud

Sinks clamorous like mill-waters at wild play

Sits like the maniac on his fancied throne

Skies as clear as babies' eyes

Sleek and thick and yellow as gold

Slender and thin as a slender wire

Slowly as a tortoise

Slowly as the finger of a clock, her shadow came

Slowly moved off and disappeared like shapes breathed on a mirror and melting away

Slowly, unnoted, like the creeping rust that spreads insidious, had estrangement come

Small as a grain of mustard seed

Smooth as a pond

Smooth as the pillar flashing in the sun

Snug as a bug in a rug

Soaring as swift as smoke from a volcano springs

So elusive that the memory of it afterwards was wont to come and go like a flash of light

So my spirit beat itself like a caged bird against its prison bars in vain

Soft as a zephyr

Soft as sleep the snow fell

Soft as Spring

Soft as the down of the turtle dove

Soft as the landscape of a dream

Soft as the south-wind

Soft in their color as gray pearls

Soft vibrations of verbal melody, like the sound of a golden bell rung far down under the humming waters

Some gleams of feeling pure and warm as sunshine on a sky of storm

Some like veiled ghosts hurrying past as though driven to their land of shadows by shuddering fear

Some minds are like an open fire--how direct and instant our communication with them

Something divine seemed to cling around her like some subtle vapor

Something resistant and inert, like the obstinate rolling over of a heavy sleeper after he has been called to get up

Something sharp and brilliant, like the glitter of a sword or a forked flash of lightning

Sorrowful eyes like those of wearied kine spent from the plowing

Spread like wildfire

Squirrel-in-the-cage kind of movement

Stamping like a plowman to shuffle off the snow

Stared about like calves in a pen

Steadfast as the soul of truth

Steals lingering like a river smooth

Still as death

Stood like a wave-beaten rock

Straight as a ray of light

Straight as an arrow

Streamed like a meteor through the troubled air

Streamed o'er his memory like a forest flame

Streaming tears, like pearl drops from a flint

Striking with the force of an engine of destruction

Strong as a bison

Style comes, if at all, like the bloom upon fruit, or the glow of health upon the cheek

Subtle as jealousy

Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, flushing his brow

Sudden sprays of rain, like volleys of sharp arrows, rattled gustily against the windows

Suddenly, like death, the truth flashed on them

Sunbeams flashing on the face of things like sudden smilings of divine delight

Sunday mornings which seem to put on, like a Sabbath garment, an atmosphere of divine quietude

Supple and sweet as a rose in bloom

Sway like blown moths against the rosewhite flame

Sweet as a summer night without a breath

Sweet as music she spoke

Sweet as the rain at noon

Sweet as the smile of a fairy

Swift as a swallow heading south

Swift as lightning

Swift as the panther in triumph

Swifter than the twinkling of an eye


T

Talking and thinking became to him like the open page of a monthly magazine

Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o'er his head

That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along

The anemone that weeps at day-break, like a silly girl before her lover

The army blazed and glowed in the golden sunlight like a mosaic of a hundred thousand jewels

The army like a witch's caldron seethed

The beating of her heart was like a drum

The beauty of her quiet life was like a rose in blowing

The billows burst like cannon down the coast

The birds swam the flood of air like tiny ships

The boat cuts its swift way through little waves like molten gold and opal

The boom of the surf grew ever less sonorous, like the thunder of a retreating storm

The breast-plate of righteousness

The breathless hours like phantoms stole away

The breeze is as a pleasant tune

The calm white brow as calm as earliest morn

The camp fire reddens like angry skies

The chambers of the house were haunted by an incessant echoing, like some dripping cavern

The church swarmed like a hive

The city is all in a turmoil; it boils like a pot of lentils

The clouds that move like spirits o'er the welkin clear

The clustered apples burnt like flame

The colored bulbs swung noon-like from tree and shrub

The crimson close of day

The curl'd moon was like a little feather

The curling wreaths like turbans seem

The dark hours are swept away like crumbling ashes

The dark mass of her hair shook round her like a sea

The dawn is rising from the sea, like a white lady from her bed

The dawn had whitened in the mist like a dead face

The dawn with silver-sandaled feet crept like a frightened girl.

The day stunned me like light upon some wizard way

The day was sweeter than honey and the honey-comb

The day have trampled me like armed men

The dead past flew away over the fens like a flight of wild swans

The deep like one black maelstrom round her whirls

The deepening east like a scarlet poppy burnt

The desolate rocky hills rolled like a solid wave along the horizon

The dome of heaven is like one drop of dew

The dreams of poets come like music heard at evening from the depth of some enchanted forest

The eagerness faded from his eyes, leaving them cold as a winter sky after sunset

The earth was like a frying-pan, or some such hissing matter

The eternal sea, which like a childless mother, still must croon her ancient sorrows to the cold white moon

The evening sky was as green as jade

The excitement had spread through the whole house, like a piquant and agreeable odor

The excitement of the thought buoyed his high-strung temperament like a tonic

The feathery meadows like a lilac sea

The firm body like a slope of snow

The first whiff of reality dissipated them like smoke

The floor, newly waxed, gleamed in the candle-light like beaten moonbeams

The fragrant clouds of hair, they flowed round him like a snare

The gathering glory of life shone like the dawn

The gesture was all strength and will, like the stretching of a sea-bird's wings

The girl's voice rang like a bird-call through his rustling fancies

The glimmer of tall flowers standing like pensive moon-worshipers in an ecstasy of prayerless bloom

The guides sniffed, like chamois, the air

The heavens are like a scroll unfurled

The hills across the valley were purple as thunder-clouds

The hoofs of the horses rang like the dumb cadence of an old saga

The hours crawled by like years

The hum of the camp sounds like the sea

The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds

The ideas succeeded each other like a dynasty of kings

The impalpable presence of the new century rose like a vast empty house through which

no human feet had walked

The inexorable facts closed in on him like prison-warders hand-cuffing a convict

The lake glimmered as still as a mirror

The land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell

The land was like a dream

The level boughs, like bars of iron across the setting sun

The light of London flaring like a dreary dawn

The lights blazed up like day

The lilies were drooping, white, and wan, like the head and skin of a dying man

The mellowing hand of time

The melody rose tenderly and lingeringly like a haunting perfume of pressed flowers

The Milky Way lay like diamond-dust upon the robe of some great king

The monk's face whitened like sea-foam

The moon drowsed between the trees like a great yellow moth

The moon on the tower slept soft as snow

The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud

The moonlight lay like snow

The moonlight, like a fairy mist, upon the mesa spreads

The mortal coldness of the soul, like death itself comes down

The mountain shadows mingling, lay like pools above the earth

The mountains loomed up dimly, like phantoms through the mist

The music almost died away, then it burst like a pent-up flood

The name that cuts into my soul like a knife

The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile

The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet

The night like a battle-broken host is driven before

The night yawned like a foul wind

The ocean swelled like an undulating mirror of the bowl of heaven

The old books look somewhat pathetically from the shelves, like aged dogs wondering why no one takes them for a walk

The old infamy will pop into daylight like a toad out of fissure in the rock

The penalty falls like a thunderbolt from heaven

The phrase was like a spear-thrust

The pine trees waved as waves a woman's hair

The place was like some enchanted town of palaces

The plains to northward change their color like the shimmering necks of doves

The poppy burned like a crimson ember

The prime of man has waxed like cedars

The public press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds like a shipload of monkeys in a storm

The purple heather rolls like dumb thunder

The rainbows flashed like fire

The river shouted as ever its cry of joy over the vitality of life, like a spirited boy before the face of inscrutable nature

The roofs with their gables like hoods

The roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk

The satire of the word cut like a knife

The scullion with face shining like his pans

The sea reeled round like a wine-vat splashing

The sea-song of the trampling waves is as muffled bells

The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor

The sea, that gleamed still, like a myriad-petaled rose

The sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected

The setting of the sun is like a word of peace

The sharp hail rattles against the panes and melts on my cheeks like tears

The ships, like sheeted phantoms coming and going

The silence seemed to crush to earth like a great looking-glass and shiver into a million pieces

The silvery morning like a tranquil vision fills the world

The sky burned like a heated opal

The sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of blue enamel

The sky was as a shield that caught the stain of blood and battle from the dying sun

The sky was clear and blue, and the air as soft as milk

The sky was like a peach

The sky where stars like lilies white and fair shine through the mists

The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean

The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea

The soul is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life

The sound is like a noon-day gale

The sound is like a silver-fountain that springeth in a golden basin

The sound of a thousand tears, like softly pattering wings

The sound of your running feet that like the sea-hoofs beat

The spear-tongued lightning slipped like a snake

The Spring breaks like a bird

The stacks of corn in brown array, like tattered wigwams on the plain

The stars come down and trembling glow like blossoms on the waves below

The stars lay on the lapis-lazuli sky like white flower-petals on still deep water

The stars pale and silent as a seer

The strange cold sense of aloofness that had numbed her senses suddenly gave way like snow melting in the spring

The sudden thought of your face is like a wound when it comes unsought

The sun, like a great dragon, writhes in gold

The sun on the sea-wave lies white as the moon

The surf was like the advancing lines of an unknown enemy flinging itself upon the shore

The terrible past lay afar, like a dream left behind in the night

The tide was in the salt-weed, and like a knife it tore

The time, gliding like a dream

The torrent from the hills leaped down their rocky stairways like wild steeds

The tree whose plumed boughs are soft as wings of birds

The uproar and contention pierced him like arrows

The veiled future bowed before me like a vision of promise

The velvet grass that is like padding to earth's meager ribs

The villa dips its foot in the lake, smiling at its reflection like a bather lingering on the brink

The voice of Fate, crying like some old Bellman through the world

The voice that rang in the night like a bugle call

The warm kindling blood burned her cheeks like the breath of a hot wind

The waves were rolling in, long and lazy, like sea-worn travelers

The whole truth, naked, cold, and fatal as a patriot's blade

The wind all round their ears hissed like a flight of white-winged geese

The wind comes and it draws its length along like the genii from the earthen pot

The wine flows like blood

The woman seemed like a thing of stone

The words kept ringing in my ears like the tolling of a bell

The words of the wise fall like the tolling of sweet, grave bells upon the soul

The world had vanished like a phantasmagoria

The world is bitter as a tear

The world is in a simmer, like a sea

The world wavers within its circle like a dream

The years stretched before her like some vast blank page out to receive the record of her toil

The years vanished like a May snowdrift

The yellow apples glowed like fire

Their glances met like crossed swords

Their joy like sunshine deep and broad falls on my heart

Their minds rested upon the thought, as chasing butterflies might rest together on a flower

Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss

Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting

Then fall unheeded like the faded flower

Then felt I like some watcher of the skies

Then it swelled out to rich and glorious harmonies like a full orchestra playing under the sea

Then the lover sighing like furnace

Theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms

There is an air about you like the air that folds a star

There, like a bird, it sits and sings

There seemed to brood in the air a quiet benevolence of a Father watching His myriad children at play

There she soars like a seraph

There she stood straight as a lily on its stem

There slowly rose to sight, a country like a dragon fast asleep

There streamed into the air the sweet smell of crushed grass, as though many fields had been pressed between giant's fingers and so had been left

These eyes like stars have led me

These final words snapped like a whip-lash

These thoughts pierced me like thorns

They are as cruel as creeping tigers

They are as white foam on the swept sands

They are as white swans in the dusk, thy white hands

They are painted sharp as death

They broke into pieces and fell on the ground, like a silvery, shimmering shower of hail

They dropped like panthers

They fly like spray

They had hands like claws

They had slipped away like visions

They have as many principles as a fish has bones

They have faces like flowers

They hurried down like plovers that have heard the call

They look like rose-buds filled with snow

They seem like swarming flies, the crowd of little men

They seemed like floating flowers

They shine as sweet as simple doves

They stand like solitary mountain forms on some hard, perfectly transparent day

They vanished like the shapes that float upon a summer's dream

Thick as wind-blown leaves innumerable

Thickly the flakes drive past, each like a childish ghost

Thine eyes like two twin stars shining

This life is like a bubble blown up in the air

This love that dwells like moonlight in your face

This thought is as death

This tower rose in the sunset like a prayer

Those ancestral themes past which so many generations have slept like sea-going winds over pastures

Those death-like eyes, unconscious of the sun

Those eyelids folded like a white rose-leaf

Those eyes like bridal beacons shine

Thou art to me but as a wave of the wild sea

Thou as heaven art fair and young

Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea

Thou must wither like a rose

Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds

Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood

Though bright as silver the meridian beams shine

Though thou be black as night

Thoughts vague as the fitful breeze

Three-cornered notes fly about like butterflies

Through the forest, like a fairy dream through some dark mind, the ferns in branching beauty stream

Through the moonlit trees, like ghosts of sounds haunting the moonlight, stole the faint tinkle of a guitar

Through the riot of his senses, like a silver blaze, ran the legend

Thy beauty like a beast it bites

Thy brown benignant eyes have sudden gleams of gladness and surprise, like woodland brooks that cross a sunlit spot

Thy carven columns must have grown by magic, like a dream in stone

Thy favors are but like the wind that kisses everything it meets

Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree

Thy name burns like a gray and flickering candle flame

Thy name will be as honey on men's lips

Till death like sleep might steal on me

Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven

Time drops in decay, like a candle burnt out

Time like a pulse shakes fierce

To drag life on, which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain

To forsake as the trees drop their leaves in autumn

Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play

Transitory as clouds without substance

Transparent like a shining sun

Tree and shrub altered their values and became transmuted to silver sentinels

Trees that spread their forked boughs like a stag's antlers

Trembling like an aspen-leaf

Truths which forever shine as fixed stars

Turning easily and securely as on a perfect axle


U

Unbends like a loosened bow

Unbreakable as iron

Unconscious as an oak-tree of its growth

Under the willow-tree glimmered her face like a foam-flake drifting over the sea

Unheralded, like some tornado loosed out of the brooding hills, it came to pass

Unknown, like a seed in fallow ground, was the germ of a plan

Unmoving as a tombstone

Untameable as flies

Unutterable things pressing on my soul like a pent-up storm craving for outlet

Upcast like foam of the effacing tide

Uplifting the soul as on dovelike wings

Uplifting their stony peaks around us like the walls and turrets of a gigantic fortress

Urgent as the seas

Uttering wild cries like a creature in pain


V

Vague as a dream

Vague thoughts that stream shapelessly through her mind like long sad vapors through the twilight sky

Vanish into thin air, like ghosts at the cockcrow

Vanished like snow when comes a thaw

Vanished like vapor before the sun

Vibrations set quivering like harp strings struck by the hand of a master

Vociferous praise following like a noisy wave


W

Walking somewhat unsteadily like a blind man feeling his way

Waves glittered and danced on all sides like millions of diamonds

We left her and retraced our steps like faithless hounds

Weak and frail like the vapor of a vale

Wearing their wounds like stars

Weary wind, who wanderest like the world's rejected guest

When a draft might puff them out like a guttering candle

When arm in arm they both came swiftly running, like a pair of turtle-doves that could not live asunder day or night

When cards, invitations, and three-corn'd notes fly about like white butterflies

When she died, her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole

When the fever pierced me like a knife

Where a lamp of deathless beauty shines like a beacon

Where heroes die as leaves fall

Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on, like a mill

Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread

Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky

Whistled sharply in the air like a handful of vipers

White as a ghost from darkness

White as chalk

White as dove or lily, or spirit of the light

White as the driven snow

White as the moon's white flame

White as the sea-bird's wing

White clouds like daisies

White hands she moves like swimming swans

White hands through her hair, like white doves going into the shadow of a wood

White like flame

White sails of sloops like specters

Whose bodies are as strong as alabaster

Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king

Whose laugh moves like a bat through silent haunted woods

Whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire

Whose music like a robe of living light reclothed each new-born age

Windy speech which hits all around the mark like a drunken carpenter

Winged like an arrow to its mark

With a sting like a scorpion

With all the complacency of a homeless cat

With an angry broken roar, like billows on an unseen shore, their fury burst

With hate darkling as the swift winter hail

With music sweet as love

With sounds like breakers

With strength like steel

With the whisper of leaves in one's ear

With words like honey melting from the comb

Wits as sharp as gimlets

Women with tongues like polar needles

Words as fresh as spring verdure

Words as soft as rain

Words like the gossamer film of the summer

Words sweet as honey from his lips distill'd

Words were flashing like brilliant birds through the boughs overhead

Wordsworth, thy music like a river rolls

Worthless like the conjurer's gold

Wrangle over details like a grasping pawnbroker

Wrinkled and scored like a dried apple

Writhing with an intensity that burnt like a steady flame


Y

Yielding like melted snow

Yonder flimsy crescent, bent like an archer's bow above the snowy summit

You are as gloomy to-night as an undertaker out of employment

You are as hard as stone

You gave me such chill embraces as the snow-covered heights receive from clouds

Your blood is red like wine

Your charms lay like metals in a mine

Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake

Your eyes as blue as violets

Your eyes they were green and gray like an April day

Your frail fancies are swallowed up, like chance flowers flung upon the river's current

Your hair was golden as tints of sunrise

Your heart is as dry as a reed

Your locks are like the raven

Your love shall fall about me like sweet rain

Your step's like the rain to summer vexed farmer

Your thoughts are buzzing like a swarm of bees

Your tongue is like a scarlet snake

Your voice had a quaver in it just like the linnet

Youth like a summer morn

Good! that is at least something

Gratifying, I am sure


H

Happily there are exceptions to every rule

Has it really come to that?

Have I incurred your displeasure?

Have you any rooted objection to it?

Have you anything definite in your mind?

Have you reflected what the consequences might be to yourself?

He does me too much honor

He feels it acutely

He has a queer conception of the proprieties

He is a poor dissembler

He is anything but obtuse

He is so ludicrously wrong

He is the most guileless of men

He was so extremely susceptible

He writes uncommonly clever letters

Heaven forbid that I should wound your sensibility

His sense of humor is unquenchable

How amiable you are to say so

How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?

How can I thank you?

How can you be so unjust?

How delightful to meet you

How does the idea appeal to you?

How droll you are!

How extraordinary!

How intensely interesting!

How perfectly delightful!

How utterly abominable

How very agreeable this is!

How very interesting

How very surprising

How well you do it!

However, I should like to hear your views

Human nature interests me very much indeed


I

I admire your foresight

I admit it most gratefully

I agree--at least, I suppose I do

I agree that something ought to be done

I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere

I am absolutely bewildered

I am afraid I am not familiar enough with the subject

I am afraid I cannot suggest an alternative

I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself

I am afraid I must confess my ignorance

I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist

I am always glad to do anything to please you

I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you

I am appealing to your sense of humor

I am at your service

I am bound to secrecy

I am compelled to, unluckily

I am curious to learn what his motive was

I am deeply flattered and grateful

I am delighted to hear you say so

I am dumb with admiration

I am entirely at your disposal

I am extremely glad you approve of it

I am far from believing the maxim

I am fortunate in being able to do you a service

I am glad to be able to think that

I am glad to have had this talk with you

I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty

I am glad you can see it in that way

I am glad you feel so deeply about it

I am giving you well-deserved praise

I am going to make a confession

I am grateful for your good opinion

I am honestly indignant

I am, I confess, a little discouraged

I am in a chastened mood

I am inclined to agree with you

I am incredulous

I am indebted to you for the suggestion

I am listening--I was about to propose

I am lost in admiration

I am luckily disengaged to-day

I am more grieved than I can tell you

I am naturally overjoyed

I am not a person of prejudices

I am not an alarmist

I am not as unreasonable as you suppose

I am not at all in the secret of his ambitions

I am not capable of unraveling it

I am not going into sordid details

I am not going to let you evade the question

I am not going to pay you any idle compliments

I am not impervious to the obligations involved

I am not in sympathy with it

I am not in the least surprised

I am not inquisitive

I am not prepared to say

I am not sure that I can manage it

I am not vindictive

I am overjoyed to hear you say so

I am perfectly aware of what I am saying

I am persuaded by your candor

I am quite convinced of that

I am quite discomfited

I am quite interested to see what you will do

I am quite ready to be convinced

I am rather of the opinion that I was mistaken

I am ready to make great allowances

I am really afraid I don't know

I am really gregarious

I am sensible of the flattery

I am seriously annoyed with myself about it

I am so glad you think that

I am so sorry--so very sorry

I am sorry to disillusionize you

I am sorry to interrupt this interesting discussion

I am sorry to say it is impossible

I am speaking plainly

I am still a little of an idealist

I am suppressing many of the details

I am sure it sounds very strange to you

I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment

I am  sure you will hear me out

I am surprised, I confess

I am sustained by the prospect of a good dinner

I am vastly obliged to you

I am vastly your debtor for the information

I am very far from being a fanatic

I am very glad of this opportunity

I am very grateful--very much flattered

I am wholly in agreement with you

I am willing to accept all the consequences

I am wonderfully well

I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?

I am your creditor unawares

I anticipate your argument

I appreciate your motives

I assure you it is most painful to me

I assure you my knowledge of it is limited

I bear no malice about that

I beg your indulgence

I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously

I brazenly confess it

I can easily understand your astonishment

I can explain the apparent contradiction

I can find no satisfaction in it

I can hardly agree with you there

I can never be sufficiently grateful

I can only tell you the bare facts

I can scarcely accept the offer

I can scarcely boast that honor

I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable

I can sympathize with you

I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives

I cannot explain it even to myself

I cannot find much real satisfaction in it

I cannot forbear to press my advantage

I cannot imagine what you mean

I cannot precisely determine

I can't pretend to make a jest of what I'm going to say

I cannot say definitely at the moment

I cannot say that in fact it is always so

I cannot see how you draw that conclusion

I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration

I compliment you on your good sense

I confess, I find it difficult

I could ask for nothing better

I could never forgive myself for that

I dare say your intuition is quite right

I decline to commit myself beforehand

I detest exaggeration

I didn't mean that--exactly

I do not comprehend your meaning

I don't deny that it is interesting

I don't doubt it for a moment

I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments

I do not exactly understand you

I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views

I don't feel that it is my business

I do not find it an unpleasant subject

I don't insist on your believing me

I don't justify my presumption

I don't know quite why you should say that

I don't know that I can do that

I don't know when I have heard anything so lamentable

I don't know why you should be displeased

I don't make myself clear, I see

I don't pretend to explain

I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it

I don't underrate his kindness

I don't want to disguise that from you

I don't want to exaggerate

I don't want to seem critical

I doubt the truth of that saying

I endorse it, every word

I entirely approve of your plan

I fancy it's just that

I fear I cannot help you

I fear that's too technical for me

I feel a certain apprehension

I feel an unwonted sense of gaiety

I feel it my duty to be frank with you

I feel myself scarcely competent to judge

I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer

I find it absorbing

I find it rather monotonous

I find this agreeable mental exhilaration

I frankly confess that

I generally trust my first impressions

I give my word gladly

I give you my most sacred word of honor

I had better begin at the beginning

I had no intention of being offensive

I hadn't thought of it in that light

I hardly think that could be so

I have a hundred reasons for thinking so

I have a peculiar affection for it

I have an immense faith in him

I have been constrained by circumstances

I have been decidedly impressed

I have been longing to see more of you

I have been puzzling over a dilemma

I have every reason to think so

I have given you the best proof of it

I have gone back to my first impressions

I have known striking instances of the kind

I have never heard it put so well

I have no delusions on that score

I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that

I have not the influence you think

I have not the least doubt of it

I haven't the remotest idea

I have often a difficulty in deciding

I have often marveled at your courage

I have quite changed my opinion about that

I have something of great importance to say to you

I have sometimes vaguely felt it

I have the strongest possible prejudice against it

I heartily congratulate you

I hope it will not seem unreasonable to you

I hope we may meet again

I hope you will forgive an intruder

I hope you will not think me irreverent

I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness

I indulge the modest hope

I know it is very presumptuous

I know my request will appear singular

I like it immensely

I like your frankness

I make no reflection whatever

I mean it literally

I might question all that

I mistrust these wild impulses

I most certainly agree with you

I most humbly ask pardon

I must add my congratulations on your taste

I must apologize for intruding upon you

I must ask you one more question, if I may

I must confess I have never thought of that

I must refrain from any comment

I must respectfully decline to tell you

I must take this opportunity to tell you

I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility

I never heard anything so absurd

I offer my humblest apologies

I owe the idea wholly to you

I partly agree with you

I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness

I place myself entirely at your service

I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense

I prefer to reserve my judgment

I purposely evaded the question

I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it

I quite see what the advantages are

I really am curious to know how you guessed that

I realize how painful it must be to you

I recollect it clearly

I rely on your good sense

I remember the occasion perfectly

I resent that kind of thing

I respect you for that

I respect your critical faculty

I say it in all modesty

I see disapproval in your face

I see it from a different angle

I see you are an enthusiast

I see your point of view

I seem to have heard that sentiment before

I shall at once proceed to forget it

I shall await your pleasure

I shall be glad if you will join me

I shall be interested to watch it develop

I shall be most proud and pleased

I shall certainly take you at your word

I shall feel highly honored

I shall make a point of thinking so

I shall never forget your kindness

I shall respect your confidence

I should appreciate your confidence greatly

I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it

I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise

I should like your opinion of it

I should not dream of asking you to do so

I should think it very unlikely

I simply cannot endure it

I spoke only in jest

I stand corrected

I suppose I ought to feel flattered

I surmised as much

I sympathize deeply with you

I take that for granted

I think extremely well of it

I think he has very noble ideals

I think I can answer that for you

I think I know what you are going to say

I think it has its charm

I think it is superb!

I think it quite admirable

I think its tone is remarkably temperate

I think that is rather a brilliant idea

I think what you say is reasonable

I think you are quibbling

I think you are rather severe in your opinions

I think you have great appreciation of values

I think you have summed it up perfectly

I think your candor is charming

I thoroughly agree with you

I thought it most amusing

I thought you were seriously indisposed

I trust you will not consider it an impertinence

I understand exactly how you feel about it

I understand your delicacy of feeling

I venture to propose another plan

I very rarely allow myself that pleasure

I want to have a frank understanding with you

I was at a loss to understand the reason for it

I was hoping that I could persuade you

I was on the point of asking you

I was speaking generally

I watched you with admiration

I will answer you frankly

I will listen to no protestations

I will take it only under compulsion

I will tell you what puzzles me

I will think of it, since you wish it

I will, with great pleasure

I wish I could explain my point more fully

I wish I knew what you meant by that

I wish to be perfectly fair

I wish to put things as plainly as possible

I wonder how much truth there is in it?

I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?

I would agree if I understood

I wouldn't put it just that way

If ever I can repay it, command me

If I mistake not you were there once?

If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly

If I were disposed to offer counsel

If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning

If you don't mind my saying so

If you insist upon it

If you will pardon me the frankness

In a manner that sometimes terrifies me

In one respect you are quite right

In that case let me rob you of a few minutes

In what case, for example?

Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten

Indeed, but it is quite possible

Indeed! How?

Indeed, you are wholly wrong

Indifferently so, I am afraid

Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention

Is it sane--is it reasonable?

Isn't it amazing?

Isn't it extraordinarily funny?

Isn't it preposterous?

Isn't that a trifle unreasonable?

Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?

Is that a fair question?

It always seemed to me impossible

It amuses you, doesn't it?

It blunts the sensibilities

It could never conceivably be anything but popular

It depends on how you look at it

It depends upon circumstances

It doesn't sound plausible to me

It has a lovely situation as I remember it

It has amused me hugely

It has been a relief to talk to you

It has been an immense privilege to see you

It has never occurred to me

It is a curious fact

It is a great pleasure to meet you

It is a huge undertaking

It is a most unfortunate affair

It is a perfectly plain proposition

It is a rather melancholy thought

It is a truth universally acknowledged

It is all very inexcusable

It is all very well for you to be philosophical

It is altogether probable

It is an admirable way of putting it

It is an error of taste

It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound

It is an ingenious theory

It is an uncommonly fine description

It is extremely interesting, I can assure you

It is for you to decide

It is historically true

It is I who should ask forgiveness

It is incredible!

It is indeed generous of you to suggest it

It is inexplicable

It is interesting, as a theory

It is literally impossible

It is merely a mood

It is most unfortunate

It is my deliberately formed opinion

It is my opinion you are too conscientious

It is nevertheless true

It is not a matter of the slightest consequence

It is not always fair to judge by appearances

It is not so unreasonable as you think

It is often very misleading

It is one of the grave problems of the day

It is only a fancy of mine

It is perfectly defensible

It is perfectly trite

It is permissible to gratify such an impulse

It is possible, but I rather doubt it

It is quite an easy matter

It is quite conceivable

It is quite too absurd

It is rather startling

It is really impressive

It is really most callous of you to laugh

It is sheer madness

It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant

It is simply a coincidence

It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world

It is to you that I am indebted for all this

It is true, I am grieved to say

It is true none the less

It is very amusing

It is very far from being a fiction

It is very good of you to do this for my pleasure

It is very ingenious

It is very splendid of you

It is wanton capriciousness

It is your privilege to think so

It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss

It's a matter of immediate urgency

It's absolute folly

It's absurd--it's impossible

It's all nonsense

It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances

It's been a strange experience for you

It's deliciously honest

It's going to be rather troublesome

It's inconceivable that it should ever be necessary

It's mere pride of opinion

It's my chief form of recreation

It's not a matter of vast importance

It's past my comprehension

It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it

It's really very perplexing

It's so charming of you to say that

It's so kind of you to come

It's such a bore having to talk about it

It's the natural sequence

It's too melancholy

It's very wonderful

It makes it all quite interesting

It may sound strange to you

It must be a trifle dull at times

It must be fascinating

It must be very gratifying to you

It must have been rather embarrassing

It seems an age since we've last seen you

It seems entirely wonderful to me

It seems incredible

It seems like a distracting dream

It seems preposterous

It seems the height of absurdity

It seems to me that you have a perfect right to do so

It seems unspeakably funny to me

It seems very ridiculous

It shall be as you wish

It should not be objectionable

It sounds plausible

It sounds profoundly interesting

It sounds rather appalling

It sounds very alluring

It strikes me as rather pathetic

It was an unpardonable liberty

It was inevitable that you should say that

It was most stupid of me to have forgotten it

It was not unkindly meant

It was peculiarly unfortunate

It was really an extraordinary experience

It was so incredible

It was the most amazing thing I ever heard

It was very good of you to come out and join us

It will create a considerable sensation

It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject

It will give me pleasure to do it

It will not alter my determination

It would be ill-advised

It would interest me very much

It would seem to be a wise decision

It would take too long to formulate my thought


J

Join us, please, when you have time

Just trust to the inspiration of the moment

Justify it if you can


L

Let me persuade you

Let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness

Let me speak frankly

Let us grant that for the sake of the argument

Let us take a concrete instance


M

Many thanks--how kind and good you are!

May I ask to whom you allude?

May I be privileged to hear it?

May I speak freely?

May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that?

Might I suggest an alternative?

Most dangerous!

My attitude would be one of disapproval

My confidence in you is absolute

My idea of it is quite the reverse

My information is rather scanty

My meaning is quite the contrary

My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it

My views are altered in many respects


N

No, I am speaking seriously

No, I don't understand it

Not at all

Not to my knowledge

Nothing could be more delightful

Now is it very plain to you?

Now you are flippant


O

Obviously the matter is settled

Of course, but that again isn't the point

Of course I am delighted

Of course I don't want to press you against your will

Of course you will do what you think best

Oh, certainly, if you wish it

Oh, do not form an erroneous impression

Oh, I appreciate that in you!

Oh, that's mere quibbling

Oh, that's splendid of you!

Oh, that was a manner of speaking

Oh, yes, I quite admit that

Oh, yes, you may take that for granted

Oh, you are very bitter

Oh, you may be as scornful as you like

On the contrary, I agree with you thoroughly

On the face of it, it sounds reasonable

One assumption you make I should like to contest

One has no choice to endure it

One must be indulgent under the circumstances

One thing I beg of you


P

Pardon me, but I don't think so

Pardon me, I meant something different

Perhaps I am indiscreet

Perhaps not in the strictest sense

Perhaps you do not feel at liberty to do so

Perhaps you think me ungrateful

Personally I confess to an objection

Please continue to be frank

Please do not think I am asking out of mere curiosity

Please forgive my thoughtlessness

Please make yourself at home

Pray don't apologize

Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously

Pray go on!

Precisely, that is just what I meant

Put in that way it certainly sounds very well


Q

Question me, if you wish

Quibbling, I call it

Quite so

Quite the wisest thing you can do


R

Rather loquacious, I think

Reading between the lines

Really? I should have thought otherwise

Really--you must go?

Reassure me, if you can

Reflect upon the possible consequences

Relatively speaking

Reluctantly I admit it

Reverting to another matter


S

Shall we have a compact?

She has an extraordinary gift of conversation

She is easily prejudiced

She seems uncommonly appreciative

She will be immensely surprised

Show me that the two cases are analogous

So far so good

So I inferred

So much the better for me

So you observe the transformation?

Something amuses you

Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me

Speaking with all due respect

Still, you might make an exception

Strangely it's true

Such conduct seems to me unjustifiable

Surely there can be no question about that

Surely we can speak frankly

Surely you sound too harsh a note

Surely you would not countenance that


T

Tell me in what way you want me to help you

Thank you for telling me that

Thank you for your good intentions

That, at least, you will agree to

That depends on one's point of view

That doesn't sound very logical

That is a counsel of perfection

That is a fair question, perhaps

That is a question I have often proposed to myself

That is a stroke of good fortune

That is a superb piece of work

That is a very practical explanation

That is admirably clear

That is certainly ideal

That is eminently proper

That is hardly consistent

That is inconceivable

That is just like you, if you will forgive me for saying so

That is most fortunate

That is most kind of you

That is most unexpected and distressing

That is not fair--to me

That is not to be lightly spoken of

That is precisely what I mean

That is quite true, theoretically

That is rather a difficult question to answer

That is rather a strange request to make

That is rather awkward

That is really good of you

That is the prevailing idea

That is tragic

That is true and I think you are right

That is very amiable in you

That is very curious

That is very felicitous

That is very gracious

That is what I call intelligent criticism

That is what I meant to tell you

That is a humiliating thought

That is a most interesting idea

That is such a hideous idea

That is the most incredible part of it

That might involve you in life-long self-reproach

That must be exceedingly tiresome

That ought to make you a little lenient

That reassures me

That shows the infirmity of his judgment

That theory isn't tenable

That was exceedingly generous

That was intended ironically

That was very thoughtful of you

That was very well reasoned

That will blast your chances, I am afraid

That will suit me excellently

That would be somewhat serious

That would be very discreditable

The agreement seems to be ideal

The idea is monstrous

The inference is obvious

The notion is rather new to me

The pleasure is certainly not all on your side

The reason is not so far to seek

The same problem has perplexed me

The sentiment is worthy of you

The simplest thing in the world

The situation is uncommonly delicate

The story seems to me incredible

The subject is extremely interesting

The tone of it was certainly hostile

The very obvious moral is this

The whole thing is an idle fancy

Then I have your permission?

Then you're really not disinclined?

Then you merely want to ask my advice?

There are endless difficulties

There are reasons which make such a course impossible

There is a good deal of sense in that

There is a grain of truth in that, I admit

There is food for reflection in that

There is my hand on it

There is no resisting you

There is nothing I should like so much

There is one inevitable condition

There is something almost terrifying about it

There must be extenuating circumstances

They amuse me immensely

This is a most unexpected pleasure

This is charmingly new to me

This is indeed good fortune

This is really appalling

This is really not a laughing matter

Those are my own private feelings

Those things are not forgotten at once

To me it's simply outrageous

To speak frankly, I do not like it

True, I forgot!


U

Undeniably true

Unfortunately I must decline the proposal

Unlikely to be so

Unquestionably superior

Unwholesome influence, I would say


V

Very good, I'll do so

Very well, I will consent

Vivacity is her greatest charm

Virtually accomplished, I believe

Vouch for its truth


W

We are all more or less susceptible

We are drifting away from our point

We are impervious to certain rules

We are merely wasting energy in this duel

We can safely take it for granted

We couldn't have a better topic

We had better agree to differ

We have had some conclusions in common

We must judge it leniently

We must not expose ourselves to misinterpretation

We owe you a debt of gratitude

We shall be glad to see you, if you care to come

We will devoutly hope not

Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten

Well done! I congratulate you

Well, I'm not going to argue that

Well, I call it scandalous

Well, I confess they don't appeal to me

Well, more's the pity

Well, perhaps it is none of my affair

Well, that is certainly ideal!

Well, this is good fortune

Well, yes--in a way

Well, you are a dreamer!

What a beautiful idea

What a charming place you have here

What a curious coincidence!

What a pretty compliment!

What a tempting prospect!

What an extraordinary idea!

What are your misgivings?

What can you possibly mean?

What conceivable reason is there for it?

What do you imagine my course should be?

What do you propose?

What is the next step in your argument?

What is there so strange about that?

What, may I ask, is your immediate object?

What unseemly levity on his part

What very kind things you say to me

What would you expect me to do?

What you have just said is even truer than you realize

What you propose is utterly impossible

Who is your sagacious adviser?

Why ask such embarrassing questions?

Why did you desert us so entirely?

Why do you take it so seriously?

Will you allow me to ask you a question?

Will you be more explicit?

Will you have the kindness to explain?

Will you pardon my curiosity?

Will you permit me a brief explanation?

Would you apply that to everyone?

Would you mind telling me your opinion?


Y

Yes and no

Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend

Yes, I dare say

Yes, if you will be so good

Yes, it was extraordinarily fine

Yes, that is my earnest wish

Yes, that's undeniable

Yes? You were saying?

You agree with me, I know

You are a profound philosopher

You are a severe critic

You are delightfully frank

You are greatly to be envied

You are heartily welcome

You are incomprehensible

You are incorrigible

You are kind and comforting

You are most kind

You are not consistent

You are not serious, I hope

You are not seriously displeased with me?

You are quite delightful

You are rather puzzling to-day

You are right to remind me of that

You are unduly distressing yourself

You are very complimentary

You are very gracious

You're so tremendously kind about it

You're succeeding admirably

You're taking it all much too seriously

You're talking nonsense!

You're very good, I'm sure

You ask me--but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do

You astonish me greatly

You behaved with great forbearance

You can hardly be serious

You cannot regret it more than I do

You could not pay me a higher compliment

You did it excellently

You did not clearly understand what I meant

You don't seem very enthusiastic

You excite my curiosity

You flatter my judgment

You have a genius for saying the right thing

You have asked me a riddle

You have asked the impossible

You have been wrongly informed

You have done me a great service

You have had a pleasant time, I hope

You have my deepest sympathy

You have my unbounded confidence

You have received a false impression

You have such an interesting way of putting things

You interest me deeply

You judge yourself too severely

You know I'm in an agony of curiosity

You know I'm not given to sentimentality

You know the familiar axiom

You leave no alternative

You look incredulous

You may be sure of my confidence

You may rely on me absolutely

You might make an exception

You must have misunderstood me

You must not fail to command me

You overwhelm me with your kindness

You really insist upon it?

You rebuke me very fairly

You say that as though you were surprised

You see how widely we differ

You see, it's all very vague

You see things rose-colored

You seem to be in a happy mood

You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose

You shock me more than I can say

You speak in enigmas

You speak with authority

You surely understand my position

You take a great deal for granted

You take a pessimistic view of things

You take me quite by surprise

You will admit I have some provocation

You will become morbid if you are not careful

You will have ample opportunity

You will, of course, remember the incident

You will please not be flippant

You will understand my anxiety

Your argument is facile and superficial

Your consideration is entirely misplaced

Your judgments are very sound

Your logic is as clever as possible

Your opinion will be invaluable to me

Your request is granted before it is made

Your statement is somewhat startling



SECTION X

PUBLIC SPEAKING PHRASES


A

A fact of vast moment

A few words will suffice to answer

A further objection is

A great many people have said

A little indulgence may be due to those

A majority of us believe

A man in my situation has

A more plausible objection is found

A proof of this is

A servile mind can never know

A short time since

A specific answer can be given

A thought occurred to me

Able men have reasoned out

Above all things, let us not forget

Absolutely true it is

Abundant reason is there

Accordingly by reason of this circumstance

Add this instance to

After a careful study of all the evidence

After full deliberation

After reminding the hearer

After this it remains only to say

Again, can we doubt

Again, I ask the gentleman

Again, in this view

Again, it is quite clear that

Again, it is urged

Again, let us compare

Again, very numerous are the cases

Again, we have abundant instances

Against all this concurring testimony

All confess this to be true

All I ask is

All of us know

All that I will say now

All the facts which support this

All the signs of the time indicate

All these things you know

All this being considered

All this is historical fact

All this is very well

All this suggests

All this we take for granted

Allow me for a moment to turn to

Allow me to tell a story

Altho I say it to myself

Amazing as it may seem

Am I mistaken in this

Among many examples

Among the distinguished guests who honor

Among the problems that confront us

An answer to this is now ready

An argument has often been put forward

An example or two will illustrate

An indescribably touching incident

An opinion has now become established

And again, it is said

And again, it is to be presumed

And coming nearer to our own day

And did a man try to persuade me

And do you really think

And everybody here knows

And for myself, as I said

And further, all that I have said

And hence the well-known doctrine

And here again, when I speak

And here allow me to call your attention

And here I am led to observe

And here I come to the closing evidence

And here I have an opportunity

And here I reproach

And here I wish you to observe

And here let me define my position

And here let me give my explanation

And here let us recall to mind

And how is it possible to imagine

And I am bound to say

And I beg of you

And I call on you

And I might say this

And I refuse assent

And I rejoice to know

And I say, it were better for you

And I should in like manner repudiate

And I speak with reverence

And I submit to you

And I trust that you will consider

And I will make a practical suggestion

And I will tell you why

And I would, moreover submit

And if a man could anywhere be found

And if any of you should question

And if I know anything of my countrymen

And if I may presume to speak

And if I take another instance

And if this be true

And if you come to a decision

And if you think it your duty

And in conclusion

And in like manner

And in order to see this

And in thus speaking, I am not denying

And is not this lamentable

And is there not a presumption

And it happens

And it is certainly true

And it is doubtful if

And it is not difficult to see

And it is not plain

And it is one of the evidences

And it is precisely in this

And it is strikingly suggested to us

And it is undeniable, I say

And it is well that this should be so

And last of all

And lest anyone should marvel

And let it be observed

And lo! and behold

And more than this

And next I would ask

And now allow me to call attention

And now behold a mystery

And now consider

And now having discussed

And now I beg that I may be permitted

And now I go back to the statement

And now I have completed my review

And now I have said enough to explain

And now I must touch upon one point

And now if I may take for granted

And now it would be very pleasant for me

And now observe how

And now, sir, what I had first to say

And now supposing this point to be settled

And now that I have mentioned

And now the chief points of it

And now the question is asked me

And now, to close, let me give you

And now, to what purpose do I mention

And, of course, you are aware

And of this I am perfectly certain

And quite as difficult is it to create

And right here lies the cause

And, sir, a word

And so, again, as regard

And so I am reminded of a story

And so I leave these words with you

And so I may point out

And so I might recount to you

And so, in the other cases, I have named

And so in the present case

And so on

And so through all phases

And so, upon every hand

And sometimes it will be difficult

And that gave another distorted view

And the reason is very obvious

And the same holds good

And then again

And then hastily to conclude

And then I may be reminded

And then there is another thought

And then when it is said

And there are reasons why

And there is also this view

And therefore am I truly glad

And therefore it is not unfrequently quoted

And therefore it is not without regret

And this brings me to the last thing

And this is really the sense

And this leads me to say a word

And thus consistently

And thus it is conceivable

And thus it seems to me

And thus we are led on then to further question

And to all this must be added

And to return to the topic

And to this conclusion you must come

And unquestionably

And we are brought to the same conclusion

And what do you suppose will be

And when I have shown to you

And when I recall that event

And when we pass beyond the bounds of

And where, let me ask

And why should I insist

And will you still insist

And with these thoughts come others

And yet I can not but reflect

And yet I feel justified in believing

And yet I think we all feel

And yet let me say to you

And yet one more quotation

And yet this notion is, I conceive

And yet though this be true

And yet we ought, if we are wise

And you may also remember this

Another circumstance that adds to the difficulty

Another consideration which I shall adduce

Another instance of signal success

Another of these presumptions

Another point is made as clear as crystal

Another reason of a kindred nature

Another reflection which occurs to me

Another sign of our times

Another signal advantage

Another striking instance

Answers doubtless may be given

Are there not many of us

Are we content to believe

Are we forever to deprive ourselves

Are we not startled into astonishment

Are we satisfied to assume

As a general rule I hold

As a last illustration

As a matter of fact

As a proof of this

As an illustration of this truth

As briefly as I may

As far as my limits allow

As far as this is true

As far as this objection relates

As far as we know

As for the rest

As I have now replied to

As I look around on this assembly

As I rise to respond to the sentiment

As I understand this matter

As memory scans the past

As society is now constituted

As some one has well said

As the foregoing instances have shown

As to the particular instance before us

As well might we compare

As we shall see in a few moments

Assuredly it is this

At the outset of this inquiry

At the risk of digression

At the same time, I candidly state

At the utmost we can say

At this juncture

At this solemn moment

Away then with the notion


B

Be assured, then

Be confident, therefore

Be it so

Be not deceived

Be sure that in spite of

Be these things as they may

Be your interests what they may be

Bear with me for a few moments

Bearing on this point

Before attempting to answer this question

Before going further

Before I close I will particularly remark

Before I come to the special matter

Before I proceed to compare

Being fully of the opinion

Being persuaded then

Believing, as I do

Beyond all question we

Bidden by your invitation to a discussion

Broadly speaking

But, above all things, let us

But after all, I think no one can say

But again, when we carefully consider

But am I wrong in saying

But apart from the fact

But besides these special facts

But can this question

But depend upon it

But despite all this

But do not let us depend

But do you imagine

But doubts here arise

But even admitting these possibilities

But everyone who deserves

But first of all, remark, I beg you

But, further, I shall now demonstrate

But, gentlemen, I must be done

But grave problems confront us

But here I am discussing

But here let me say

But how can we pass over

But how shall I describe my emotions

But however that may be

But I am bound to say

But I am certain from my own experience

But I am very sorry to say

But I am willing enough to admit

But I can at least say

But I can not conceive

But I can promise

But I cherish the hope

But I confess that I should be glad

But I digress

But I do not propose all these things

But I do say this

But I have been insisting simply

But I have heard it argued

But I have no fear of the future

But I leave this train of thought

But I may be permitted to speak

But I may say in conclusion

But I need hardly assert

But I pass that over

But I propose to speak to you

But I repeat

But I resist the temptation

But I return to the question

But I shall go still further

But I simply ask

But I submit the whole subject

But I trust that you will all admit

But I venture to assure you

But I will allude

But I will not further impress any idea

But I would earnestly impress upon you

But if I may even flatter myself

But if I seek for illustrations

But if you want more evidence

But if you wish to know

But in making this assertion

But in my opinion there is no need

But in the course of time

But is it quite possible to hold

But is this any reason why

But it does not follow from this

But it happens very fortunately

But it has been suggested to me

But it is a fact

But it is impossible for one

But it is necessary to explain

But it is no use protesting

But it is not fair to assert

But it is not my intention

But it is not necessary to suppose

But it is not possible to believe

But it is not really so

But it is otherwise with

But it is sometimes said

But it may be doubted whether

But it may happen that I forgot

But it will be a misfortune

But it will naturally be asked

But it will perhaps be argued

But it would be vain to attempt

But let me ask you to glance

But let me before closing refer

But let none of you think

But let us also keep ever in mind

But let us look a little further

But lo! all of a sudden

But mark this

But more than all things else

But my allotted time is running away

But my answer to this objection

But, my friends, pause for a moment

But never was a grosser wrong

But not for one moment

But notwithstanding all this

But now look at the effect

But now take notice of

But on the other hand

But on what ground are we

But passing these by

But perhaps I ought to speak distinctly

But perhaps you are not yet weary

But putting these questions aside

But quite contrary to this, you will find

But recollect, I pray you, how

But, sir, it is manifest

But some other things are to be noted

But some will ask me

But sooner or later

But still, I repeat

But suppose the fact

But surely, you can not say

But that I may not divert you from

But that is not all

But that must be always the impression

But the fact is

But the final value

But the greatest proof of all

But the most formidable problem

But the necessity of the case

But the question may arise

But, then, let us ask ourselves

But there is another duty imposed

But there is much more than this

But this I do not hesitate to say

But this I fearlessly affirm

But this I know

But this is a circuitous argument

But this is no place for controversy

But this is not all

But this is what I mean

But this much I affirm as true

But this warns me

But this we may put aside

But to go still further

But to say the truth

But we are met with the assertion

But we are to recollect

But we ask, perhaps

But we may depend upon it

But we think it is not wise

But we want something more for explanation

But what a blunder would be yours

But what is the fact

But what we must needs guard against

But when it is declared

But when we look a little deeper

But while it may be admitted

But who has not seen

But why do I numerate these details

But with these exceptions

But yet nothing can be more splendid

But you should know

By no means

By the way, I have not mentioned

By this time it will be suspected


C

Can it be supposed

Can the long records of humanity teach us

Can there be a better illustration

Can we pretend

Can you lightly contemplate

Can you yield yourselves

Cautious and practical thinkers ask

Certain it is

Certainly I am not blind to the faults

Certainly, one can conceive

Clearly enough

Coming back to the main subject

Coming down to modern times

Coming to present circumstances

Common sense indicates

Consequently, I am not discussing this matter

Consider, I beg you, what

Contemplating these marvelous changes


D

Delude not yourselves with the belief

Depend upon it

Did it ever occur to you

Difficult then as the question may be

Do I need to describe

Do me the honor of believing

Do not imagine

Do not let us conceal from ourselves

Do not suppose for a moment

Do not talk to me of

Do not think me guilty of

Do we not know

Do what you will

Do you ask how that can be

Do you believe this can be truthfully said

Do you not know I am speaking of

Do you remember a concrete instance

Do you think, then

Does any man say

Does it ever occur to you

Does it not seem something like idiocy to

Does it not shock you to think

Does not the event show

Does not the nature of every man revolt

Doubtless the end is sought


E

Every now and then you will find

Every one has asked himself

Every one therefore ought to look to

Every reader of history can recall


F

Far from it

Few indeed there are

Few subjects are more fruitful

Few things impress the imagination more

Finally, it is my most fervent prayer

First in my thoughts are

First of all I ask

For, be assured of this

For behold

For I must tell you

For if any one thinks that there is

For, in truth, if you please to recollect

For instance, I can fancy

For is it not true

For it is not right to

For let it be observed first

For mark you

For my own part, I believe

For myself, certainly I think

For observe what the real fact is

For one I deny

For, perhaps, after all

For, perhaps, some one may say

For so it generally happens

For the sake of my argument

For this is what I say

For this reason, indeed, it is

For we all know

Fortunately for us

Fortunately I am not obliged

From one point of view we are

From the circumstances already explained

From the standpoint of

From this statement you will perceive


G

Generally speaking

God be praised

Grant this true

Granting all this


H

Had I time for all that might be said

Had my limits allowed it

Happily for us

Hardly less marvelous

Hardly will anyone venture to say

Have I exaggerated

Have you ever noticed

Having taken a view of

Having thus described what appears to me

He is the best prophet who

He seems at times to confuse

He was an eminent instance of

He who is insensible to

Hence arises a grave mischief

Hence, as I have said

Hence it follows

Here again the testimony corroborates

Here arises the eternal question

Here comes the practical matter

Here for a moment I seem

Here, however, it may be objected

Here I am considering

Here I end my illustrations

Here I must pause for a moment

Here I only insist upon

Here I ought to stop

Here is another strange thing

Here is good hope for us

Here is no question

Here let me meet one other question

Here, then, I am brought to the consideration

Here then I take up the subject

Here then is the key

Here, then, it is natural at last

Here then, we are brought to the question

Here, then, we are involved

Here undoubtedly it is

Here we can not but pause to contemplate

Here we come into direct antagonism with

Here we come to the very crux of

Here we have it on high authority

History is replete with predictions

Hitherto I have spoken only of

Holding this view, I am concerned

How can we help believing

How do you account for

How does it happen

How human language staggers when

How infinitely difficult it is

How infinitely superior must it appear

How is this to be explained

How many a time

How momentous, then

How much better, I say, if

How much more rational it would be

How shall I attempt to enumerate

How shall I describe to you

However, I am viewing the matter

However, I will not in any way admit

However, it is to me a very refreshing thing


I

I abide by my statement

I add a few suggestions

I adduce these facts

I admire the main drift of

I admit, of course, at once

I admit the extreme complexity

I again ask

I allude to

I always delight to think

I always will assert the right to

I am a great admirer

I am a little at a loss to know

I am about to supplement

I am agitated by conflicting emotions

I am alarmed, indeed, when I see

I am also bound to say

I am also satisfied

I am apprehensive

I am asked to-night to propose

I am assured and fully believe

I am at a loss for adequate terms

I am bold to say

I am but saying

I am by no means certain

I am certain that you will give me credit

I am certainly in earnest sympathy

I am confronted by the hope

I am conscious of the fact

I am convinced by what I have seen

I am deeply imbued with the conviction

I am deeply insensible of the compliment

I am determined

I am even bold enough to hazard

I am exceeding my necessary limits

I am exceedingly glad of this opportunity

I am extremely obliged to you

I am familiar with

I am far from asserting

I am filled with admiration

I am firmly convinced

I am free to admit

I am fully convinced

I am giving voice to what you all feel

I am glad of this public opportunity

I am glad to answer to the toast

I am glad to express the belief

I am glad to notice

I am going to spare you and myself

I am grateful to you for this honor

I am greatly alarmed

I am greatly indebted to you

I am happy to be with you

I am here by the favor of your invitation

I am here the advocate of

I am here to introduce

I am in favor of

I am in sympathy with

I am inclined sometimes to believe

I am inclined to suspect

I am indebted for the honor

I am, indeed, most solicitous

I am informed

I am led on by these reflections

I am led to believe

I am mainly concerned

I am most deeply sensible of the welcome

I am most grateful for the opportunity

I am myself greatly indebted

I am nevertheless too sensible

I am not a stranger to

I am not at liberty to discuss

I am not at present concerned

I am not about to defend

I am not advocating

I am not altogether clear

I am not aware of a single instance

I am not blind to the faults of

I am not bold enough to

I am not catching at sharp arguments

I am not concerned to argue

I am not defending myself

I am not dreaming of denying

I am not going into vexed questions

I am not going to reproach

I am not here to defend

I am not insensible

I am not of those who pretend

I am not prepared to dispute the word

I am not presumptuous to assert

I am not proposing to set forth

I am not ripe to pass sentence

I am not so unreasonable as to tell you

I am not surprised

I am not taking into account

I am not unaware

I am not undertaking to deliver

I am now going to attempt

I am obliged to add

I am obliged to go still further

I am often reminded

I am old enough to remember

I am one of those who believe

I am only too sensible of the fact

I am perfectly willing to admit

I am persuaded

I am prepared to back that opinion by

I am privileged to speak to

I am quite conscious that

I am rather disposed to think

I am ready to do battle

I am reassured by the presence here

I am reluctantly but forcibly reminded

I am resolved not to permit

I am sensible, sir

I am simply endeavoring to show

I am so surrounded on every hand

I am sometimes inclined to think

I am somewhat relieved to know

I am sorry to say

I am suggesting the reason why

I am sure, at any rate

I am sure every impartial man will agree

I am sure I feel no hostility

I am sure that I echo the sentiment

I am sure this generous audience will pardon me

I am sure you all hope

I am sure you feel the truth

I am sure you will acquit me

I am sure you will be kind enough

I am sure you will do me the justice

I am sure you will not be surprised

I am surely not here to assert

I am tempted further to offer to you

I am thankful for the privilege

I am thoroughly convinced

I am to speak to you this evening

I am to urge the interest of

I am told occasionally

I am told on authority

I am too well aware of the difficulties

I am totally at a loss to conceive

I am trespassing too long on your time

I am unable to understand

I am unconscious of intentional error

I am under a very great obligation

I am under the deepest feeling of gratitude

I am under the impression

I am unwillingly bound to add

I am uttering no paradox when I say

I am very far from thinking.

I am very glad to have the honor

I am very happy to be here

I am very much in the condition of

I am very sure that if you ponder

I am very sure you will believe

I am well aware

I am willing to know

I anticipate with pleasing expectation

I appeal in the first place

I appeal to any man to say

I appeal to the better judgment

I appreciate the significance

I argue this cause

I ask again

I ask no greater blessing

I ask permission to speak to you

I ask the attention

I ask the audience

I ask the audience to return with me

I ask this of you

I ask you calmly and dispassionately

I ask you gentlemen, do you think

I ask you if it is possible

I ask you, if you please, to rise and give the toast

I ask you in all candor

I ask you now to follow me

I ask you to consider

I ask you to join me in drinking a toast

I ask you to pledge with me

I ask your attention

I ask your indulgence

I assert, sir, that it is

I assure myself

I assure you, of my own personal knowledge

I attribute it to

I avail myself of the opportunity

I beg again to thank you for the honor

I beg all to remember

I beg and implore of you

I beg emphatically to say

I beg leave to make some observations

I beg of you to remember

I beg to tender my most fervent wishes

I beg you not to mistake my meaning

I beg you to accept my grateful expression

I begin by observing

I begin with expressing a sentiment

I believe from my own personal experience

I believe I can speak for all

I believe I shall make it clear to you

I believe I voice the sentiment

I believe it to be the simple truth

I believe most profoundly

I believe that I am within the mark

I believe that in this instance

I bid you a most cordial and hearty welcome

I bow with you in reverent commemoration

I call on you to answer

I call to mind how

I can by no calculation justify

I call hardly conceive

I can make allowance for

I can most truthfully assure you

I call never sufficiently express my gratitude

I can not allow myself to believe

I can not avoid confessing

I can not be content with

I can not believe, I will not believe

I can not better illustrate this argument

I can not better sum up

I can not boast of

I can not bound my vision

I can not but reflect

I can not but see what mischief

I can not charge myself with

I can not close without giving expression

I can not conceive a greater honor

I can not feel any doubt myself

I can not forbear from offering

I can not give you a better illustration

I can not help expressing a wish

I can not help speaking urgently

I can not here go into details

I can not hesitate to say

I can not hope adequately to respond

I can not justly be responsible because

I can not let this opportunity pass

I can not persuade myself

I can not prevail on myself

I can not refrain from saying for myself

I can not resist the train of thought

I can not say how glad I am

I can not say with confidence

I can not stop to give in detail

I can not sufficiently thank you

I can not take back my word

I can not take it for granted

I can not thank you enough

I can not well avoid saying

I can only congratulate you

I can only hope for indulgence

I can readily understand

I can scarcely concede anything more important

I can scarcely find fitting words

I can strongly recommend

I can understand, moreover

I can with propriety speak here

I certainly have not so good an opinion

I challenge any man

I cheerfully own

I cheerfully submit myself

I claim a share also for

I class them altogether under the head

I close with the words

I close with this sentiment

I come at length to

I come next to the question of

I come to the other assumption

I conceive this to be

I confess I feel not the least alarmed

I confess I have had my doubts

I confess I have little sympathy

I confess it affects me very deeply to

I confess it is very difficult to

I confess that I do not entirely approve

I confess that it is a comfort to me

I confess that my notions are widely different

I confess to a little embarrassment

I confess to you that I have no fear

I confine myself to saying

I congratulate you upon the auspicious character

I consider I have said enough in proof

I consider it amply explains

I contend

I content myself with pursuing

I could do no less than

I could easily mention

I could enlarge upon it

I could never understand

I could wish that this belief

I dare say you know

I dare venture the remark

I declare to you

I deem it both necessary and just

I deem it proper here to remind

I deem myself honored

I deny, once and for all

I deny the inference

I desire to be brief

I desire to bear my testimony

I desire to call attention

I desire to know

I desire to lay emphatic stress

I dissent from the opinion

I distrust all general theories of

I do again and again urge upon you

I do, indeed, recollect

I do not absolutely assert

I do not advocate

I do not argue

I do not ask you to

I do not at this moment remember

I do not believe it possible

I do not belong to those who

I do not choose to consume

I do not complain of

I do not consider it necessary

I do not contend

I do not countenance for a moment

I do not deem it incumbent upon me

I do not depreciate for a moment

I do not desire to call in question

I do not desire to put too much emphasis

I do not despair of surmounting

I do not disguise the fact

I do not enter into the question

I do not fail to admire

I do not fear a contradiction

I do not feel at liberty

I do not forget the practical necessity

I do not hesitate to say

I do not imagine

I do not in the least degree

I do not indeed deny

I do not indulge in the delusion

I do not know how anyone can believe

I do not know whether you are aware of it

I do not know why

I do not know with what correctness

I do not mean anything so absurd

I do not mean now to go further than

I do not mean to impute

I do not merely urge

I do not mistrust

I do not myself pretend to be

I do not need to remind you

I do not, of course, deny

I do not pretend to argue

I do not propose to take up your time

I do not question for a moment

I do not recount all

I do not say anything about the future

I do not say this with any affectation

I do not see how it is possible

I do not see much difference between

I do not seek to palliate

I do not speak exclusively

I do not stop to discuss

I do not, therefore, wonder

I do not think it necessary to warn you

I do not think it possible

I do not think it unfair reasoning

I do not think myself obliged to dwell

I do not think that I need further discuss

I do not think this at all an exaggeration

I do not think we can go far wrong

I do not think you will often hear

I do not understand how it can apply

I do not vouch for

I do not want to discourage you

I do not wish to be considered egotistic

I do not wish to be misrepresented

I do not wonder

I doubt very much whether

I dwell with pleasure on the considerations

I earnestly maintain

I embrace with peculiar satisfaction

I end as I began

I entertain great apprehension for

I entertain no such chimerical hopes

I entertain the hope and opinion

I entirely dissent from the view

I especially hail with approval

I even add this

I even venture to deny

I fancy I hear you say

I fear I may seem trifling

I fear lest I may

I fearlessly appeal

I fearlessly challenge

I feel a great necessity to

I feel bound to add my expression

I feel constrained to declare

I feel entirely satisfied

I feel I have a right to say

I feel it a proud privilege

I feel keenly myself impelled by every duty

I feel only a great emotion of gratitude

I feel respect and admiration

I feel some explanation is due

I feel sure

I feel tempted to introduce here

I feel that I have a special right to

I feel that it is not true

I feel the greatest satisfaction

I feel the task is far beyond my power

I fervently trust

I find it difficult to utter in words

I find it more easy

I find my reference to this

I find myself called upon to say something

I find myself in the position of

I find no better example than

I find no fault with

I find numberless cases

I flatter myself

I, for my part, would rather

I, for one, greatly doubt

I forbear to inquire

I foresaw the consequence

I fully recognize

I gave notice just now

I give you, in conclusion, this sentence

I go further

I grant all this

I grant with my warmest admiration

I gratefully accept

I greatly deplore

I had a kind of hope

I had almost said

I had in common with others

I had occasion to criticize

I happen to differ

I hardly dare to dwell longer

I hardly know anything more strange

I hasten to concede

I have a dark suspicion

I have a great admiration for

I have a pleasing and personal duty

I have a profound pity for those

I have a right to consider

I have a strong belief

I have a very high respect for

I have abstained from

I have acquired some useful experience

I have all along implied

I have all but finished

I have already alluded to

I have already shown the ground of my hope

I have already stated, and now repeat

I have always been under the impression

I have always listened with the greatest satisfaction

I have always maintained

I have another objection

I have another observation to add

I have anticipated the objection

I have assumed throughout

I have attempted thus hastily

I have barely touched some of the points

I have been allowed the privilege

I have been asked several times

I have been extremely anxious

I have been given to understand

I have been glad to observe

I have been heretofore treating

I have been insisting then on this

I have been interested in hearing

I have been pointing out how

I have been profoundly moved

I have been requested to say a word

I have been told by an eminent authority

I have been too long accustomed to hear

I have been touched by the large generosity

I have been trying to show

I have before me the statistics

I have but one more word to add

I have demonstrated to you

I have depicted

I have endeavored to emphasize

I have enlarged on this subject

I have felt it almost a duty to

I have found great cause for wonder

I have frequently been surprised at

I have gazed with admiration

I have generally observed

I have gone so far as to suggest

I have good reason for

I have had steadily in mind

I have had the honor

I have had to take a long sweep

I have heard it objected

I have heard with relief and pleasure

I have hitherto been adducing instances

I have hitherto been engaged in showing

I have in a measure anticipated

I have in my possession

I have incidentally dwelt on

I have introduced it to suggest

I have labored to maintain

I have laid much stress upon

I have lately observed many strong indications

I have listened with the utmost interest

I have little hope that I can add anything

I have lived to see

I have long ago insisted

I have long been of the conviction

I have never heard it suggested

I have never whispered a syllable

I have no acquaintance with

I have no doubt whatever

I have no excuse for intruding

I have no fear of myself

I have no fears for the success

I have no hesitation in asserting

I have no intention to moralize

I have no particular inclination

I have no prejudice on the subject

I have no pretention to be regarded

I have no reason to think

I have no scruple in saying

I have no such gloomy forebodings

I have no sympathy with the men

I have no thought of venturing to say

I have no wish at all to preach

I have not accustomed myself

I have not allowed myself

I have not been able to deny

I have not particularly referred to

I have not said anything yet

I have not the means of forming a judgment

I have not the right to reproach

I have not time to present

I have nothing more to say

I have noticed of late years

I have now explained to you

I have now made bold to touch upon

I have now rather more than kept my word

I have now said all that occurs to me

I have often been impressed with

I have often been struck with the resemblance

I have often lingered in fancy

I have one step farther to go

I have only partially examined

I have partly anticipated

I have pleasant memories of

I have pointed out

I have pride and pleasure in quoting

I have racked this brain of mine

I have read with great regret

I have said and I repeat

I have said over and over again

I have said what I solemnly believe

I have scant patience

I have seen for myself

I have seen it stated in a recent journal

I have seen some signs of encouragement

I have shown

I have some sort of fear

I have sometimes asked myself

I have sometimes fancied

I have sometimes wondered whether

I have still two comments to make

I have taken pains to know

I have the confident hope

I have the greatest possible confidence

I have the honor to propose

I have then to investigate

I have thought it incumbent on me

I have thought it right on this day

I have thought it well to suggest

I have throughout highly appreciated

I have thus been led by my feelings

I have thus stated the reason

I have to confess with a feeling of melancholy

I have to force my imagination

I have touched very cursorily

I have tried to convey to you

I have undertaken to speak

I have very much less feeling of

I have watched with some attention

I have witnessed the extraordinary

I have yet a more cogent reason

I have yet to learn

I hazard nothing in saying

I hear it sometimes said

I hear you say to yourselves

I heartily feel the singular claims

I hesitate to take an instance

I hold it to be clearly expedient

I hold myself obliged to

I hold the maxim no less applicable

I hold this to be a truth

I hold to the principle

I hope by this time we are all convinced

I hope for our own sakes

I hope I have expressed myself explicitly

I hope I may be allowed to intimate

I hope I shall not be told

I hope it is no disparagement

I hope most sincerely and truly

I hope none who hear me

I hope not to occupy more than a few minutes

I hope that I shall not be so unfortunate

I hope the day may be far distant

I hope the time may come again

I hope to be excused if

I hope to be forgiven if

I hope we may forget

I hope you will not accuse me

I imagine that no one will be disposed

I insist upon it

I intend to propose

I know from experience how

I know full well

I know I am treading on thin ice

I know it has been questioned

I know it is said

I know it will be said

I know many reasons why

I know not how else to express

I know not in what direction to look

I know not of my own knowledge

I know not where else to find

I know perfectly well

I know that it is impossible for me to

I know that this is the feeling

I know that what I may say is true

I know there are some who think

I know there is a theory among us

I know too well

I know very well the difference between

I know well it is not for me

I know well the sentiments

I know you are all impatient to hear

I know you will do all in your power

I know you will interpret what I say

I labor under a degree of prejudice

I lately heard it affirmed

I lay it down as a principle

I leave history to judge

I leave it to you

I leave the arduous task

I leave to others to speak

I long to speak a word or two

I look hopefully to

I look in vain

I look with encouragement

I look with inexpressible dread

I look with mingled hope and terror

I make my appeal to

I make no extravagant claim

I make this abrupt acknowledgment

I marvel that

I may add, speaking for my own part

I may be allowed to make one remark

I may be permitted to add

I may confess to you

I may safely appeal

I may say to you calmly

I may seem to have been diffuse

I may take as an instance

I may venture upon a review

I mean by this

I mean, moreover

I mean something more than that

I mention it to you to justify

I mention these facts because

I mention this, not by way of complaint

I might bring you another such case

I might deny that

I might enter into such detail

I might go further

I might go on indefinitely

I might go on to illustrate

I might of course point first

I might reasonably question the justice

I might try to explain

I might venture to claim

I might well have desired

I might well think

I must ask an abrupt question

I must be careful about what I say

I must be contented with

I must be excused if I say

I must bow in reverence

I must call your attention for a moment

I must conclude abruptly

I must confess that I became rather alarmed

I must consider this as

I must crave your indulgence

I must express to you again

I must fairly tell you

I must find some fault with

I must for want of time omit

I must here admit

I must lament

I must leave any detailed development

I must mention with praise

I must not allow myself to indulge

I must not for an instant be supposed

I must not overlook

I must now beg to ask

I must pause a moment to

I must proceed

I must qualify the statement

I must remind my hearers of

I must reply to some observations

I must return to the subject

I must say that I am one of those

I must speak plainly

I must suppose, however

I must take occasion to say

I must thank you once more

I must try to describe to you

I myself have boundless faith

I need not assure this brilliant company

I need not dwell

I need not enter into

I need not follow out the application

I need not, I am certain, assure you

I need not say how much I thank you

I need not show how inconsistent

I need not specially recommend to you

I need not wander far in search

I need only to observe

I need say nothing in praise

I need scarcely observe

I need to guard myself right here

I neither affirm nor deny

I next come to the implicit assumption

I note with particular pleasure

I notice it as affording an instance

I noticed incidentally the fact

I now address you on a question

I now come, sir, to the second head

I now have the pleasure of presenting to you

I now pass to the question of

I now proceed to inquire

I now reiterate

I object strongly to the use

I observe, then, in the first place

I only ask a favorable construction of

I only marvel

I only wish you to recognize

I open the all-important question

I ought to give an illustration

I own I can not help feeling

I particularly allude to

I pass on from that

I pass then to our second division

I pause for a moment to say

I pause to confess once more

I pay tribute to

I personally know that it is so

I pray God I may never

I predict that you will

I prefer a practical view

I presume I shall have to admit

I presume that I shall not be disbelieved

I proceed to another important phase

I profess

I propose briefly to glance at

I propose, therefore to consider

I protest I never had any doubt

I purposely have avoided

I question whether

I quite endorse what has been said

I rather look forward to a time

I readily grant

I really can not think it necessary to

I really do not know

I really thought that you would excuse me

I recall another historical fact

I recognize the high compliment conveyed

I recollect hearing a sagacious remark

I refer especially

I refuse to believe

I regard as an erroneous view

I regard it as a tribute

I regard it as a very great honor

I regret that I am not able to remember

I regret that it is not possible for me

I regret the time limits me

I regret this the less

I rejoice in an occasion like this

I rejoice that events have occurred

I rejoice to think I remark here

I remember a reference made

I remember an intimation

I remember full well

I remember the enjoyment with which

I remember to have heard

I repeat, I am not speaking

I repeat my statement in another form

I respectfully counsel

I respectfully submit

I rest my opinion on

I rise in behalf

I rise to express my disapprobation

I rise to thank you

I rise with some trepidation

I return, in conclusion, to

I return you my most grateful thanks

I said a little way back

I said it would be well

I said that I thought

I salute with profound reverence

I sanction with all my heart

I saw an ingenious argument the other day

I say frankly

I say in moderation

I say it is extremely important

I say it most confidently

I say no more of these things

I say not one syllable against

I say, then, my first point is

I say this is no disparagement of

I say this the more gladly

I say without fear of contradiction

I see around me

I see as clearly as any man possibly can

I see little hope of

I see no exception

I see no possibility of

I see no reason for doubting

I seem to hear you say

I seize upon this opportunity

I seriously desire

I set out with saying

I shall add a few words

I shall address myself to a single point

I shall ask you to look very closely

I shall be told

I shall best attain my object

I shall bestow a little attention upon

I shall certainly admit

I shall consider myself privileged

I shall desist from

I shall endeavor to be guided

I shall give it in the words of

I shall here briefly recite the

I shall here use the word to denote

I shall hope to interest you

I shall invite you to follow me

I shall just give the summary of

I shall never believe

I shall never cease to be grateful

I shall not acknowledge

I shall not attempt a detailed narrative

I shall not end without appealing

I shall not enlarge upon

I shall not force into the discussion

I shall not go so far as to say

I shall not hesitate to say something

I shall not tax your patience

I shall not undertake to prophesy

I shall not weary your patience

I shall now give you some instances

I shall now proceed to show

I shall often have to advert to

I shall pass by all this

I shall presently show

I shall proceed without further preface

I shall recur to certain questions

I shall say all this without entering into

I shall show that I am not

I shall speak first about

I shall speak with becoming frankness

I shall take a broader view of the subject

I shall take it for granted here

I shall therefore endeavor

I shall touch upon one or two questions

I shall waste no time in refuting

I shall with your sanction

I should be false to my own manhood

I should be surprised if

I should be the last man to deny

I should fail in my duty if

I should find it hard to discover

I should have forfeited my own self-respect

I should like at least to mention

I should like to emphasize

I should like to go a step farther

I should like to refer to two events

I should like to see that view answered

I should like to-day to examine briefly

I should much prefer

I should not be satisfied with myself

I should think it too absurd

I shrink from the contemplation

I shudder at the doctrine

I simply lay my finger on a fact

I simply pause here to ask

I sincerely regret the absence

I sincerely wish it were in my power

I solemnly declare

I sometimes hear a wish expressed

I sorrowfully call to mind

I speak forth my sentiment

I speak from no little personal observation

I speak of this to show

I speak the fact when I tell you

I speak the secret feeling of this company

I speak what I know when I say

I speak wholly without authority

I speak with feeling upon this point

I speak with some degree of encouragement

I speak with the utmost sincerity

I speak within the hearing of

I stand in awed amazement before

I stand in the midst of men

I still view with respect

I submit it to every candid mind

I submit that in such a case

I submit that it is high time

I submit this proposition

I summon you to do your share

I suppose it is right to answer

I suppose it to be entirely true

I suppose most men will recollect

I suppose that everyone who listens to me

I suppose there is no one here

I suppose we are all of one opinion

I suspect that is why we so often

I sympathize most heartily

I take a broader and bolder position

I take it for granted

I take leave to say

I take one picture as an illustration

I take pleasure in saying

I take the liberty of observing

I take this instance at random

I take two views of

I tell him in reply

I tell you, gentlemen

I tender my thanks to you

I thank you for having allowed me

I thank you for the appreciative tone

I thank you for the honor

I thank you for your most generous greeting

I thank you for your thoughtful courtesy

I thank you from the bottom of my heart

I thank you very gratefully

I thank you very sincerely for the honor

I think I am correct in saying

I think I am not the first to utter

I think I can claim a purpose

I think I can sincerely declare

I think I have a right to look upon

I think I have rightly spoken

I think I might safely say

I think I need not say more

I think it is not too much to say

I think it is quite right

I think it may be necessary to consider

I think it might be said with safety

I think it my duty to

I think it observable

I think it probable

I think it will astonish you

I think it will be granted

I think no Wise man can be indifferent

I think, on the contrary

I think something may be said in favor of

I think that all will agree

I think that I can explain

I think that I can venture to say

I think that, in these last years

I think that none of us will deny

I think there is no better evidence

I think there is no call on me to listen

I think we are justified

I think we can hardly hope

I think we may all easily see

I think we may ask in reply

I think we may safely conclude

I think we may say, therefore

I think we may well be proud of

I think we may well congratulate each other

I think we must draw a distinction

I think we need neither doubt nor fear

I think we ought to recur a moment to

I think we shall all recognize

I think we should do well to call to mind

I think we take too narrow a view

I think when we look back upon

I think you may well rejoice in

I think you will all agree

I think you will pardon my saying

I think you will see

I thus explicitly reply

I tremble at the task

I tremble to think

I trust I may be indulged

I trust it is not presumptuous

I trust that as the years roll on

I trust that I shall have the indulgence

I trust that this will not be regarded as

I turn, gentlemen, to the case

I use the word advisedly

I use the word in the sense

I use very plain language

I utter this word with the deepest affection

I value very much the honor

I venture to ask permission

I venture to say

I verily believe

I very confidently submit

I view that prospect with the greatest misgiving

I want to bespeak your attention

I want to know the character

I want to make some simple applications

I want to say just a few words

I want to say one word more

I want to say to you seriously

I want to think with you

I warn and exhort you

I was astonished to learn

I was constantly watchful to

I was exceedingly interested

I was honored with the acquaintance

I was lost in admiration

I was not slow to accept and believe

I was not without some anxiety

I was overwhelmed

I was sincerely astonished

I was very much interested

I was very much thrilled

I well recollect the time

I well remember an occasion

I will accept the general proposition

I will add the memorable words

I will ask the indulgence

I will ask you to accompany me

I will ask you to bear witness

I will dwell a little longer

I will endeavor in a brief way

I will endeavor to illustrate

I will endeavor to show you

I will enlarge no further

I will even express a hope at the outset

I will even go further and say

I will first call your attention to

I will give one more illustration

I will illustrate this point by

I will merely mention

I will neither affirm nor deny

I will not allude

I will not argue this

I will not attempt to note

I will not be content until

I will not condescend to

I will not enumerate at present

I will not pause to maintain

I will not positively say

I will not pretend to inquire into

I will not quarrel with

I will not relinquish the confidence

I will not repeat the arguments here

I will not try to gauge

I will now consider with you

I will now leave this question

I will now take an instance

I will only speak to one point

I will only sum up my evidence

I will only take an occasion to express

I will only venture to remind you

I will point out to your attention

I will say at once

I will speak but a word or two more

I will speak plainly

I will state with perfect distinctness

I will suppose the objection to be

I will take one more instance

I will take the precaution to add

I will tell you what I think of

I will try to make the thing intelligible

I will venture a single remark

I will venture to add

I will venture to express the hope

I will yield the whole question

I willingly admit

I wish also to declare positively

I wish at the outset

I wish emphatically to reaffirm

I wish I had the time and the power

I wish it first observed

I wish rather to call your attention

I wish, sir, that justice might be done

I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe

I wish to be allowed to enforce in detail

I wish to begin my statement

I wish to confine what I have to say

I wish to do full justice to

I wish to draw your attention

I wish to express my profound gratification

I wish to give these arguments their full weight

I wish to know whether

I wish to offer a few words relative to

I wish to remind you in how large a degree

I wish to say a word or two

I wish to state all this as a matter of fact

I wish you success and happiness

I wish you to observe

I would also gratefully acknowledge

I would as soon believe

I would desire to speak simply and directly

I would enter a protest

I would further point out to you

I would have you understand

I would infinitely rather

I would like to say one word just here

I would not be understood as belittling

I would not dwell upon that matter if

I would not push the suggestion so far

I would now gladly lay before you

I would rather a thousand times

I would recommend to your consideration

I would suggest first of all

I would that my voice could reach the ear

I would urge and entreat you

I would urge upon you

I would venture to point out

I yielded to the earnest solicitations

If any man be so persuaded

If anyone could conceive

If anyone is so dim of vision

If any other answer be made

If at first view this should seem

If, however, you determine to

If I am asked for the proof

If I am wrong

If I can carry you with me

If I can succeed in describing

If I could find words

If I have done no more than view the facts

If I have in any way deserved

If I may be allowed a little criticism

If I may be allowed modestly to suggest

If I may be allowed to refer

If I may reverently say so

If I may say so without presumption

If I may so speak

If I may take for granted

If I may venture to say anything

If I mistake not the sentiment

If I recollect aright

If I understand the matter at all

If I venture a few remarks

If I were asked

If I were to act upon my conviction

If I were to recapitulate

If I wished to prove my contention

If, in consequence we find it necessary

If in the glow of conscious pride

If in the years of the future

If it be difficult to appreciate

If it be so

If it be true

If it is contended

If it means anything, it means this

If more were needed to illustrate.

If my opinions are true

If on the contrary, we all foresee

If, on the other hand, I say

If one seeks to measure

If only we go deep enough

If still you have further doubt

If the bare facts were studied

If the experience of the world is worth anything

If, then, I am asked

If, then, I should here rest my cause

If there be any among us

If there be one lesson more than another

If this be so

If this seems doubtful to anyone

If, unhappily, the day should ever come

If we accept at all the argument

If we are not blind to

If we are rightly informed

If we are to reason on the fact

If we cast our glance back

If we embark upon a career

If we had the whole case before us

If we isolate ourselves

If we may trust to experience

If we pursue a different course

If we pursue our inquiries through

If we sincerely desire

If we survey

If we would not be beguiled

If what has been said is true

If you remain silent

If you seek the real meaning of

If you think for a moment

If you want to look

If you were asked to point out

If you will allow me to prophesy

If you will forgive me the expression

If you wish for a more interesting example

If you wish to get at the bottom of facts

If you would see the most conclusive proof

If your view is right

In a significant paragraph

In a wider sense

In a word, gentlemen

In a word, I conceive

In actual life, I suspect

In addition to these arguments

In addressing myself to the question

In addressing you I feel

In agreement with this obvious conclusion

In all ages of the world

In all or any of these views

In all times and places

In an unguarded moment

In answering the inquiry

In any view of the case

In closing my speech, I ask each of you

In conclusion, let me say

In conclusion, may I repeat

In consequence it becomes a necessity

In contemplating the causes

In days to come

In examining this part of the subject

In fine, it is no extravagance to say

In former ages and generations

In further illustration

In further proof of my assertion

In illustration of what I have said

In like manner are to be explained

In like manner I would advise

In listening to the kind words

In looking about me

In many instances

In meeting this difficulty, I will not urge

In most cases I hold

In my estimation

In my humble opinion

In my view

In offering to you these counsels

In one other respect

In one point I wish no one to mistake me

In one sense this is undoubtedly true

In order to appreciate the force of

In order to complete the proof

In order to do justice to the question

In order to prove plainly and intelligibly

In order to realize adequately

In other words

In our estimate of the past

In point of fact

In precisely the same way

In pursuance of these views

In pursuing the great objects

In regard to

In rising to return my sincere thanks

In saying all of this, I do not forget

In saying this, I am not disposed to deny

In short, I say

In solving this difficulty

In something of a parallel way

In spite of the fact

In such cases, strictly speaking

In support of this assertion

In that matchless epitome

In that mood of high hope

In the anomalies of fortune

In the course of these remarks

In the existing circumstances

In the first place, therefore, I consider

In the first place we see

In the first place, we should be all agreed

In the fullest sense

In the fullness of time

In the last suggestion

In the meantime I will commend to you

In the next place, be assured

In the presence of this vast assembly

In the present situation

In the progress of events

In the remarks I have made

In the same manner I rely

In the second place it is quite clear

In the suggestion I have made

In the very brief space at our disposal

In these extraordinary circumstances

In these sentiments I agree

In this brief survey

In this connection, I may be permitted to refer

In this connection I remind myself

In this necessarily brief and imperfect review

In this rapid and slight enumeration

In this respect

In this sense only

In this there is no contradiction

In very many instances

In very truth

In view of these reflections

In what has now been said

In what I have now further to say

In widening our view

Indeed, can anyone tell me

Indeed, I am not convinced

Indeed, I can not do better

Indeed, I have heard it whispered

Indeed, I may fairly say

Indeed, it will generally be found

Indeed we know

Instances abound

Is it logically consistent

Is it not legitimate to recognize

Is it not marvelous

Is it not obvious

Is it not quite possible

Is it not, then, preposterous

Is it not universally recognized

Is it not wise to argue

Is it possible, can it be believed

Is it, then, any wonder

Is not that the common sentiment

Is there any evidence here

Is there any language of reproach

Is there any possibility of mistaking

Is there any reason in the world

It affords me gratification

It also pleases me very much

It amounts to this

It appears from what has been said

It appears to me, on the contrary

It can rightly be said

It certainly follows, then

It comes to this

It could not be otherwise

It does not necessarily follow

It exhibits a state of mind

It follows as a matter of course

It follows inevitably

It gives us an exalted conception

It grieves me to relate

It hardly fits the character

It has at all times been a just reproach

It has been a very great pleasure for me

It has been generally assumed

It has been justly objected

It has been my privilege

It has been suggested fancifully

It has been well said

It has ever been my ambition

It has struck me very forcibly

It is a circumstance of happy augury

It is a common error

It is a curious trait

It is a fact well known

It is a falsehood to say

It is a familiar charge against

It is a good augury of success

It is a great pleasure to me

It is a living truth

It is a matter of absorbing interest

It is a matter of amusement

It is a matter of fact

It is a matter of just pride

It is a melancholy story

It is a memory I cherish

It is a mischievous notion

It is a mistake to suppose

It is a most extraordinary thing

It is a most pertinent question

It is a noble thing

It is a peculiar pleasure to me

It is a perversion of terms

It is a pleasing peculiarity

It is a popular idea

It is a rare privilege

It is a recognized principle

It is a remarkable and striking fact

It is a strange fact

It is a sure sign

It is a theme too familiar

It is a thing commonly said

It is a touching reflection

It is a true saying

It is a very significant fact

It is a vision which still inspires us

It is a wholesome symptom

It is, all things considered, a fact

It is all very fine to think

It is all very well to say

It is almost proverbial

It is also possible

It is also probably true

It is always pleasant to respond

It is amazing how little

It is an easy matter

It is an egregious mistake

It is an established rule

It is an incredible thing

It is an interesting fact

It is an unforgivable offense

It is an unquestionable truth

It is appropriate that we should celebrate

It is asserted

It is assumed as an axiom

It is at once inconsistent

It is but fair to say

It is but too true

It is by no means my design

It is certainly especially pleasant

It is certainly remarkable

It is common in these days to lament

It is commonly assumed

It is comparatively easy

It is curious sophistry

It is curious to observe

It is desirable for us

It is difficult for me to respond fitly

It is difficult to avoid saying

It is difficult to describe

It is difficult to overstate

It is difficult to put a limit

It is difficult to surmise

It is doubtful whether

It is easy enough to add

It is easy to instance cases

It is easy to understand

It is eminently proper

It is every man's duty to think

It is evident that the answer to this

It is evidently supposed by many people

It is exceedingly gratifying to hear

It is exceedingly unfortunate

It is fair that you should hear

It is fair to suppose

It is far from me to desire

It is fatal to suppose

It is fitting

It is for me to relate

It is for others to illustrate

It is for this reason

It is for us to ask

It is greatly assumed

It is gratifying to have the honor

It is hardly for me

It is hardly necessary to pass judgment

It is idle to think of

It is immaterial whether

It is impossible to avoid saying

It is in every way appropriate

It is in the highest degree worthy

It is in this characteristic

It is in vain

It is in your power to give

It is indeed a strange doctrine

It is indeed not a little remarkable

It is indeed true

It is indeed very clear

It is indispensable to have

It is interesting and suggestive

It is interesting to know

It is just so far true

It is likewise necessary

It is made evident

It is manifest

It is manifestly absurd to say

It is merely common sense to say

It is more than probable

It is my agreeable duty

It is my belief

It is my earnest wish

It is my grateful duty to address you

It is my hope

It is my present purpose

It is natural to ask the question

It is necessary to refer

It is necessary to take some notice

It is needful to a complete understanding

It is needless before this audience to repeat

It is no doubt true

It is no exaggeration to say

It is no part of my business

It is no significant thing

It is no small indication

It is no wonder

It is not a practical question

It is not altogether satisfactory

It is not an unknown occurrence

It is not by any means

It is not difficult to comprehend

It is not difficult to discern

It is not easy for me to find words

It is not enough to say

It is not entirely clear to me

It is not evident

It is not for me on this occasion

It is not given to many men

It is not likely that any of you

It is not logical to say

It is not my intention to enter into

It is not my purpose to discuss

It is not necessarily true

It is not necessary for me even to sketch

It is not necessary for our purpose

It is not often in these modern days

It is not ours to pronounce

It is not out of place to remind you

It is not possible to recount

It is not quite clear

It is not to me so very surprising

It is not too much to say

It is not unknown to you

It is not within the scope of this address

It is now high time for me

It is now perfectly plain

It is observable enough

It is obvious

It is of course difficult

It is of great importance to show

It is of no moment

It is of very little importance

It is often remarked

It is on these grounds

It is one of the burning questions of the day

It is one of the most natural visions

It is one of the most significant things

It is one of the queerest freaks of fate

It is only a few short years since

It is only just to say

It is our duty to examine

It is ours to bear witness

It is owing to this truth

It is peculiarly befitting at this time

It is perfectly apparent

It is pitiable to reflect

It is pleasant to meet this brilliant company

It is rather a pleasant coincidence

It is rather an arduous task

It is rather startling

It is related

It is ridiculous to say

It is said, and I think said truly

It is said to be impossible

It is satisfactory to notice

It is scarcely necessary to insist

It is scarcely questioned

It is self-evident

It is sometimes hard to determine

It is still an open question

It is still more surprising

It is substantially true

It is surely necessary for me

It is the clear duty of

It is the doctrine of

It is the fashion to extol

It is the universal testimony

It is therefore evident

It is therefore necessary

It is this which lies at the foundation

It is to be expected

It is to be remembered

It is to me a very sincere satisfaction

It is told traditionally

It is too plain to be argued

It is true

It is unnecessary for me to remind you

It is upon this line of reasoning

It is very common to confuse

It is very doubtful whether

It is very interesting and pleasant

It is well known

It is with great pleasure

It is with pity unspeakable

It is within the memory of men now living

It is worth while to notice

It may appear absurd

It may at first sight seem strange

It may be added

It may be conjectured

It may be imagined

It may be plausibly objected

It may be rightly said

It may be useful to trace

It may be worth your while to keep in view

It may indeed be unavoidable

It may not be altogether certain

It may not be uninteresting to any of you

It may or may not be true

It may, perhaps, seem wonderful

It may seem a little strange

It may still more probably be said

It must be a cause of delight

It must be borne in mind

It must be the verdict of history

It must create astonishment

It must doubtless be admitted

It must ever be recollected

It must never be forgotten

It must not be supposed

It must seem to every thoughtful man

It needs scarcely be said

It now becomes my pride and privilege

It only remains now to speak

It ought to animate us

It proves a great deal

It remains only to speak briefly

It remains that I inform you of

It remains that I should say a few words

It reminds me of an anecdote

It reminds one of the compliment

It requires no effort of imagination

It scarcely seems to be in keeping

It seems almost desperate to think of

It seems almost incredible

It seems now to be generally admitted

It seems strange to be told

It seems then that on the whole

It seems to me a striking circumstance

It seems to me idle to ask

It seems to me singularly appropriate

It seems to me the primary foundation

It seems to me unphilosophical

It should always be borne in mind

It should be remembered

It so happens

It sometimes seems to me

It still remains to be observed

It strikes me with wonder

It suggests at the outset

It summons our imagination

It surely is not too much to expect

It therefore astonishes me

It used to be a reproach

It was a brilliant answer

It was a fine and delicate rebuke

It was a fit and beautiful circumstance

It was a propitious circumstance

It was certainly a gracious act

It was in the full understanding

It was my good fortune

It was not to be expected

It was said by one who ought to know

It was, therefore, inevitable

It was under these circumstances

It will appeal to

It will appear from what has been said

It will be asked me how

It will be easy to say too much

It will be easy to trace the influence

It will be evident to you

It will be idle to imply

It will be interesting to trace

It will be just as reasonable to say

It will be rather to our advantage

It will be recollected

It will be seen at a glance

It will be well and wise

It will carry out my meaning more fully

It will, I suppose, be denied

It will not be expected from me

It will not be safe

It will not do for a man to say

It will not, I trust, be concluded

It will not surely be objected

It will not take many words to sum up

It will thus be seen

It would be a misfortune

It would be a proud distinction

It would be a very remarkable fact

It would be absurd to pretend

It would be an inexcusable omission

It would be idle for me

It would be imprudent in me

It would be invidious for me

It would be natural on such an occasion

It would be no less impracticable

It would be out of place here

It would be preposterous to say

It would be presumptuous in me

It would be the height of absurdity

It would be unfair to praise

It would be unjust to deny

It would be well for us to reflect

It would indeed be unworthy

It would seem perhaps most fitting


J

Just the reverse is true


L

Language is inadequate to voice my appreciation

Lastly, I do not understand

Lastly, it can not be denied

Less than this could not be said

Lest I should be accused of quibbling

Let all of us labor in this work

Let anyone imagine to himself

Let anyone who doubts

Let everyone consider

Let it be clearly understood, I repeat it

Let it be remembered

Let it not be objected

Let it not be supposed that I impute

Let me add another thing

Let me add my final word

Let me add one other hint

Let me also say a word in regard

Let me answer these questions

Let me ask you to imagine

Let me ask your leave to propose

Let me be allowed to devote a few words

Let me call attention to another fact

Let me commend to you

Let me direct your attention now to

Let me entreat you to examine

Let me give one more instance

Let me give one parting word

Let me give you an illustration

Let me here make one remark

Let me here say

Let me hope that I have said enough

Let me illustrate again

Let me make myself distinctly understood

Let me make use of an illustration

Let me not be thought offensive

Let me now conclude with

Let me once more urge upon you

Let me protest against the manner

Let me quite temperately defend

Let me rather make the supposition

Let me say a practical word

Let me simply declare

Let me tell you an interesting reminiscence

Let me thank you once more

Let me urge you earnestly

Let no man congratulate himself

Let our conception be enlarged

Let our object be

Let that question be answered by

Let the facts be granted

Let these instances suffice

Let this be the record made

Let this inspire us with abhorrence of

Let us approach the subject from another side

Let us attempt a survey

Let us be perfectly just

Let us be quite practical

Let us bear perpetually in mind

Let us begin at the beginning

Let us begin by examining

Let us briefly review

Let us brush aside once for all

Let us cherish

Let us confirm our opinion

Let us consider for a moment

Let us devote ourselves

Let us discard all prejudice

Let us do all we can

Let us draw an illustration

Let us endeavor to understand

Let us enumerate

Let us figure to ourselves

Let us for the moment put aside

Let us get a clear understanding

Let us heed the voice

Let us hope and believe

Let us hope that future generations

Let us imitate

Let us inquire also

Let us labor and pray

Let us likewise remember

Let us look briefly at a few particulars

Let us look nearer home

Let us not be fearful

Let us not be misled

Let us not be misunderstood

Let us not flatter ourselves

Let us not for a moment forget

Let us not limit our view

Let us now apply the views presented

Let us now consider the characteristics

Let us now see the results

Let us now turn our consideration

Let us observe this analogy

Let us pass on to another fact

Let us pause a moment

Let us push the inquiry yet further

Let us rather listen to

Let us reflect how vain

Let us remember this

Let us remind ourselves

Let us resolve

Let us scrutinize the facts

Let us suppose, for argument's sake

Let us suppose the case to be

Let us take, for instance

Let us, then, be assured

Let us, then, be worthy of

Let us, therefore, say once for all

Let us try to form a mental picture

Let us turn to the contemplation of

Let your imagination realize

Like all citizens of high ideals

Likely enough

Little wonder therefore

Long have I been convinced

Look at it in another way

Look at some of these questions

Look at the situation


M

Mainly, I believe

Making allowances for differences of opinion

Many of us have had the good fortune

Many of you, perhaps, recollect

May I ask you to believe

May I not speak here

May I try to show that every effort

May I venture to suggest

May it not also be advanced

May the day come quickly

Meantime it is encouraging to think

Meanwhile let us freely recognize

Men are in the habit of saying

Men are telling us nowadays

Men everywhere testify

More and more it is felt

More than once have I had to express

More than this need not be said

Moreover, I have insisted

Moreover, I would counsel you

Moreover, when we pass judgment

Much has been said and written about

My appreciation has been quickened

My belief, therefore, is

My duty is to endeavor to show

My experience tells me

My first duty is to express to you

My friends, do you really believe

My friends, I propose

My heart tells me

My idea, therefore, is

My last criticism upon

My mind is not moved by

My mind most perfectly acquiesces

My next objection is

My own private opinion is

My present business is

My regret is intensified by the thought


N

Nay, I boldly say

Nay, it will be a relief to my mind

Nay, there is a general feeling

Need I say that I mean

Neither should you deceive

Never before have I so strongly felt

Never can I cease to feel

Never did there devolve

Never for a moment believe

Never have I felt so forcibly

Never was a weaker defense attempted

Never was there a greater mistake

Never was there an instance

Nevertheless we can admit

Next, from what has been said it is plain

Next, I consider

Next, it will be denied

No argument can overwhelm a fact

No defense is to be found

No distinct test can be named

No doubt, in the first instance

No doubt there are many questions

No doubt to most of us

No finer sentence has come down to us

No greater service could be rendered

No longer do we believe

No man regrets more than I do

No one can feel this more strongly

No one can, I think, pretend

No one can see the end

No one here, I am sure

No one, I suppose, would say

No one, I think, can fail to observe

No one, I think, will dispute the statement

No one need to exaggerate

No one will accuse me

No true man ever believes

None can have failed to observe

Nor am I disparaging or discouraging

Nor can I forget either

Nor can it justly be said

Nor can we afford to waste time

Nor can we forget how long

Nor can we now ask

Nor do I believe

Nor do I doubt

Nor do I pretend

Nor do I think there can be found

Nor does it matter much

Nor has there been wanting

Nor indeed am I supposing

Nor is it a fair objection

Nor is it probable

Nor is this all

Nor let me forget to add here

Nor must I be understood as saying

Nor must it be forgotten

Nor need we fear to speak

Nor should any attempt be made

Nor will history fail to record

Nor will I enlarge on the matter

Not at all

Not only so

Not that I quarrel with

Nothing but the deepest sense

Nothing can be further from the truth

Nothing could be clearer

Nothing could be more striking

Nothing is more common in the world

Nothing that you can do

Notwithstanding all that has been said

Notwithstanding all this, I hold

Now, bear with me when I say

Now comes the question

Now, comparing these instances together

Now, from these instances it is plain

Now, having spoken of

Now, I admit

Now, I am far from denying

Now, I am far from undervaluing

Now, I am justified in calling this

Now, I am obliged to say

Now, I do not wish you to believe

Now, I have a closing sentence or two

Now, I pass on to consider

Now, I shall not occupy your time

Now, I understand the argument

Now, I will undertake to say

Now, I wish to call your attention

Now, if you will clearly understand

Now, is there any ground or basis for

Now, it is an undoubted fact

Now, it is evident

Now, it is not at all strange

Now, it is unquestioned

Now, let me speak with the greatest care

Now, let me stop a moment

Now, let us consider

Now, observe, my drift

Now, sir, I am truly horrified

Now, the answer we should give

Now, the question here at issue

Now, the world will say

Now, there is a close alliance between

Now, this is precisely the danger

Now, this is to some extent

Now, understand me definitely

Now, we do not maintain

Now, we will inquire

Now, what I want you to realize

Now, with regard to

Now, you will allow me to state

Now, you will understand from this


O

Observe again

Occasionally you ought to read

Of course I am aware

Of course I am putting an impossible case

Of course I can not be taken to mean

Of course I do not maintain

Of course I do not stop here

Of course I would not allow

Of course much may be said

Of course these remarks hold good

Of course we may, if we please

Of course you will sympathize

Of one thing, however, I am certain

Of this briefly

Of this statement I will only say

Of this truth I shall convince you by

On a review of the whole subject

On occasions of this kind

On such a day as this

On the contrary, I am assuming

On the occasion to which I refer

On the other hand, it is clear

On the whole, then, I observe

On this auspicious occasion

On this point I do not mean to dwell

On this subject you need not suspect

Once again, there are those

Once more I emphasize

Once more let me try to put into words

One additional remark

One almost wishes

One can not decline to note

One concluding remark has to be made

One fact is clear and indisputable

One further word

One important topic remains

One is fairly tempted to wish

One lesson history may be said to repeat

One might be challenged to produce

One of the ancients said

One of the most commonly known

One of the most extraordinary incidents

One of the things I recollect with most pride

One of these signs is the fact

One or two points are made clear

One other circumstance

One other remark suggests itself

One remark I will make

One thing more will complete this question

One thing which always impressed me

One very striking tendency

One word in courtesy I must say

One word more in a serious vein

One would naturally suppose

Only so much do I know

Opinions are divided as to whether

Or to come nearer home

Or to take but one other example

Ordinarily speaking, such deductions

Others may hold other opinions

Ought we not to think

Our thoughts wander back

Over and above all this


P

Pardon me if

Perhaps another reason why

Perhaps, however, in speaking to you

Perhaps, however, some among you will be

Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate

Perhaps I ought to say

Perhaps it may be doubted

Perhaps, sir, I am mistaken in

Permit me frankly to say

Permit me to add another circumstance

Permit me to bring home to you

Personally, I am far too firm a believer

Pray, sir, let me say


R

Read but your history aright

Recollect, sir

Reflections such as these

Rely upon it

Remember, I do not seek to

Remembering some past occurrences

Returning, then, to the consideration


S

Seriously, then, do I beg you

Shall I tell you

Shall we complain

Should there be objection, I answer

Since, then, it is provided

Since, then, this is the case

Sir, with all my heart, I respond

So accustomed are we

So at least it seems to me

So far as I know

So far as my observation and experience goes

So far in general

So I say to you

So it comes to pass

So long as we continue to love truth and duty

So men are asking

So much at first sight

So much on this subject

So that I may venture to say

So that if you were persuaded

So then ought we also

So, to add one other example

So, too, I may go on to speak

So when I hear people say

Some have insisted

Some of you can recall the time

Some of you may think this visionary

Some of you will remember

Some one will perhaps object

Some prejudice is attached

Some writer has said

Sometimes I venture to think

Sometimes it may happen

Speaking in this place

Startling as this may appear to you

Stating only the truth, I affirm

Still another encouraging fact

Still further

Still I can not part from my subject

Still I have generally found

Still I imagine you would consider it

Still I know what answer I can make to

Still it may with justice be said

Still one thing more

Still we ought to be grateful

Strange as it may seem

Strictly in confidence, I do not think

Strictly speaking, there is no such thing

Such a doctrine is essentially superficial

Such are the rather tolerant ideas

Such considerations as these

Such, I believe, would be the consequences

Such illustrations are not frequent

Such, in brief, is the story

Such is steadfastly my opinion

Such is the deep prejudice now existing

Such is the intellectual view we take

Such is the lesson which I am taught

Such is the progress

Such is the truth

Such, sir, I conceive to be

Such, then, is the true idea

Such, too, is the characteristic of

Suffer me to point out

Suffice it to say here

Summing up what I have said

Suppose we turn our eyes to

Surely I do not misinterpret

Surely it is a paradox

Surely it is not too much for me to say


T

Take another instance

Take one of the most recent cases

Take the simple fact

Take this example

Taking a broader view

Taking the facts by themselves

That is a further point

That is a natural boast

That is a pure assumption

That is all that it seems necessary to me

That is all very good

That is far from my thoughts

That is final and conclusive

That is the lesson of history

That is the question of questions

That you may conceive the force of

The answer is easy to find

The answer is ready

The belief is born of the wish

The broad principle which I would lay down

The circumstances under which we meet

The climax of my purpose in this address

The common consent of civilized mankind

The conclusion is irresistible

The confusing assertion is sometimes made

The day is at hand

The decided objection is raised

The doctrine I am combating

The doctrine is admirable

The effect too often is

The evolution of events has brought

The fact has made a deep impression on me

The fact has often been insisted

The fact to be particularly noted

The facts are clear and unequivocal

The facts may be strung together

The first business of every man

The first counsel I would offer

The first great fact to remember is

The first point to be ascertained

The first practical thought is

The first remarkable instance was

The first thing I wish to note

The first thing that we have to consider

The future historian will, no doubt

The generous feeling that has promoted you

The great mass of the people

The hour is at hand

The illustration is analogous

The important thing is

The instance I shall choose

The irresistible tendency of

The kindness with which I have been received

The last and distinguishing feature is

The latest inclination I have seen

The lesson which we should take most to heart

The main cause of all this

The more you examine this matter

The most concise tribute paid

The most reasonable anticipation

The most remarkable step forward

The most striking characteristic

The most sublime instance that I know

The next point is

The next question to be considered is

The next thing I consider indispensable

The occasion that calls us together

The one central difference between

The only course that remains open

The only plea to be offered

The other day I observed

The paramount consideration is

The perils that beset us here

The pleasing duty is assigned me

The point I have urged upon you is

The point I wish a little further to speak of

The point to which I shall call your attention

The popular notion is

The practical inference from all this

The presence of this brilliant assemblage

The pressing question is

The prevalent opinion, no doubt

The proof of this statement is to be found

The question is deeply involved

The question, then, recurs

The remedy I believe to be

The result, I fancy, has been

The result of the whole

The rule will always hold good

The sacred voice of inspiration

The same is true in respect of

The scene all comes back

The sentiment to which I am to respond

The sentiment which you have expressed

The simple rule and test

The simple truth is

The soundness of this doctrine depends

The strongest proof I have

The subject of the evening's address

The subject which has been assigned to me

The task has been placed in my hands

The testimony of history is

The theory seems at first sight

The thought with which I shall close

The time has manifestly now arrived

The time is not far distant

The time is now come for me

The times are full of signs and warnings

The toast I am about to propose to you

The vain wish has sometimes been indulged

The view I have been enforcing

The view is more misleading

The warmth and kindness of your reception

The welcome that has been extended to me

The whole story of civilization

Then again, in corroboration

Then again, when men say

Then take the other side of the argument

Then the question arises

Then there is another story

Then, too, it must be remembered

There are certain old truths

There are few spectacles

There are hopeful signs of

There are, I believe, many who think

There are, indeed, exceptions

There are, indeed, persons who profess

There are many educated and intelligent people

There are people in every community

There are several reasons why

There are some slight modifications

There are some who are fond of looking at

There are some who have an idea

There are those of us who can remember

There are those who wish

There are two conflicting theories

There can be but one answer

There can be no doubt

There has been a great deal of discussion lately

There has been no period of time

There have been differences of opinion

There is a characteristic saying

There is a class of person

There is a common saying

There is a conviction

There is a degree of evidence

There is a genuine grief

There is a great deal of rash talking

There is a growing disposition

There is a large class of thinkers

There is a lesson of profound interest

There is a more important question

There is a most serious lesson

There is a multitude of facts

There is a question of vital importance

There is a very common tendency

There is a vital difference of opinion

There is an analogy in this respect

There is an ancient story to the effect

There is an eternal controversy

There is another class of men

There is another factor

There is another object equally important

There is another point of view

There is another remarkable analogy

There is another sense in which

There is, at any rate, to be said

There is but one consideration

There is certainly no reason

There is hardly any limit

There is, however, another opinion

There is, however, one caution

There is little truth in

There is no field of human activity

There is no good reason

There is no justification for

There is no mistaking the purpose

There is no more insidious peril

There is no more striking exemplification

There is no occasion to exaggerate

There is no page of history

There is no sense in saying

There is no worse perversion

There is not a shadow of evidence

There is nothing more repulsive

There is nothing overstated in this description

There is nothing to show

There is one story which it is said

There is only one sense in which

There is some difference of opinion

There is something strangely interesting

There is yet another distinction

There is yet one other remark

There ought certainly to be

There was but one alternative

There was one remarkable incident

There will always be a number of men

There will be no difficulty

There yet remains

Therefore, there is no possibility of a doubt

Therein lies your responsibility

These alone would not be sufficient

These are enough to refute the opinion

These are general counsels

These are generalizations

These are my reasons for

These are points for consideration

These considerations have great weight with me

These exceptions do not hold in the case of

These ideas naturally present themselves

These instances are far from common

These instances are indications

These last words lead me to say

These objections only go to show

These questions I shall examine

These various partial views

They mistake the intelligence

They would persuade you to

Think for a moment

Think of the cool disregard

This absurdity arises

This appeal to the common sense

This argument is especially cogent

This, at least, is sure

This being the case

This being true

This being undeniable, it is plain

This being understood, I ask

This brings me to a single remark

This brings us to a subject

This episode goes to prove

This fact was soon made manifest

This from the nature of the case

This I conceive to be the business

This I consider to be my own case

This I have told you

This is a general statement

This is a very one-sided conception

This is a very serious situation

This is an astonishing announcement

This is conceded by

This is contrary to all argument

This is doubtless the truth

This is especially the case

This is essentially an age of

This is in the main just

This is like saying

This is not all

This is not the main point of objection

This is not the occasion or the place

This is obvious

This is on the whole reasonable

This is only another illustration of

This is owing in great measure to

This is precisely what we ought to do

This is said in no spirit of

This is suggested to us

This is the design and intention

This is the great fact

This is the main point on which the inquiry turns

This is the meaning of

This is the obvious answer

This is the point I want to impress upon you

This is the point of view

This is the position of our minds

This is the radical question

This is the sentiment of mankind

This is the starting-point

This is the sum

This is to be found in the fact

This is what I am led to say

This is what may be objected

This is why I take the liberty

This language is plain

This leads me to the question

This leads us to inquire

This may be said without prejudice

This might be illustrated at length

This much is certain

This sentiment was well-nigh universal

This, surely, is the conclusion

This, then, is the answer

This, then, is the drift of my illustration

This, then, is what I mean by saying

This will be evident at once

This you can not deny

Those who have watched the tendencies

Thus a great deal may be done

Thus analogy suggests

Thus far, I willingly admit

Thus I am led on to another remark

Thus if you look into

Thus instances occur now and then

Thus it comes to pass

Thus my imagination tells me

Thus much, however, I may say

Thus much I may be allowed to say

Thus much may be sufficient to recall

Thus we see

Time would not permit me

To a man of the highest public spirit

To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood

To be more explicit

To be sure, we sometimes hear

To bring the matter nearer home

To convince them of this

To feel the true force of this argument

To illustrate

To make my story quite complete

To me, however, it would appear

To my way of conceiving such matters

To prevent misapprehension

To some it may sound like a paradox

To sum up all that has been said

To sum up in one word

To take a very different instance

To the conclusion thus drawn

To the enormous majority of persons

To these general considerations

To this I answer

To this it will be replied

To what other cause can you ascribe

To-day, as never before

Treading close upon the heels

Tried by this standard

True it is

True, there are difficulties

Truly it is a subject for astonishment

Two things are made very clear


U

Under all the circumstances

Under these favoring conditions

Under this head

Undoubtedly we may find

Unfortunately it is a truth

Unless I could be sure

Up to this moment I have stated


V

Very strange is this indeed


W

We all agree as to

We all feel the force of the maxim

We all in equal sincerity profess

We almost shudder when we see

We are accustomed to lay stress upon

We are all familiar with

We are approaching an era

We are apt to forget

We are assembled here to-day

We are beginning to realize

We are bound to give heed

We are constantly being told

We are fulfilling what I believe to be

We are in the habit of saying

We are met to-night

We are not able to prove

We are not disinterested

We are quite unable to speculate

We are told emphatically

We are tolerably certain

We believe with a sincere belief

We can but pause to contemplate

We can imagine the amazement of

We can not but be struck with

We can not escape the truth

We can not have this too deeply fixed

We can not too highly honor the temper of

We can not wonder

We can only applaud the sentiment

We can only bow with awe

We can presume

We can remember with pride

We can see to some extent

We continually hear nowadays

We deeply appreciate the circumstances of

We do not quarrel with those

We do not question the reality

We do well to recall

We easily persuade ourselves

We feel keenly about such things

We grope blindly along

We have a firm assurance

We have a right to claim

We have an overpowering sense

We have been accustomed to

We have been told by more than one

We have come together to-night

We have great reason to be thankful

We have heard lately

We have here plain proof

We have need to examine

We have no means of knowing

We have no other alternative

We have not yet solved the problem

We have sought on this occasion

We have the evidence of this

We have the good fortune to-night

We have to admit

We have witnessed on many occasions

We hear it is said sometimes

We hear no complaint

We heartily wish and mean

We hold fast to the principle

We laugh to scorn the idea

We may all of us agree

We may be permitted to remember

We need not trouble ourselves

We of this generation

We often hear persons say

We ought in strict propriety

We pride ourselves upon the fact

We rightly pay all honor

We see in a variety of ways

We shall all doubtless concede

We shall be blind not to perceive

We shall do well to remember

We shall have no difficulty in determining

We should be convinced

We should contemplate and compare

We should dread nothing so much

We should lend our influence

We should not question for a moment

What remains but to wish you

What strikes the mind so forcibly

What, then, I may be asked

What, then, is the use

What, then, was the nature of

What was the consequence of

What we are concerned to know is

What we have most to complain of

What would you say

Whatever opinion I may express

Whatever the truth may be

When I am told

When I hear it said

Whence it is, I say

Whence was the proof to come

While acknowledging the great value

While I feel most keenly the honor

While I have hinted to you

Whilst I am on this matter

Who can deny the effect

Who can say in a word

Who does not like to see

Who has not felt the contrast

Who that reads does not see

Who will accuse me

Why, again, should I take notice

Why need you seek to disprove

Will any gentleman say

Will anyone answer

Will it be whispered

Will it not be well for us

Will you allow me to present to you

Will you bear with me

Will you mistake this

Will you permit me to thank you

With possibly a single exception

With respect to what has been said

With this ideal clearly before us

With whatever opinions we come here

Without my saying a word more
