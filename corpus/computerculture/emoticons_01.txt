Emoticons
Show your friends how you really feel.

These little characters are a great way to spice up your IM conversations and show friends how you feel. Select them from the emoticon menu or type the keyboard shortcuts directly into your message. If the name of an emoticon is in bold, you can also include it in your status message - just type the characters for the emoticon into your status message (Yahoo! Messenger 9.0, 10 only).
