Dear Michael Hart and Project Gutenberg:

This text comes over a little odd in ASCII.  Like MONDO2000--
the zine we made infamous-- this book relies on its wacked
layout and bizarre illustrations for much of its meaning, not
to say charm.

And it was difficult to figure what should be considered the
first chapter, for obvious reasons.  I think the first
chapter really includes Section II,
but never mind.  Here it is, the beginning of...

|    INTRODUCTION to The Real Cyberpunk Fakebook       |
|                  by Bruce Sterling,                  |
|              A Renowned Cyberpunk Writer             |
|                                                      |
========================================================

I like this book so much that I'm thinking of changing
my name to St.Erling.  You couldn't ask for better guides to
faking cyberpunk than these two utterly accomplished Bay Area
fraudsters.  These two characters are such consummate boho
hustlers that they make Aleister Crowley look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm.

I don't believe in smart drugs, and I've never believed
in smart drugs, but I do believe the following.  It's
genuinely useful to society to have some small, contained
fraction of reckless fools who are willing to consume
untested and unknown devices and substances.  Sure, most of
them will have their hearts explode or break out into great
purple bleeding thalidomide warts.  But who knows, maybe
someday one of these jaspers will be eating handfuls of
psychoactive crap out of some hippie pharmacy and he or she
will suddenly learn to read Japanese in the original in six
days.  That's not at all likely, but it could happen-- grant me the
possibility.

The only drawback to this decentralized, libertarian,
free-market regime of biomedical research is that you have to
be ruthlessly prepared to sacrifice certain people-- just
write 'em off, basically, like a cageful of control hamsters
down at the NIMH.  And if I ever met a man uniquely suited to
this particular cutting-edge role in life, it is R.U. Sirius. R. U.
Sirius basically resembles Gomez Addams in a purple
fedora with an Andy Warhol badge pinned to the brim.  The
moment I met R.U., I felt a strong need to pith him and
examine his viscera.  I'm sure there are many other freelance
biomedical researchers who will feel the same intellectual
impulse.  Read this book and you'll see what I mean.

Then there's this saint person.  Never draw to an inside
straight.  Never eat at a place called Mom's.  And never eat
a bag of ephedrine and a pumpkin pie  ("the *whip* of
vegetables!") from a California blonde who doesn't even have
a real name.  This female personage is so appallingly cagey
that even her main squeeze delights in cryptographically
baffling the NSA.  If Pat Buchanan ever gets his not-so-
secret wish and sets up a domestic American gulag for
counterculture thought-criminals, the Judester's gonna be
way, *way* up on the list-- maybe even number two, right after Bob Dobbs.
 Her trial's likely to prove rather
interesting, however, as she only commits "crimes" in areas
of social activity that haven't even been defined yet, much
less successfully criminalized.  A serious legal study of
this woman's spectrum of activities would be like a CAT-scan
of the American unconscious.

There's also Bart Nagel, who is too nice a guy to be in the
company of these people.

Almost everything in this swell book is completely true.
Except for everything about me.  And my closest co-
conspirators.  We actual cyberpunks-- by this I mean *science
fiction writers*, dammit, the people for whom the c-word was
invented, the people who were professionally ahead of our
time and were cyberpunks *twelve years ago*-- we never sneer
and we never dress like, God forbid, Tom Wolfe.  We just
laugh at inappropriate times (like when testifying in
Congress) and we dress and act just like industrial design
professors.

I hope this brief intro clears up any confusion.  If you
have any trouble at all with this book, take full advantage
of your online d00dship and send email.  Don't be afraid to
ask "stupid" questions-- that's what the Internet is for!
Ask nice, big, broad, open-ended questions.  Stuff like "I'm
doing a term paper so please tell me everything you know
about cyberspace" or "I'm cyberpunk fan from Bulgaria and
Enlgish not too good, but please say more what is about
Virtual Reality?"

Just don't send the email to me, of course.  Send email
to them.  After this book, they deserve it!  I feel sure that
you'll get prompt answers that will surprise you.

WORDS IN BOLDFACE
(enclosed in double <<angle braces>> for the ASCII version)

These are terms that are defined in *Building
Your Cyber Word Power*.  Check there for anything that
baffles you.

Sometimes there's a double-anglebrace-enclosed term in the
text that refers to a chapter subheading, and then you
must practice your <<haqr smarts>> in order to find it.
If all else fails, you could ask Bruce Sterling at his
secret email address-- bruces@well.com.  He will know.

THE SHURIKEN AWARDS

We may sometimes succumb to the temptation to rate things the
way snotty critics do, by awarding stars.  However, we will
award them as *shuriken*, a cyber kinda star:

          ^          ^          ^
        < X >      < X >      < X >
          v          v          v

A shuriken is a throwing star-- a shiny-steel, sharp-edged,
sharp-pointed weapon from Japan (which is cyberpunk's
original home in certain misty urban legends).  The shuriken
itself as an assault weapon would rate one-half shuriken on a
scale of four.  A hydrogen bomb would rate five shuriken.
You get the idea.

Occasionally we may add Propeller Beanies to the Shuriken:

      <<<o>>>      <<<o>>>      <<<o>>>
       __|__        __|__        __|__
      /_____\      /_____\      /_____\

This indicates nerdly interest over and above a cyberpunk
rating.  Propeller head is an ancient term for <<nerd>>.
The real name for that key on the Macintosh is not COMMAND,
but PROPELLER, and this is why.

======================================================
Chapter 1:
CYBERPUNK: A CHALLENGING POSTMODERN LIFESTYLE CHOICE
 Why Bother? Big Wins! (and Unexpected Smallstuff)
======================================================

Cyberpunk is extremely hip.  Being extremely hip is the last
hope for people with no money and no power.  Being hip gets
you big wins in the status game.  Hipness can crush your
enemies and attract the apposite sex.  Best of all, cyberpunk
is the next big thing AFTER the next big thing.  You can hop
on the cyberpunk bandwagon and coast for a long, long time.
Think of the money you'll save on wardrobe updates!  The
worry you'll save on lifestyle decisions!

Cyberpunk has not yet been co-opted.  In fact, this handbook
is the very first exploitation of this hip new underground
trend.  This is the ground floor.  Get in on it!


======================================================
Chapter 2:    ACHIEVING CYBERPUNK
             Being It or Faking It
======================================================

What is there to know about being a cyberpunk?  Leather
jacket, mirrorshades-- that just about does it, right?  This
kind of patronizing shirt must farking DIE.*

*Since we can't afford to offend any parental units who might
*purchase this book for their family circle, all chancy verbs
*and nouns have been cleverly encyphered.  This is in the
*spirit of true cyberpunkhood, see <<Encryption>>.

You think cyberpunk is just a leather jacket, some chrome
studs, and fully reflective sunglasses?  You think that's all
there is?  Hah!  You can find those on Kansas City bikers and
the whole California Highway Patrol.  The true cyberpunk
might tuck a *cellular-modem laptop* under a spiked leather
arm, and a *laser pointer* in the upper zip pocket.  Or, a true cyberpunk may
look just like YOU.  But sHe** who knows
doesn't tell, and **hirm who tells doesn't know.

**Pronoun disclaimer:
**All pronouns in this book started life as intact males--
**he, his, and him.  If anything bad happened to them
**afterwards, blame it on the Riot Grrrls Bobbitt Squad.

The lifestyle and goals of the true cyberpunk are carefully
guarded secrets in a life *totally devoted* to coolness and
secrecy.  We will PIERCE THE VEIL, and REVEAL those SECRETS.
We will display for you the INNER CYBERPUNK.  We will give
you everything you need to know about embarking on this
challenging lifestyle.  When you have read to the end of this
EASY handbook, if you DON'T pass the hipness quiz... well,
just read it again.  But turn your TV up louder.


======================================================
Chapter 3: A STYLE GUIDE TO THE CYBERTYPES
           Recognizing Them and Fitting In
======================================================

While a cyberpunk is commonly a middleclass white male with way too many
electrons, there are varieties of cyberpunk.  Underlying all the types and
genres is Basic Cyber Style, which breaks down to physical gear and mental
attitude:

--->Basic Cyberpunk Gear
is simple.  Black leather jacket.  Boots.  Mirrorshades.  Laser pointer.  (We
don't know why all cyberpunks need a laser pointer, but it's mandatory.)
 We'll give you a more elaborate guide to basic cyberpunk gear.  Later.

--->The Basic Cyberpunk Attitude
is quiet assurance.  Subdued swashbuckling.  Maybe a little menace.

With these cyberpunk basics you can navigate through all the sub-genres.  But
if you want to pass as a native in a particular cyber sub-scene without
getting jeered at or beaten up, you gotta accessorize, and pay close
attention to detail.

>>>>Motorpsycho Maniacs
Cyberbikers pack the mystique of both worlds-- high tech, and big greasy loud
engines.  Standard cyberpunk costume is ideal for riding motorcycles, and a
mirrorshades helmet is a big plus for the cyber look-- mega robotic coolness.
 Motorcycles are dangerous and can kill you.  This is also cool.

>>>>Goths, Deathcore, and Vampire-Wannabes
Ideally, for this sub-scene, you should know about The Cure,
which is a band.  To fit in, grow your hair big and dye it
blueblack.  Spray it with <<Aquanet White>> to make it stick
out, medusa-like.  Go to a kidshop and buy plastic fangs.
(The kind that glow in the dark are funny.  Funny is NOT the
object here.)  All sexes should wear a Victorian shirt--
blouse-- white or black only--- that gapes to show flesh.  You
must practice looking tormented, tall and thin.  The ideal is
chalk-white face makeup with blueblack eyesockets.  Blueblack
makeup with white eyesockets is untested, but might work very
well, if you avoid a minstrel look.  At all times think
intensity and torment.  Torment...and ironic bitterness.  No
giggling or snickering, no kidding.

>>>>Riot Grrrls!
These are fierce girls who like tech.  This is a sexist
category, but there we are: girls only.  A grrrl can be
called "d00d" and "guy" at all times, but a non-female guy
is not a grrrl.  This is just the way things are.
If you're a grrrl, you can wear anything you want to,
because you're there to defend it.  This is true for anybody,
really-- look as tough as you wanta be, and be ready to back
it up.  Fierce is good.  Grrrls with tech expertise are
irresistible.  NOTHING is more attractive than a fierce,
blazing, ninja-type grrrl right now, and if she knows UNIX
or phone-freeking, the world is hers.  Hrrrs.

>>>>Technopagans/Ravers/Neohippies
Don't worry about this one.  This scene is free, loving,
noncomforming, spontaneous.  You can dress any old way
and fit right in...
Unless you don't look cool.

Maybe you should stick to basic cyberpunk.  Dancing in
leather is hot as h*ck, but sweating is better than not
looking cool.  Non-cyber ravers favor floppy hats, five
kinds of plaid 'n' paisley, and multiple organ piercings.
They sometimes take raver drugs.  These drugs make you fonder
of other people than you really want to be.  (The morning-
after Revulsion hangovers can be nasty.)  In this scene,
pretending to be on raver drugs is recommended, and easy,
too.  Unfocus your eyes and smile lovingly.  In black leather
you won't have to worry so much about getting hugged.

>>>>Academic Cyber-Wannabes
Students, teachers, whatever, dress down.  Like you're always
en route to a garage sale...maybe to donate what you're
wearing.  Casual.  Jeans, black leather jacket, laser
pointer.  No tweed, notice, and no Birkenshtocken.  If you
flash paperbacks by Arthur Kroker, Paul Virilio and Jean
Baudrillard, it means you're serious.  Paperbacks by Mark
Leyner and Kathy Acker means you're *way past* serious.

>>>>Cybercowboys/grrrls
Some of these people come from Texas or Oklahoma.  In this crew, to yr
cyberbasics you add a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and grow any hair you've got
really LONG.  Males should try to get hair somewhere on their faces.

>>>>Science Fiction Writers
Full-steam straight-ahead hard edge, with a permanent sneer.  Just to twist
heads, some males writers go for the Tom Wolfe effete look-- blue blazer and
wing-tips.  Still they sneer.

>>>>Web Crawlers and Other Bourgeois Types
You don't really care about this one, do you?  You do?  Subscribe to WIRED.
 Next.

>>>>Deep Geek:
Supernerds, Hackers, Wizards, Phone Phreakers
Things get difficult here.  Deep geekware is unstandard.
  Very heavy Wizards can look like accountants, or like
streetpeople.  Facial hair and Goodwill Casual happen a lot.
  Chubby happens too, since these guys don't do enough
dancing in leather pants.  To get along in this scene, you
really need to be very smart, very funny, or very sexy.  To
work yourself up to smart at least, learn UNIX.  Or carry
the 2600 zine in your back pocket and read that.  Practice
being technical.  But until you get good, wear your
cyberbasics and never leave home without your laser pointer.
This will draw the admiration of people who don't know any
better, which has its own rewards.  Leading us inevitably to
the final category...

>>>>Phonies, Poseurs and Pretenders:
Taking the Easy Way In
Don't think: scheme!  Forget about reading books, buy no
computers or widgets.  Don't do or buy anything.  Save all
your money for clothes and art materials.  Make your
girl/boyfriend help you assemble your hi-tek models-- you're
gonna need mockups of a laptop computer, a personal
communicator, a beeper, maybe even a fake stun-gun.  Realism
is key.  Then wear them all with *attitude*.  You're better
than real.  Strut.  Sneer.  Remember the 3 disses: distrust,
disrespect, distroy.  Wait, that's not right, is it?

We know there are going to be mutterings about this category.
Grumblings that being a poseur is not as easy as we think.
A poseur has a lot of overhead-- in worry, just for starts--
what if you're exposed as <<a clueless>>?  And staying locked
to the HOTWIRED Website to catch what you should be
imitating?  Dang.
