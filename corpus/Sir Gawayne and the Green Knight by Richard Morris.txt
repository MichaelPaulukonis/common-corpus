PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

In re-editing the present romance-poem I have been saved all labour of
transcription by using the very accurate text contained in Sir F. Madden's
"Syr Gawayne."

I have not only read his copy with the manuscript, but also the
proof-sheets as they came to hand, hoping by this means to give the reader
a text free from any errors of transcription.

The present edition differs from that of the earlier one in having the
contractions of the manuscript expanded and side-notes added to the text to
enable the reader to follow with some degree of ease the author's pleasant
narrative of Sir Gawayne's adventures.

The Glossary is taken from Sir F. Madden's "Syr Gawayne,"[1] to which, for
the better interpretation of the text, I have made several additions, and
have, moreover, glossed nearly all the words previously left unexplained.

For a description of the Manuscript, and particulars relating to the
authorship and dialect of the present work, the reader is referred to the
preface to Early English Alliterative Poems.

INTRODUCTION.

No Knight of the Round Table has been so highly honoured by the old
Romance-writers as Sir Gawayne, the son of Loth, and nephew to the renowned
Arthur. They delighted to describe him as Gawayne the good, a man matchless
on mould, the most gracious that under God lived, the hardiest of hand, the
most fortunate in arms, and the most polite in hall, whose knowledge,
knighthood, kindly works, doings, doughtiness, and deeds of arms were known
in all lands.

When Arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed
in blood, he is said to have exclaimed, "O righteous God, this blood were
worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold!" Our author, too, loves to
speak of his hero in similar terms of praise, calling him the knight
faultless in his five wits, void of every offence, and adorned with every
earthly virtue. He represents him as one whose trust was in the five
wounds, and in whom the five virtues which distinguished the true knight
were more firmly established than in any other on earth.

The author of the present story, who, as we know from his religious poems,
had an utter horror of moral impurity, could have chosen no better subject
for a romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be combined.
In the following tale he shows how the true knight, though tempted sorely
not once alone, but twice, nay thrice, breaks not his vow of chastity, but
turns aside the tempter's shafts with the shield of purity and arm of
faith, and so passes scatheless through the perilous defile of trial and
opportunity seeming safe.

But while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from the
"Roman de Perceval" by Chrestien de Troyes, he has made the narrative more
attractive by the introduction of several original and highly interesting
passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of our ancestors.

The following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial
notice:--

    I. The mode of completely arming a knight (ll. 568-589).

    II. The hunting and breaking the deer (ll. 1126-1359).

    III. The hunting and unlacing the wild boar (ll. 1412-1614).

    IV. A fox hunt (ll. 1675-1921).

The following is an outline of the story of Gawayne's adventures, more or
less in the words of the writer himself:--

    Arthur, the greatest of Britain's kings, holds the Christmas festival
    at Camelot, surrounded by the celebrated knights of the Round Table,
    noble lords, the most renowned under heaven, and ladies the loveliest
    that ever had life (ll. 37-57). This noble company celebrate the New
    Year by a religious service, by the bestowal of gifts, and the most
    joyous mirth. Lords and ladies take their seats at the table--Queen
    Guenever, the grey-eyed, gaily dressed, sits at the daïs, the high
    table, or table of state, where too sat Gawayne and Ywain together with
    other worthies of the Round Table (ll. 58-84, 107-115). Arthur, in mood
    as joyful as a child, his blood young and his brain wild, declares that
    he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing,
    some uncouth tale, some great marvel, or some encounter of arms has
    occurred to mark the return of the New Year (ll. 85-106).

    The first course was announced with cracking of trumpets, with the
    noise of nakers and noble pipes.

      "Each two had dishes twelve,
      Good beer and bright wine both."

    Scarcely was the first course served when another noise than that of
    music was heard. There rushes in at the hall-door a knight of gigantic
    stature--the greatest on earth--in measure high. He was clothed
    entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178). Fair wavy
    hair fell about the shoulders of the Green Knight, and a great beard
    like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).

    The knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one hand a holly
    bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge of which was
    as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). Thus arrayed, the Green Knight
    enters the hall without saluting any one. The first word that he
    uttered was, "Where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would I see
    him and with himself speak reason." To the knights he cast his eye,
    looking for the most renowned. Much did the noble assembly marvel to
    see a man and a horse of such a hue, green as the grass. Even greener
    they seemed than green enamel on bright gold. Many marvels had they
    seen, but none such as this. They were afraid to answer, but sat
    stone-still in a dead silence, as if overpowered by sleep;

      "Not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).

    Then Arthur before the high daïs salutes the Green Knight, bids him
    welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his Court. The knight says
    that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek the most
    valiant of the heroes of the Round Table that he may put his courage to
    the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of Arthur's court.
    "I come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that I bear
    here. Had I come with hostile intentions, I should not have left my
    hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, and other weapons behind me. But
    because I desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' If thou be so bold as
    all men say, thou wilt grant me the request I am about to make." "Sir
    courteous knight," replies Arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
    failest thou not to fight." "Nay," says the Green Knight, "I seek no
    fighting. Here about on this bench are only beardless children. Were I
    arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me
    (ll. 250-282). But it is now Christmas time, and this is the New Year,
    and I see around me many brave ones;--if any be so bold in his blood
    that dare strike a stroke for another, I shall give him this rich axe
    to do with it whatever he pleases. I shall abide the first blow just as
    I sit, and will stand him a stroke, stiff on this floor, provided that
    I deal him another in return.

      And yet give I him respite,
      A twelvemonth and a day;
      Now haste and let see tite (soon)
      Dare any here-in ought say.'"

    If he astounded them at first, much more so did he after this speech,
    and fear held them all silent. The knight, righting himself in his
    saddle, rolls fiercely his red eyes about, bends his bristly green
    brows, and strokes his beard awaiting a reply. But finding none that
    would carp with him, he exclaims, "What! is this Arthur's house, the
    fame of which has spread through so many realms? Forsooth, the renown
    of the Round Table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for
    all tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). With
    this he laughed so loud that Arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed
    as wroth as the wind. "I know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy
    great words. Give me now thy axe and I will grant thee thy request!"
    Arthur seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it
    about, while the Green Knight, with a stern cheer and a dry
    countenance, stroking his beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the
    blow (ll. 314-335). Sir Gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his
    uncle to let him undertake the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty
    of his nobles, Arthur consents "to give Gawayne the game" (ll.
    336-365).

    Sir Gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the blow is
    dealt, the Green Knight asks the name of his opponent. "In good faith,"
    answers the good knight, "Gawayne I am called, that bids thee to this
    buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
    take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no
    wight else alive." "By Gog," quoth the Green Knight, "it pleases me
    well that I shall receive at thy fist that which I have sought
    here--moreover thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the
    covenant,--but thou shalt first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek
    me thyself, wheresoever on earth thou believest I may be found, and
    fetch thee such wages as thou dealest me to-day before this company of
    doughty ones." "Where should I seek thee?" replies Gawayne, "where is
    thy place? I know not thee, thy court, or thy name. I wot not where
    thou dwellest, but teach me thereto, tell me how thou art called, and I
    shall endeavour to find thee,--and that I swear thee for truth and by
    my sure troth." "That is enough in New Year," says the groom in green,
    "if I tell thee when I have received the tap. When thou hast smitten
    me, then smartly I will teach thee of my house, my home, and my own
    name, so that thou mayest follow my track and fulfil the covenant
    between us. If I spend no speech, then speedest thou the better, for
    then mayest thou remain in thy own land and seek no further; but cease
    thy talking[1] (ll. 366-412). Take now thy grim tool to thee and let us
    see how thou knockest." "Gladly, sir, for sooth," quoth Gawayne, and
    his axe he brandishes.

      [Footnote 1: This, I think, is the true explanation of slokes.]

    The Green Knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends slightly his
    head, lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays bare his neck
    for the blow. Gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it on high,
    let it fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head from
    the body. The fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many
    turned it aside with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood burst
    from the body, yet the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he
    started forth on stiff shanks and fiercely rushed forward, seized his
    head, and lifted it up quickly. Then he runs to his horse, the bridle
    he catches, steps into his stirrups and strides aloft. His head by the
    hair he holds in his hands, and sits as firmly in his saddle as if no
    mishap had ailed him, though headless he was (ll. 413-439). He turned
    his ugly trunk about--that ugly body that bled,--and holding the head
    in his hand, he directed the face toward the "dearest on the dais." The
    head lifted up its eyelids and looked abroad, and thus much spoke with
    its mouth as ye may now hear:

    "Loke, Gawayne, thou be prompt to go as thou hast promised, and seek
    till thou find me according to thy promise made in the hearing of these
    knights. Get thee to the Green Chapel, I charge thee, to fetch such a
    dint as thou hast dealt, to be returned on New Year's morn. As the
    Knight of the Green Chapel I am known to many, wherefore if thou
    seekest thou canst not fail to find me. Therefore come, or recreant be
    called." With a fierce start the reins he turns, rushes out of the
    hall-door, his head in his hand, so that the fire of the flint flew
    from the hoofs of his foal. To what kingdom he belonged knew none
    there, nor knew they from whence he had come. What then?

      "The king and Gawayne there
      At that green (one) they laugh and grin."

    Though Arthur wondered much at the marvel, he let no one see that he
    was at all troubled about it, but full loudly thus spake to his comely
    queen with courteous speech:

    "Dear dame, to-day be never dismayed, well happens such craft at
    Christmas time. I may now proceed to meat, for I cannot deny that I
    have witnessed a wondrous adventure this day" (ll. 440-475).

    He looked upon Sir Gawayne and said, "Now, sir, hang up thine axe, for
    enough has it hewn." So the weapon was hung up on high that all might
    look upon it, and "by true title thereof tell the wonder." Then all the
    knights hastened to their seats at the table, so did the king and our
    good knight, and they were there served with all dainties, "with all
    manner of meat and minstrelsy."

    Though words were wanting when they first to seat went, now are their
    hands full of stern work, and the marvel affords them good subject for
    conversation. But a year passes full quickly and never returns,--the
    beginning is seldom like the end; wherefore this Christmas passed away
    and the year after, and each season in turn followed after another (ll.
    476-520). Thus winter winds round again, and then Gawayne thinks of his
    wearisome journey (ll. 521-535). On All-hallows day Arthur entertains
    right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew,
    for whom all courteous knights and lovely ladies were in great grief.
    Nevertheless they spoke only of mirth, and, though joyless themselves,
    made many a joke to cheer the good Sir Gawayne (ll. 536-565). Early on
    the morrow Sir Gawayne, with great ceremony, is arrayed in his armour
    (ll. 566-589), and thus completely equipped for his adventure he first
    hears mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur, the knights of the
    Round Table, and the lords and ladies of the court, who kiss him and
    commend him to Christ. He bids them all good day, as he thought, for
    evermore (ll. 590-669);

      "Very much was the warm water that poured from eyes that day."

    Now rides our knight through the realms of England with no companion
    but his foal, and no one to hold converse with save God alone. From
    Camelot, in Somersetshire, he proceeds through Gloucestershire and the
    adjoining counties into Montgomeryshire, and thence through North Wales
    to Holyhead, adjoining the Isle of Anglesea (ll. 670-700), from which
    he passes into the very narrow peninsula  of Wirral, in Cheshire, where
    dwelt but few that loved God or man. Gawayne enquires after the Green
    Knight of the Green Chapel, but all the inhabitants declare that they
    have never seen "any man of such hues of green."

    The knight thence pursues his journey by strange paths, over hill and
    moor, encountering on his way not only serpents, wolves, bulls, bears,
    and boars, but wood satyrs and giants. But worse than all those,
    however, was the sharp winter, "when the cold clear water shed from the
    clouds, and froze ere it might fall to the earth. Nearly slain with the
    sleet he slept in his armour, more nights than enough, in naked rocks"
    (ll. 701-729).

    Thus in peril and plight the knight travels on until Christmas-eve, and
    to Mary he makes his moan that she may direct him to some abode. On the
    morn he arrives at an immense forest, wondrously wild, surrounded by
    high hills on every side, where he found hoary oaks full huge, a
    hundred together. The hazel and the hawthorn intermingled were all
    overgrown with moss, and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that
    piteously piped for pain of the cold. Gawayne besought the Lord and
    Mary to guide him to some habitation where he might hear mass (ll.
    730-762). Scarcely had he crossed himself thrice, when he perceived a
    dwelling in the wood set upon a hill. It was the loveliest castle he
    had ever beheld. It was pitched on a prairie, with a park all about it,
    enclosing many a tree for more than two miles. It shone as the sun
    through the bright oaks (ll. 763-772).

    Gawayne urges on his steed Gringolet, and finds himself at the "chief
    gate." He called aloud, and soon there appeared a "porter" on the wall,
    who demanded his errand.

    "Good sir," quoth Gawayne, "wouldst thou go to the high lord of this
    house, and crave a lodging for me?"

    "Yea, by Peter!" replied the porter, "well I know that thou art welcome
    to dwell here as long as thou likest."

    The drawbridge is soon let down, and the gates opened wide to receive
    the knight. Many noble ones hasten to bid him welcome (ll. 773-825).
    They take away his helmet, sword, and shield, and many a proud one
    presses forward to do him honour. They bring him into the hall, where a
    fire was brightly burning upon the hearth. Then the lord of the land[1]
    comes from his chamber and welcomes Sir Gawayne, telling him that he is
    to consider the place as his own. Our knight is next conducted to a
    bright bower, where was noble bedding--curtains of pure silk, with
    golden hems, and Tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the floors (ll.
    826-859). Here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes,
    which so well became him, that all declared that a more comely knight
    Christ had never made (ll. 860-883).

      [Footnote 1: Gawayne is now in the castle of the Green Knight, who,
      divested of his elvish or supernatural character, appears to our
      knight merely as a bold one with a beaver-hued beard.]

    A table is soon raised, and Gawayne, having washed, proceeds to meat.
    Many dishes are set before him--"sews" of various kinds, fish of all
    kinds, some baked in bread, others broiled on the embers, some boiled,
    and others seasoned with spices. The knight expresses himself well
    pleased, and calls it a most noble and princely feast.

    After dinner, in reply to numerous questions, he tells his host that he
    is Gawayne, one of the Knights of the Round Table. When this was made
    known great was the joy in the hall. Each one said softly to his
    companion, "Now we shall see courteous behaviour and learn the terms of
    noble discourse, since we have amongst us 'that fine father of
    nurture.' Truly God has highly favoured us in sending us such a noble
    guest as Sir Gawayne" (ll. 884-927). At the end of the Christmas
    festival Gawayne desires to take his departure from the castle, but his
    host persuades him to stay, promising to direct him to the Green Chapel
    (about two miles from the castle), that he may be there by the
    appointed time (ll. 1029-1082).

    A covenant is made between them, the terms of which were that the lord
    of the castle should go out early to the chase, that Gawayne meanwhile
    should lie in his loft at his ease, then rise at his usual hour, and
    afterwards sit at table with his hostess, and that at the end of the
    day they should make an exchange of whatever they might obtain in the
    interim. "Whatever I win in the wood," says the lord, "shall be yours,
    and what thou gettest shall be mine" (ll. 1083-1125).

    Full early before daybreak the folk uprise, saddle their horses, and
    truss their mails. The noble lord of the land, arrayed for riding, eats
    hastily a sop, and having heard mass, proceeds with a hundred hunters
    to hunt the wild deer (ll. 1126-1177).

    All this time Gawayne lies in his gay bed. His nap is disturbed by a
    little noise at the door, which is softly opened. He heaves up his head
    out of the clothes, and, peeping through the curtains, beholds a most
    lovely lady (the wife of his host). She came towards the bed, and the
    knight laid himself down quickly, pretending to be asleep. The lady
    stole to the bed, cast up the curtains, crept within, sat her softly on
    the bed-side, and waited some time till the knight should awake. After
    lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant, Gawayne
    unlocked his eyelids, and put on a look of surprise, at the same time
    making the sign of the cross, as if afraid of some hidden danger (ll.
    1178-1207). "Good morrow, sir," said that fair lady, "ye are a careless
    sleeper to let one enter thus. I shall bind you in your bed, of that be
    ye sure." "Good morrow," quoth Gawayne, "I shall act according to your
    will with great pleasure, but permit me to rise that I may the more
    comfortably converse with you." "Nay, beau sir," said that sweet one,
    "ye shall not rise from your bed, for since I have caught my knight I
    shall hold talk with him. I ween well that ye are Sir Gawayne that all
    the world worships, whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised.
    Now ye are here, and we are alone (my lord and his men being afar off,
    other men, too, are in bed, so are my maidens), and the door is safely
    closed, I shall use my time well while it lasts. Ye are welcome to my
    person to do with it as ye please, and I will be your servant" (ll.
    1208-1240).

    Gawayne behaves most discreetly, for the remembrance of his forthcoming
    adventure at the Green Chapel prevents him from thinking of love (ll.
    1205-1289). At last the lady takes leave of the knight by catching him
    in her arms and kissing him (ll. 1290-1307). The day passes away
    merrily, and at dusk the Lord of the castle returns from the chase. He
    presents the venison to Gawayne according to the previous covenant
    between them. Our knight gives his host a kiss as the only piece of
    good fortune that had fallen to him during the day. "It is good," says
    the other, "and would be much better if ye would tell me where ye won
    such bliss" (ll. 1308-1394). "That was not in our covenant," replies
    Gawayne, "so try me no more." After much laughing on both sides they
    proceed to supper, and afterwards, while the choice wine is being
    carried round, Gawayne and his host renew their agreement. Late at
    night they take leave of each other and hasten to their beds. "By the
    time that the cock had crowed and cackled thrice" the lord was up, and
    after "meat and mass" were over the hunters make for the woods, where
    they give chase to a wild boar who had grown old and mischievous (ll.
    1395-1467).

    While the sportsmen are hunting this "wild swine" our lovely knight
    lies in his bed. He is not forgotten by the lady, who pays him an early
    visit, seeking to make further trial of his virtues. She sits softly by
    his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the
    day before (ll. 1468-1486). "I taught you of kissing," says she; "that
    becomes every courteous knight." Gawayne says that he must not take
    that which is forbidden him. The lady replies that he is strong enough
    to enforce his own wishes. Our knight answers that every gift not given
    with a good will is worthless. His fair visitor then enquires how it is
    that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned a
    knight, has never talked to her of love (ll. 1487-1524). "You ought,"
    she says, "to show and teach a young thing like me some tokens of
    true-love's crafts; I come hither and sit here alone to learn of you
    some game; do teach me of your wit while my lord is from home." Gawayne
    replies that he cannot undertake the task of expounding true-love and
    tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses. Thus
    did our knight avoid all appearance of evil, though sorely pressed to
    do what was wrong (ll. 1525-1552). The lady, having bestowed two kisses
    upon Sir Gawayne, takes her leave of him (ll. 1553-1557).

    At the end of the day the lord of the castle returns home with the
    shields and head of the wild boar. He shows them to his guest, who
    declares that "such a brawn of a beast, nor such sides of a swine," he
    never before has seen. Gawayne takes possession of the spoil according
    to covenant, and in return he bestows two kisses upon his host, who
    declares that his guest has indeed been rich with "such chaffer" (ll.
    1558-1647).

    After much persuasion, Gawayne consents to stop at the castle another
    day (ll. 1648-1685). Early on the morrow the lord and his men hasten to
    the woods, and come upon the track of a fox, the hunting of which
    affords them plenty of employment and sport (ll. 1686-1730). Meanwhile
    our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains. He is again
    visited by the lady of the castle. So gaily was she attired, and so
    "faultless of her features," that great joy warmed the heart of Sir
    Gawayne. With soft and pleasant smiles "they smite into mirth," and are
    soon engaged in conversation. Had not Mary thought of her knight, he
    would have been in great peril (ll. 1731-1769). So sorely does the fair
    one press him with her love, that he fears lest he should become a
    traitor to his host. The lady enquires whether he has a mistress to
    whom he has plighted his troth. The knight swears by St John that he
    neither has nor desires one. This answer causes the dame to sigh for
    sorrow, and telling him that she must depart, she asks for some gift,
    if it were only a glove, by which she might "think on the knight and
    lessen her grief" (ll. 1770-1800). Gawayne assures her that he has
    nothing worthy of her acceptance; that he is on an "uncouth errand,"
    and therefore has "no men with no mails containing precious things,"
    for which he is truly sorry.

    Quoth that lovesome (one)--

      "Though I had nought of yours,
       Yet should ye have of mine.

    Thus saying, she offers him a rich ring of red gold "with a shining
    stone standing aloft," that shone like the beams of the bright sun. The
    knight refused the gift, as he had nothing to give in return. "Since ye
    refuse my ring," says the lady, "because it seems too rich, and ye
    would not be beholden to me, I shall give you my girdle that is less
    valuable" (ll. 1801-1835). But Gawayne replies that he will not accept
    gold or reward of any kind, though "ever in hot and in cold" he will be
    her true servant.

    "Do ye refuse it," asks the lady, "because it seems simple and of
    little value? Whoso knew the virtues that are knit therein would
    estimate it more highly. For he who is girded with this green lace
    cannot be wounded or slain by any man under heaven." The knight thinks
    awhile, and it strikes him that this would be a "jewel for the
    jeopardy" that he had to undergo at the Green Chapel. So he not only
    accepts the lace, but promises to keep the possession of it a secret
    (ll. 1836-1865). By that time the lady had kissed him thrice, and she
    then takes "her leave and leaves him there."

    Gawayne rises, dresses himself in noble array, and conceals the "love
    lace" where he might find it again. He then hies to mass, shrives him
    of his misdeeds, and obtains absolution. On his return to the hall he
    solaces the ladies with comely carols and all kinds of joy (ll.
    1866-1892). The dark night came, and then the lord of the castle,
    having slain the fox, returns to his "dear home," where he finds a fire
    brightly turning and his guest amusing the ladies (ll. 1893-1927).
    Gawayne, in fulfilment of his agreement, kisses his host thrice.[1] "By
    Christ," quoth the other knight, "ye have caught much bliss. I have
    hunted all this day and nought have I got but the skin of this foul fox
    (the devil have the goods!), and that is full poor for to pay for such
    precious things" (ll. 1928-1951).

    After the usual evening's entertainment, Gawayne retires to rest. The
    next morning, being New Year's day, is cold and stormy. Snow falls, and
    the dales are full of drift. Our knight in his bed locks his eyelids,
    but full little he sleeps. By each cock that crows he knows the hour,
    and before day-break he calls for his chamberlain, who quickly brings
    him his armour (ll. 1952-2014). While Gawayne clothed himself in his
    rich weeds he forgot not the "lace, the lady's gift," but with it
    doubly girded his loins. He wore it not for its rich ornaments, "but to
    save himself when it behoved him to suffer," and as a safeguard against
    sword or knife (ll. 2015-2046).

    Having thanked his host and all the renowned assembly for the great
    kindness he had experienced at their hands, "he steps into stirrups and
    strides aloft" (ll. 2047-2068).

    The drawbridge is let down, and the broad gates unbarred and borne open
    upon both sides, and the knight, after commending the castle to Christ,
    passes thereout and goes on his way accompanied by his guide, that
    should teach him to turn to that place where he should receive the
    much-dreaded blow. They climb over cliffs, where each hill had a hat
    and a mist-cloak, until the next morn, when they find themselves on a
    full high hill covered with snow. The servant bids his master remain
    awhile, saying, "I have brought you hither at this time, and now ye are
    not far from that noted place that ye have so often enquired after. The
    place that ye press to is esteemed full perilous, and there dwells a
    man in that waste the worst upon earth, for he is stiff and stern and
    loves to strike, and greater is he than any man upon middle-earth, and
    his body is bigger than the best four in Arthur's house. He keeps the
    Green Chapel; there passes none by that place, however proud in arms,
    that he does not 'ding him to death with dint of his hand.' He is a man
    immoderate and 'no mercy uses,' for be it churl or chaplain that by the
    chapel rides, monk or mass-priest, or any man else, it is as pleasant
    to him to kill them as to go alive himself. Wherefore I tell thee
    truly, 'come ye there, ye be killed, though ye had twenty lives to
    spend. He has dwelt there long of yore, and on field much sorrow has
    wrought. Against his sore dints ye may not defend you' (ll. 2069-2117).
    Therefore, good Sir Gawayne, let the man alone, and for God's sake go
    by some other path, and then I shall hie me home again. I swear to you
    by

    [Footnote 1: He only in part keeps to his covenant, as he holds back
    the love-lace.]

    God and all His saints that I will never say that ever ye attempted to
    flee from any man."

    Gawayne thanks his guide for his well-meant kindness, but declares that
    to the Green Chapel he will go, though the owner thereof be "a stern
    knave," for God can devise means to save his servants.

    "Mary!" quoth the other, "since it pleases thee to lose thy life I will
    not hinder thee. Have thy helmet on thy head, thy spear in thy hand,
    and ride down this path by yon rock-side, till thou be brought to the
    bottom of the valley. Then look a little on the plain, on thy left
    hand, and thou shalt see in that slade the chapel itself, and the burly
    knight that guards it (ll. 2118-2148). Now, farewell Gawayne the noble!
    for all the gold upon ground I would not go with thee nor bear thee
    fellowship through this wood 'on foot farther.'" Thus having spoken, he
    gallops away and leaves the knight alone.

    Gawayne now pursues his journey, rides through the dale, and looks
    about. He sees no signs of a resting-place, but only high and steep
    banks, and the very shadows of the high woods seemed wild and
    distorted. No chapel, however, could he discover. After a while he sees
    a round hill by the side of a stream; thither he goes, alights, and
    fastens his horse to the branch of a tree. He walks about the hill,
    debating with himself what it might be. It had a hole in the one end
    and on each side, and everywhere overgrown with grass, but whether it
    was only an old cave or a crevice of an old crag he could not tell (ll.
    2149-2188).

    "Now, indeed," quoth Gawayne, "a desert is here; this oratory is ugly
    with herbs overgrown. It is a fitting place for the man in green to
    'deal here his devotions after the devil's manner.' Now I feel it is
    the fiend (the devil) in my five wits that has covenanted with me that
    he may destroy me. This is a chapel of misfortune--evil betide it! It
    is the most cursed kirk that ever I came in." With his helmet on his
    head, and spear in his hand, he roams up to the rock, and then he hears
    from that high hill beyond the brook a wondrous wild noise. Lo! it
    clattered in the cliff as if one upon a grindstone were grinding a
    scythe. It whirred like the water at a mill, and rushed and re-echoed,
    terrible to hear. "Though my life I forgo," says Gawayne, "no noise
    shall cause me to fear."

    Then he cried aloud, "Who dwells in this place, discourse with me to
    hold? For now is good Gawayne going right here if any brave wight will
    hie him hither, either now or never" (ll. 2189-2216).

    "Abide," quoth one on the bank above, over his head, "and thou shalt
    have all in haste that I promised thee once."

    Soon there comes out of a hole in the crag, with a fell weapon a Danish
    axe quite new, the "man in the green," clothed as at first as his legs,
    locks and beard. But now he is on foot and walks on the earth. When he
    reaches the stream, he hops over and boldly strides about. He meets Sir
    Gawayne, who tells him that he is quite ready to fulfil his part of the
    compact. "Gawayne," quoth that 'green gome' (man), "may God preserve
    thee! Truly thou art welcome to my place, 'and thou hast timed thy
    travel' as a true man should. Thou knowest the covenants made between
    us, at this time twelve-month, that on New Year's day I should return
    thee thy blow. We are now in this valley by ourselves, and can do as we
    please (ll. 2217-2246). Have, therefore, thy helmet off thy head, and
    'have here thy pay.' Let us have no more talk than when thou didst
    strike off my head with a single blow."

    "Nay, by God!" quoth Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy will for
    any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou strikest."

    Then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by any fear.
    The Green Knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his force
    raises it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. As the axe came
    gliding down Gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp
    iron." The other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with
    many proud words. "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed, that
    never feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for
    fear before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). Such cowardice of that
    knight did I never hear. I never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim
    at me in King Arthur's house. My head flew to my feet and yet I never
    fled, wherefore I deserve to be called the better man."

    Quoth Gawayne, "I shunted once, but will do so no more, though my head
    fall on the stones. But hasten and bring me to the point; deal me my
    destiny, and do it out of hand, for I shall stand thee a stroke and
    start no more until thine axe has hit me--have here my troth." "Have at
    thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft, and looks as
    savagely as if he were mad. He aims at the other mightily, but
    withholds his hand ere it might hurt. Gawayne readily abides the blow
    without flinching with any member, and stood still as a stone or a tree
    fixed in rocky ground with a hundred roots.

    Then merrily the other did speak, "Since now thou hast thy heart whole
    it behoves me to strike, so take care of thy neck." Gawayne answers
    with great wroth, "Thrash on, thou fierce man, thou threatenest too
    long; I believe thy own heart fails thee."

    "Forsooth," quoth the other, "since thou speakest so boldly, I will no
    longer delay" (ll. 2273-2304). Then, contracting "both lips and brow,"
    he made ready to strike, and let fall his axe on the bare neck of Sir
    Gawayne. "Though he hammered" fiercely, he only "severed the hide,"
    causing the blood to flow. When Gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
    quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. Then he drew out
    his bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "Cease, man, of thy blow, bid
    me no more. I have received a stroke in this place without opposition,
    but if thou givest me any more readily shall I requite thee, of that be
    thou sure. Our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now
    cease."

    The Green Knight, resting on his axe, looks on Sir Gawayne, as bold and
    fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus addresses the
    knight: "Bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has wronged thee
    (ll. 2305-2339); I promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it, so hold
    thee well pleased. I could have dealt much worse with thee, and caused
    thee much sorrow. Two blows I aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my
    fair wife; but I struck thee not, because thou restoredst them to me
    according to agreement. At the third time thou failedst, and therefore
    I have given thee that tap. That woven girdle, given thee by my own
    wife, belongs to me. I know well thy kisses, thy conduct also, and the
    wooing of my wife, for I wrought it myself. I sent her to try thee, and
    truly methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot went.
    Still, sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded from
    no immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less I
    blame thee."

    Gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and he shrank
    within himself for very shame. "Cursed," he cried, "be cowardice and
    covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue destroy."
    Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green,
    cursing his cowardice and covetousness. The Green Knight, laughing,
    thus spoke: "Thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy faults,
    that I hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast
    first born. I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of thy
    adventure at the Green Chapel. Come now to my castle, and we shall
    enjoy together the festivities of the New Year" (ll. 2340-2406).

    "Nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may God
    requite you. Commend me to that courteous one your comely wife, who
    with her crafts has beguiled me. But it is no uncommon thing for a man
    to come to sorrow through women's wiles; for so was Adam beguiled with
    one, and Solomon with many. Samson was destroyed by Delilah, and David
    suffered much through Bathsheba. 'It were indeed great bliss for a
    man to love them well and believe them not.' Since the greatest
    upon earth were so beguiled, methinks I should be excused. But God
    reward you for your girdle, which I will ever wear in remembrance of my
    fault, and when pride shall exalt me, a look to this love-lace shall
    lessen it (ll. 2407-2438). But since ye are the lord of yonder land,
    from whom I have received so much honour, tell me truly your right
    name, and I shall ask no more questions."

    Quoth the other, "I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through might of
    Morgain la Fay, who dwells in my house. Much has she learnt of Merlin,
    who knows all your knights at home. She brought me to your hall for to
    essay the prowess of the Round Table. She wrought this wonder to
    bereave you of your wits, hoping to have grieved Guenever and
    affrighted her to death by means of the man that spoke with his head in
    his hand before the high table. She is even thine aunt, Arthur's half
    sister; wherefore come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."

    Gawayne refuses to accompany the Green Knight, and so, with many
    embraces and kind wishes, they separate--the one to his castle, the
    other to Arthur's court.

    After passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the
    wound in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of
    King Arthur. Great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss
    their brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. He tells
    them of his adventures, hiding nothing--"the chance of the chapel, the
    cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
    Groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which
    he had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). The king and
    his courtiers comfort the knight--they laugh loudly at his adventures,
    and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the
    Round Table, and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear
    a bright green belt for Gawayne's sake. And he upon whom it was
    conferred honoured it evermore after.

    Thus in Arthur's time this adventure befell, whereof the "Brutus Books"
    bear witness (ll. 2505-2530).

I need not say that the Brutus Books we possess do not contain the
legend here set forth, though it is not much more improbable than some of
the statements contained in them. If the reader desires to know the
relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original Arthur
legends, he will find it discussed in Sir F. Madden's Preface to his
edition of "Syr Gawayne," which also contains a sketch of the very
different views taken of Sir Gawayne by the different Romance writers.

Into this and other literary questions I do not enter here, as I
have nothing to add to Sir F. Madden's statements; but in the text of the
Poem I have differed from him in some few readings, which will be found
noticed in the Notes and Glossary.

As the manuscript is fast fading, I am glad that the existence of the Early
English Text Society has enabled us to secure a wider diffusion of its
contents before the original shall be no longer legible.

We want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to give to
a large circle of readers many an equally interesting record of Early
English minds.

[Sidenote A: Arthur would not eat,]
[Sidenote B: nor would he long sit]

[Sidenote D: He of face so bold makes much mirth with all.]

[Sidenote A: There was no want of anything.]
[Sidenote B: Scarcely had the first course commenced,]
[Sidenote C: when there rushes in at the hall-door a knight;]
[Sidenote D: the tallest on earth]
[Sidenote E: he must have been.]
[Sidenote F: His back and breast were great,]
[Sidenote G: but his belly and waist were small.]

[Sidenote C: His saddle was embroidered with birds and flies.]
[Sidenote D: The foal that he rode upon was green;]

[Sidenote A: Gaily was the knight attired.]
[Sidenote B: His great beard, like a bush, hung on his breast.]
[Sidenote C: The horse's mane was decked with golden threads.]
[Sidenote D: Its tail was bound with a green band.]
[Sidenote E: Such a foal nor a knight were never before seen.]
[Sidenote F: It seemed that no man might endure his dints.]
[Footnote 1: as as, in MS.]

     [A] Wheþer hade he no helme ne hawb[e]rgh nauþer,

     [B] Bot in his on honde he hade a holyn bobbe,
         Þat is grattest in grene, when greue3 ar bare,
 208 [C] & an ax in his oþer, a hoge & vn-mete,
         A spetos sparþe to expoun in spelle quo-so my3t;

         Wyth tryed tassele3 þerto tacched in-noghe,
 220 [F] On botoun3 of þe bry3t grene brayden ful ryche.
         Þis haþel helde3 hym in, & þe halle entres,
         Driuande to þe he3e dece, dut he no woþe,
     [G] Haylsed he neuer one, bot he3e he ouer loked.
 224     Þe fyrst word þat he warp, "wher is," he sayd,
     [H] "Þe gouernour of þis gyng? gladly I wolde
         Se þat segg in sy3t, & with hym self speke
                 raysoun."
 228         To kny3te3 he kest his y3e,
             & reled hym vp & doun,
     [I]     He stemmed & con studie,
             Quo walt þer most renoun.

[Sidenote A: The knight carried neither spear nor shield,]
[Sidenote B: In one hand was a holly bough,]
[Sidenote C: in the other an axe,]
[Sidenote D: the edge of which was as keen as a sharp razor,]
[Sidenote E: and the handle was encased in iron, curiously "graven with
  green, in gracious works."]
[Sidenote F: Thus arrayed the Green Knight enters the hall,]
[Sidenote G: without saluting any one.]
[Sidenote H: He asks for the "governor" of the company,]
[Sidenote I: and looks for the most renowned.]
[Footnote 1: looks like gracons in MS.]

     [F]     Bot sum for cortaysye,
 248         Bot let hym þat al schulde loute,

[Sidenote A: Much they marvel to see a man and a horse]
[Sidenote B: as green as grass.]
[Sidenote C: Never before had they seen such a sight as this.]
[Sidenote D: They were afraid to answer,]
[Sidenote E: and were as silent as if sleep had taken possession of them;]
[Sidenote F: some from fear and others from courtesy.]

      XII.

     [A] Þenn Arþour bifore þe hi3 dece þat auenture byholde3,
         & rekenly hym reuerenced, for rad was he neuer,
 252     & sayde, "wy3e, welcum iwys to þis place,

         Bot for þe los of þe lede is lyft vp so hy3e,

             If þou craue batayl bare,
             Here fayle3 þou not to fy3t."

[Sidenote A: Arthur salutes the Green Knight.]
[Sidenote B: bids him welcome, and invites him to stay awhile.]
[Sidenote C: The knight says that he will not tarry.]
[Sidenote D: He seeks the most valiant that he may prove him.]
[Sidenote E: He comes in peace.]
[Sidenote F: At home, however, he has both shield and spear.]
[Sidenote G: Arthur assures him that he shall not fail to find an opponent
  worthy of him.]

      XIII.

     [A] "Nay, frayst I no fy3t, in fayth I þe telle,

[Sidenote A: "I seek no fight," says the knight.]
[Sidenote B: "'Here are only beardless children.']
[Sidenote C: Here is no man to match me.]
[Sidenote D: Here are brave ones many,]
[Sidenote E: if any be bold enough to 'strike a stroke for another,']
[Sidenote F: this axe shall be his;]
[Sidenote G: but I shall give him a 'stroke' in return]
[Sidenote H: within a twelvemonth and a day."]

     [A] If he hem stowned vpon fyrst, stiller were þanne
         Alle þe hered-men in halle, þe hy3 & þe lo3e;
     [B] Þe renk on his rounce hym ruched in his sadel,

     [D] Wayued his berde for to wayte quo-so wolde ryse.
         When non wolde kepe hym with carp he co3ed ful hy3e,
 308     Ande rimed hym ful richley, & ry3t hym to speke:
     [E] "What, is þis Arþures hous," quod þe haþel þenne,

             Þe kyng as kene bi kynde,
             Þen stod þat stif mon nere.

[Sidenote A: Fear kept all silent.]
[Sidenote B: The knight rolled his red eyes about,]
[Sidenote C: and bent his bristly green brows.]
[Sidenote D: Waving his beard awhile, he exclaimed:]
[Sidenote E: "What! is this Arthur's court?]
[Sidenote F: Forsooth the renown of the Round Table is overturned 'with a
  word of one man's speech.'"]
[Sidenote G: Arthur blushes for shame.]
[Sidenote H: He waxes as wroth as the wind.]

      XV.

     [A] Ande sayde, "haþel, by heuen þyn askyng is nys,

             "I be-seche now with sa3e3 sene,
             Þis melly mot be myne."

[Sidenote A: He assures the knight that no one is afraid of his great
  words.]
[Sidenote B: Arthur seizes his axe.]
[Sidenote C: The knight, stroking his beard, awaits the blow, and with a
  "dry countenance" draws down his coat.]
[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne beseeches the king to let him undertake the blow.]
[Footnote 1: chere (?).]

[Sidenote A: He asks permission to leave the table; he says,]
[Sidenote B: it is not meet that Arthur should be active in the matter,]

[Sidenote D: Although the weakest, he is quite ready to meet the Green
  Knight.]
[Sidenote E: The nobles entreat Arthur to "give Gawayne the game."]

[Sidenote C: The Green Knight enquires the name of his opponent.]

[Sidenote A: "It pleases me well, Sir Gawayne," says the Green Knight,
  "that I shall receive a blow from thy fist; but thou must swear that thou
  wilt seek me,]
[Sidenote B: to receive the blow in return."]
[Sidenote C: "Where shall I seek thee?" says Sir Gawayne;]
[Sidenote D: "tell me thy name and abode and I will find thee."]
[Sidenote E: "When thou hast smitten me," says the knight, "then tell I
  thee of my home and name;]
[Sidenote F: if I speak not at all, so much the better for thee.]
[Sidenote G: Take now thy grim tool, and let us see how thou knockest."]

[Sidenote C: Sir Gawayne lets fall his axe]
[Sidenote D: and severs the head from the body.]
[Sidenote E: The head falls to the earth.]
[Sidenote F: Many kick it aside with their feet.]
[Sidenote G: The knight never falters;]
[Sidenote H: he rushes forth, seizes his head,]
[Sidenote I: steps into the saddle,]
[Sidenote J: holding the while the head in his hand by the hair,]
[Sidenote K: and turns his horse about.]

[Sidenote D: Get thee to the Green Chapel,]
[Sidenote E: there to receive a blow on New Year's morn.]
[Sidenote F: Fail thou never;]

[Sidenote H: The Green Knight then rushes out of the hall, his head in his

[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne, hang up thine axe.]
[Sidenote E: The king and his knights sit feasting at the board till day is

[Sidenote A: This marvel serves to keep up a brisk conversation in Court.]
[Sidenote B: The year passes full quickly and never returns.]
[Sidenote C: After Christmas comes the "crabbed Lenten."]
[Sidenote D: Spring sets in and warm showers descend;]

[Sidenote F: Much sorrow prevails in the hall.]
[Sidenote G: Gawayne declares that he has nothing to fear.]

[Sidenote A: Thus arrayed the knight hears mass,]
[Sidenote B: and afterwards takes leave of Arthur and his court.]
[Sidenote C: By that time his horse Gringolet was ready,]
[Sidenote D: the harness of which glittered like the "gleam of the sun."]
[Sidenote E: Then Sir Gawayne sets his helmet upon his head,]
[Sidenote F: fastened behind with a "urisoun,"]
[Sidenote G: richly embroidered with gems.]
[Sidenote H: The circle around the helmet was decked with diamonds.]

     [A] Then þay schewed hym þe schelde, þat was of schyr goule3,

[Sidenote A: Then they show him his shield with the "pentangle" of pure
  gold.]
[Sidenote B: The "pentangle" was devised by Solomon as a token of truth.]
[Sidenote C: It is called the endless knot]
[Sidenote D: It well becomes the good Sir Gawayne,]
[Sidenote E: a knight the truest of speech and the fairest of form.]

         Þat alle his forsnes he fong at þe fyue ioye3,

 648     At þis cause þe kny3t comlyche hade

 664     Þat is þe pure pentaungel wyth þe peple called,         [Fol. 100]

[Sidenote A: He was found faultless in his five wits.]
[Sidenote B: His trust was in the five wounds.]
[Sidenote C: The image of the Virgin was depicted upon his shield.]
[Sidenote D: In cleanness and courtesy he was never found wanting,]
[Sidenote E: therefore was the endless knot fastened on his shield.]
[Sidenote F: Sir Gawayne seizes his lance and bids all "good day."]
[Footnote 1: MS fyft.]

             Þe bok as I herde say.

[Sidenote A: He spurs his horse and goes on his way.]
[Sidenote B: All that saw that seemly one mourned in their hearts.]
[Sidenote C: They declared that his equal was not to be found upon earth.]
[Sidenote D: It would have been better for him to have been a leader of
  men,]
[Sidenote E: than to die by the hands of "an elvish man."]
[Sidenote F: Much was the warm water that poured from eyes that day.]
[Sidenote G: Meanwhile many a weary way goes Sir Gawayne.]

[Sidenote A: Many a cliff he climbed over;]
[Sidenote B: many a ford and stream he crossed, and everywhere he found a
  foe.]
[Sidenote C: It were too tedious to tell the tenth part of his adventures]
[Sidenote D: with serpents, wolves, and wild men;]
[Sidenote E: with bulls, bears, and boars.]
[Sidenote F: Had he not been both brave and good, doubtless he had been
  dead.]
[Sidenote G: The sharp winter was far worse than any war that ever troubled
  him.]
[Sidenote H: Thus in peril he travels till Christmas-eve.]
[Sidenote I: To the Virgin Mary he prays to guide him to some abode.]

      XI.

[Sidenote D: Through many a mire he goes, that he may celebrate the birth
  of Christ.]
[Sidenote E: He beseeches the Virgin Mary to direct him to some lodging
  where he may hear mass.]
[Sidenote F: Blessing himself, he says, "Cross of Christ, speed me!"]

[Sidenote D: It shone as the sun through the bright oaks.]
[Sidenote E: Sir Gawayne goes to the chief gate,]

[Sidenote A: Then was Gringolet arrayed,]
[Sidenote B: full ready to prick on.]
[Sidenote C: Gawayne returns thanks for the honour and kindness shown to
  him by all.]
[Sidenote D: He then steps into his saddle,]
[Sidenote E: and "starts on the stone" without more delay.]
[Sidenote F: "This castle to Christ I commend; may he give it ever good

[Sidenote A: The gates are soon opened.]
[Sidenote B: The knight passes thereout,]

[Sidenote D: They climb by cliffs,]
[Sidenote E: where each "hill had a hat and a mist-cloak,"]

[Sidenote D: The lord of that 'waste' is stiff and stern.]
[Sidenote E: His body is bigger 'than the best four in Arthur's house.']
[Sidenote F: None passes by the Green Chapel, 'that he does not ding to

[Sidenote B: Go by some other region,]
[Sidenote C: I swear by God and all His saints, that I will never say that
  ever ye attempted to flee from any man."]
[Sidenote D: Gawayne replies that to shun this danger would mark him as a
  "coward knight."]
[Sidenote E: To the Chapel, therefore, he will go,]
[Sidenote F: though the owner thereof were a stern knave.]
[Sidenote G: "Full well can God devise his servants for to save."]

[Sidenote A: "Mary!" quoth the other, "since it pleases thee to lose thy

[Sidenote F: Having thus spoken the guide takes leave of the knight.]
[Sidenote G: "By God's self," says Sir Gawayne, "I will neither weep nor

[Sidenote A: Then he pursues his journey,]
[Sidenote B: rides through the dale, and looks about.]
[Sidenote C: He sees no sign of a resting-place, but only high and steep
  banks.]
[Sidenote D: No chapel could he discern.]
[Sidenote E: At last he sees a hill by the side of a stream;]
[Sidenote F: thither he goes,]
[Sidenote G: alights and fastens his horse to a branch of a tree.]
[Sidenote H: He walks around the hill, debating with himself what it might
  be,]
[Sidenote I: and at last finds an old cave in the crag.]
[Sidenote J: He prays that about midnight he may tell his matins.]

[Sidenote A: "Truly," says Sir Gawayne, "a desert is here,]
[Sidenote B: a fitting place for the man in green to 'deal here his
  devotions in devil fashion.']
[Sidenote C: It is most cursed kirk that ever I entered."]
[Sidenote D: Roaming about he hears a loud noise,]
[Sidenote E: from beyond the brook.]
[Sidenote F: It clattered like the grinding of a scythe on a grindstone.]
[Sidenote G: It whirred like a mill-stream.]
[Sidenote H: "Though my life I forgo," says the knight, "no noise shall
  terrify me."]

[Sidenote C: Now is the good Gawayne going aright]
[Sidenote D: He hears a voice commanding him to abide where he is.]
[Sidenote E: Soon there comes out of a hole, with a fell weapon,]
[Sidenote F: a Danish axe, quite new,]
[Sidenote G: the "knight in green," clothed as before.]
[Sidenote H: When he reaches the stream, he hops over and strides about.]
[Sidenote I: He meets Sir Gawayne without obeisance.]
[Sidenote J: The other tells him that he is now ready for conversation]

[Sidenote B: With all his force he raises it aloft.]
[Sidenote C: As it came gliding down,]
[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne shrank a little with his shoulders.]
[Sidenote E: The other reproved him, saying,]
[Sidenote F: "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed,]
[Sidenote G: for thou fleest for fear before thou feelest harm.]
[Sidenote H: I never flinched when thou struckest.]
[Sidenote I: My head flew to my foot, yet I never fled,]
[Sidenote J: wherefore I ought to be called the better man."]
[Sidenote K: "I shunted once," says Gawayne, "but will no more.]

[Sidenote A: Bring me to the point; deal me my destiny at once."]
[Sidenote B: "Have at thee, then," says the other.]
[Sidenote C: With that he aims at him a blow.]
[Sidenote D: Gawayne never flinches, but stands as still as a stone.]
[Sidenote E: "Now," says the Green Knight, "I must hit thee, since thy
  heart is whole."]
[Sidenote F: "Thrash on," says the other.]
[Sidenote G: Then the Green Knight makes ready to strike.]

[Sidenote A: He let fall his loom on the bare]
[Sidenote B: neck of Sir Gawayne.]
[Sidenote C: The sharp weapon pierced the flesh so that the blood flowed.]
[Sidenote D: When the knight saw the blood on the snow,]
[Sidenote E: he unsheathed his sword, and thus spake:]
[Sidenote F: "Cease, man, of thy blow.]
[Sidenote G: If thou givest me any more, readily shall I requite thee.]
[Sidenote H: Our agreement stipulates only one stroke."]

[Sidenote A: The Green Knight rested on his axe,]
[Sidenote B: looked on Sir Gawayne, who appeared bold and fearless,]
[Sidenote C: and addressed him as follows: "Bold knight, be not so wroth,]
[Sidenote D: I promised thee a stroke and thou hast it, be satisfied.]
[Sidenote E: I could have dealt worse with thee.]
[Sidenote F: I menaced thee with one blow for the covenant between us on
  the first night.]
[Sidenote G: Another I aimed at thee because thou kissedst my wife.]
[Sidenote H: A true man should restore truly, and then he need fear no
  harm.]
[Sidenote I: Thou failedst at the third time, and therefore take thee that

[Sidenote A: For my weed (woven by my wife) thou wearest.]
[Sidenote B: I know thy kisses and my wife's wooing.]
[Sidenote C: I sent her to try thee, and faultless I found thee.]
[Sidenote D: But yet thou sinnedst a little,]
[Sidenote E: for love of thy life."]
[Sidenote F: Gawayne stands confounded.]
[Sidenote G: "Cursed," he says, "be cowardice and covetousness both!"]
[Sidenote H: Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight.]
[Sidenote I: He curses his cowardice,]
[Sidenote J: and confesses himself to have been guilty of untruth.]
[Sidenote K: ]

             Þat wat3 your enmy kene."

[Sidenote A: Then the other, laughing, thus spoke:]
[Sidenote B: "Thou art confessed so clean,]
[Sidenote C: that I hold thee as pure as if thou hadst never been guilty.]
[Sidenote D: I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle,]
[Sidenote E: as a token of thy adventure at the Green Chapel.]
[Sidenote F: Come again to my abode, and abide there for the remainder of
  the festival."]

[Sidenote A: "Nay, forsooth," says Gawayne,]
[Sidenote B: "I have sojourned sadly, but bliss betide thee!]
[Sidenote C: Commend me to your comely wife and that other lady who have
  beguiled me.]
[Sidenote D: But it is no marvel for a man to be brought to grief through a
  woman's wiles.]
[Sidenote E: Adam, Solomon, Samson, and David were beguiled by women.]
[Sidenote F: How could a man love them and believe them not?]
[Sidenote G: Though I be now beguiled, methinks I should be excused.]

NOTES.

Line 8 Ricchis turns, goes,
       The king ...
      Ricchis his reynys and the Renke metys:
      Girden to gedur with þere grete speires.--T.B. l. 1232.

37    Þis kyng lay at Camylot vpon kryst-masse.
      Camalot, in Malory's "Morte Arthure," is said to be the same as
      Winchester. Ritson supposes it to be Caer-went, in Monmouthshire,
      and afterwards confounded with Caer-wynt, or Winchester. But
      popular tradition here seems the best guide, which assigned the site
      of Camalot to the ruins of a castle on a hill, near the church of
      South Cadbury, in Somersetshire (Sir F. Madden).

65    Nowel nayted o-newe, neuened ful ofte.
      Christmas celebrated anew, mentioned full often.
      Sir F. Madden leaves the word nayted unexplained in his Glossary
      to "Syr Gawayne."

124   syluener = sylueren, i.e. silver dishes.

139   lyndes = lendes, loins.

142   in his muckel, in his greatness.

184   Wat3 euesed al umbe-torne--? was trimmed, all cut evenly around;
      umbe-torne may be an error for vmbe-corue = cut round.

216   in gracios werkes. Sir F. Madden reads gracons for gracios, and
      suggests Greek as the meaning of it.

244-5 As al were slypped vpon slepe so slaked hor lote3
              in hy3e.
      As all were fallen asleep so ceased their words
              in haste (suddenly).
      Sir F. Madden reads slaked horlote3, instead of slaked hor lote3,
      which, according to his glossary, signifies drunken vagabonds.
      He evidently takes horlote3 to be another (and a very uncommon) form
      of harlote3 = harlots. But harlot, or vagabond, would be a very
      inappropriate term to apply to the noble Knights of the Round Table.
      Moreover, slaked never, I think, means drunken. The general sense of
      the verb slake is to let loose, lessen, cease. Cf. lines 411-2,
      where sloke, another form of slake, occurs with a similar meaning:
                 -- layt no fyrre;
                      bot slokes.
                 -- seek no further,
                      but stop (cease).
      Sir F. Madden suggests blows as the explanation of slokes. It
      is, however, a verb in the imperative mood.

286   Brayn. Mätzner suggests brayn-wod.

296   barlay = par loi. This word is exceedingly common in the T. Book
      (see l. 3391).
        I bid you now, barlay, with besines at all
        Þat ye set you most soverainly my suster to gete.--T.B. l. 2780.

394   siker. Sir F. Madden reads swer.

440   bluk. Sir F. Madden suggests blunk (horse). I am inclined to keep to
      the reading of the MS., and explain bluk as = bulk = trunk. Cf. the
      use of the word Blok in "Early English Alliterative Poems,"
      p. 100, l. 272.

558   derue doel, etc. = great grief. Sir F. Madden reads derne, i.e. secret,
      instead of derue (= derf). Cf. line 564.

577   knaged, fastened.
        The braunches were borly, sum of bright gold,
        With leuys full luffly, light of the same;
        With burions aboue bright to beholde;
        And fruit on yt fourmyt of fairest of shap,
        Of mony kynd that was knyt, knagged aboue.--T.B. l. 4973.

629     & ay quere hit is endele3, etc.
	And everywhere it is endless, etc.
      Sir F. Madden reads emdele3, i.e. with equal sides.

652   for-be = for-bi = surpassing, beyond.

681   for Hadet read Halet = haled = exiled (?). See line 1049.

806   auinant = auenaunt, pleasantly. Sir F. Madden reads amnant.

954   of. Should we not read on (?).

957     Þat oþer wyth a gorger wat3 gered ouer þe swyre.
      The gorger or wimple is stated first to have appeared in Edward the
      First's reign, and an example is found on the monument of Aveline,
      Countess of Lancaster, who died in 1269. From the poem, however, it
      would seem that the gorger was confined to elderly ladies (Sir F.
      Madden).

968     More lykker-wys on to lyk,
        Wat3 þat scho had on lode.

	A more pleasant one to like,
        Was that (one) she had under her control.

988   tayt = lively, and hence pleasant, agreeable.

1015  in vayres, in purity.

1020  dut = dunt (?) = dint (?), referring to sword-sports.

1022  sayn[t] Ione3 day. This is the 27th of December, and the last of the
      feast. Sometimes the Christmas festivities were prolonged to New
      Year's Day (Sir F. Madden).

1047  derne dede = secret deed. I would prefer to read derue dede =
      great deed. Cf. lines 558, 564.

1053  I wot in worlde, etc. = I not (I know not) in worlde, etc.

1054    I nolde, bot if I hit negh my3t on nw3eres morne,
        For alle þe londe in-wyth Logres, etc.
      I would not [delay to set out], unless I might approach it on New
      Year's morn, for all the lands within England, etc.

1074  in spenne = in space = in the interval = meanwhile. See line 1503.

1160  slentyng of arwes. Sir F. Madden reads sleutyng.
        "Of drawyn swordis sclentyng to and fra,
        The brycht mettale, and othir armouris seir,
        Quharon the sonnys blenkis betis cleir,
        Glitteris and schane, and vnder bemys brycht,
        Castis ane new twynklyng or a lemand lycht."
            (G. Douglas' Æneid, Vol. i, p. 421.)

1281   let lyk = appeared pleased.

1283    Þa3 I were burde bry3test, þe burde in mynde hade, etc.
      The sense requires us to read:
        Þa3 ho were burde bry3test, þe burne in mynde hade, etc.
      i.e., Though she were lady fairest, the knight in mind had, etc.

1440    Long sythen [seuered] for þe sounder þat wi3t for-olde
      Long since separated from the sounder or herd that fierce (one)
      for-aged (grew very old).
        "Now to speke of the boore, the fyrste year he is
        A pygge of the sounder callyd, as haue I blys;
        The secounde yere an hogge, and soo shall he be,
        And an hoggestere, whan he is of yeres thre;
        And when he is foure yere, a boor shall he be,
        From the sounder of the swyne thenne departyth he;
        A synguler is he soo, for alone he woll go."
            (Book of St. Alban's, ed. 1496, sig. d., i.)

1476  totes = looks, toots.
        Sho went up wightly by a walle syde.
        To the toppe of a toure and tot ouer the water.--T.B. l. 862.

1623  A verb [? lalede = cried] seems wanting after lorde.

1702  fnasted, breathed.
        These balfull bestes were, as the boke tellus,
        Full flaumond of fyre with fnastyng of logh.--T.B. l. 168.

1710  a strothe rande = a rugged path. Cf. the phrases tene greue, l. 1707;
      ro3e greue, l. 1898.

1719    Thenne wat3 hit lif vpon list, etc.
      Should we not read:
        Thenne wat3 hit list vpon lif, etc.
      i.e., Then was there joy in life, etc.

1729  bi lag = be-lagh(?) = below (?).

1780  lyf = lef(?), beloved (one).

1869    Ho hat3 kyst þe kny3t so to3t.
        She has kissed the knight so courteous.
      Sir F. Madden explains to3t, promptly. To3t seems to be the same as
      the Northumbrian taght in the following extract from the "Morte
      Arthure":
        "There come in at the fyrste course, before the kyng seluene,
        Bare hevedys that ware bryghte, burnyste with sylver,
        Alle with taghte mene and towne in togers fulle ryche."--(p. 15.)
      The word towne (well-behaved) still exists in wan-ton, the
      original meaning of which was ill-mannered, ill-bred.

1909  bray hounde3 = braþ hounde3, i.e. fierce hounds.

1995  He hat3 nere þat he so3t = He wat3 nere þat he so3t = He was near to
      that which he sought.

2160  gedere3 þe rake = takes the path or way.

2167    Þe skwe3 of þe scowtes skayued hym þo3t.
      The shadows of the hills appeared wild (desolate) to him. Sir F.
      Madden reads skayned, of which he gives no explanation.
      Skayued = skayfed, seems to be the N. Prov. English scafe, wild.
      Scotch schaivie, wild, mad. O.N. skeifr. Sw. skef, awry, distorted.

2204  ronge = clattered.

2211    Drede dot3 me no lote =
        No noise shall cause me to dread (fear).

2357    & þer-for þat tappe ta þe.
        And therefore take thee that tap.
      ta þe = take thee. Sir F. Madden reads taþe = taketh. See l. 413,
      where to þe rhymes with sothe. We have no imperatives in th in
      this poem.

2401  We schyn reuel, etc. Sir F. Madden reads wasch yn reuel.
      But schyn = shall. See Glossary to "Alliterative Poems."

2474  on-coolde = on-colde = coldly = sorrowfully.

2489  in-sounde = soundly, well. Cf. in-blande = together;
      in-lyche, alike; inmydde3, amidst.
