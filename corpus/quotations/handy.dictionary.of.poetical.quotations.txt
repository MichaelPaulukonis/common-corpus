PREFACE.


It has been the aim of the compiler of this little book to present a
Dictionary of Poetical Quotations which will be a ready reference to
many of the most familiar stanzas and lines of the chief poets of the
English language, with a few selections from Continental writers; and
also some less familiar selections from more modern poets, which may in
time become classic, or which at least have a contemporary interest.
Readers of English literature are aware that the few great poets of our
language have struck perhaps every chord of human sentiment capable of
illustration in verse, and even these few have borrowed the ideas, and
sometimes almost the exact words, of predecessors or contemporaries.

But often old ideas in a new dress are welcome to readers who might not
have been attracted by the old forms; and each generation has its
peculiar modes of expression if not its new lines of thought. It is
hoped that this mingling of the old and the new will not be without
interest. To carry out the plan of making this a "handy" dictionary of
quotations and, at the same time, as comprehensive as the space
permitted, it has been necessary to confine the illustration of the
topics selected to brief extracts from each author. Of course, in all
books of quotations the great name of Shakespeare fills the largest
space; and the compiler of this book, as well as all students of
Shakespeare, is under obligation to the painstaking compilers of the
concordances to this poet, and especially to Mr. Bartlett's monumental
work. To many other compilers of quotations, especially to the _Poetical
Quotations_ Anna L. Ward (published by Messrs. T.Y. Crowell & Co.),
the author is under obligations; while he has made an independent
examination of the more recent poets, as well as many of the older ones.
The topics illustrated number 2138, selected from the writings of 255
authors. The indexes, which will be found full and complete, were
prepared by Mrs. Grace E. Powers, who has also rendered valuable
assistance in preparing the copy for the press and in reading the
proofs.

Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
37
SHAKS.: _As You Like It,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

There affectation, with a sickly mien,
Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen;

On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,
Wrapt in a gown, for sickness, and for show.
45
POPE: _R. of the Lock,_ Canto iv., Line 31.

But wonder how the devil they got there.
73
POPE: _Epis. to Arbuthnot,_ Line 169.

74
SHAKS.: _Henry VIII.,_ Act iii, Sc. 2.

To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,

With fervency drew up.
89
SHAKS.: _Ant. and Cleo.,_ Act ii., Sc. 5.


=Anticipation.=

Peace, brother, be not over-exquisite
To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;

What need a man forestall his date of grief,
And run to meet what he would most avoid?
90
MILTON: _Comus,_ Line 359.

Of hoar antiquity, but strewn with flowers.

124
GAY: _Fables, The Elephant and the Bookseller._

But as things wip'd out with a sponge do perish.
125
SPENSER: _Ruins of Time,_ St. 52.


=Authority.=

               Man, proud man,

As make the angels weep!
126
SHAKS.: _M. for M.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness!
Close bosom friend of the maturing sun;

To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core.

One leg, as if suspicious of his brother,
Desirous seems to run away from t'other.

Gave signal sweet in that old hall,

=Banishment.=

Eating the bitter bread of banishment.
138
SHAKS.: _Richard II.,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

                  Banished?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: How hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word--banished?
139
SHAKS.: _Rom. and Jul.,_ Act iii., Sc. 3


=Banner.=

Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
140

And charge with all thy chivalry.
142
CAMPBELL: _Hohenlinden._

Be that blind bard who on the Chian strand,
By those deep sounds possessed with inward light,
Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssey
Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea.

Stone walls do not a prison make,
  Nor iron bars a cage.

            Since Cleopatra died,
I have lived in such dishonor that the gods
Detest my baseness.
145
SHAKS.: _Ant. and Cleo.,_ Act iv., Sc. 14.


=Bashfulness.=

I pity bashful men, who feel the pain
Of fancied scorn, and undeserv'd disdain,
And bear the marks upon a blushing face,
Of needless shame, and self-impos'd disgrace.
146
COWPER: _Conversation,_ Line 347.


=Battle.=

            Then more fierce
The conflict grew; the din of arms, the yell
Of savage rage, the shriek of agony,
The groan of death, commingled in one sound
Of undistinguish'd horrors.
147
SOUTHEY: _Madoc,_ Pt. ii., _The Battle._

For freedom's battle, once begun,
Bequeath'd by bleeding sire to son,
Though baffled oft, is ever won.

When the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.

  Tell their beads in drops of rain.

152
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iv., Sc. 5.

A sudden view it would beguile;
The upper part thereof was whey;
The nether, orange mix'd with grey.
153
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. i., Canto i., Line 241.


=Beast.=

A beast, that wants discourse of reason.
154
SHAKS.; _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 2.


=Beauty.=

          My beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise;
Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues.
155
SHAKS.: _Love's L. Lost,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good;
A shining gloss that fadeth suddenly;
A flower that dies, when first it 'gins to bud;
A brittle glass that's broken presently;
A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,
Lost, faded, broken, dead within an hour.
156
SHAKS.: _Pass. Pilgrim,_ St. 11

          Beauty stands
In the admiration only of weak minds
Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes
Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy,
At every sudden slighting quite abash'd.
157
MILTON: _Par. Regained,_ Bk. ii., Line 220.

Old as I am, for ladies' love unfit,
The power of beauty I remember yet.
158
DRYDEN: _Cym. and Iph.,_ Line 1.

A thing of beauty is a joy forever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
159
KEATS: _Endymion,_ Bk. i., Line 1.

What is this thought or thing
Which I call beauty? is it thought or thing?
Is it a thought accepted for a thing?
Or both? or neither--a pretext?--a word?
160
MRS. BROWNING: _Drama of Ex. Extrem. of Sword-Glare._

If eyes were made for seeing,
Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.
161
EMERSON: _The Rhodora._

Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare,
And beauty draws us with a single hair.
162
POPE: _R. of the Lock,_ Canto ii., Line 27.

True beauty dwells in deep retreats,
  Whose veil is unremoved
Till heart with heart in concord beats,
  And the lover is beloved.
163
WORDSWORTH: _To ----. Let Other Bards of Angels Sing._


=Bed.=

In bed we laugh, in bed we cry,

The moan of doves in immemorial elms,
And murmuring of innumerable bees.

Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
170
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. i., Line 500.


=Bells.=

Those evening bells! those evening bells!
How many a tale their music tells
Of youth, and home, and that sweet time,
When last I heard their soothing chime!
171
MOORE: _Those Evening Bells._

Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky!

Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
    Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
    Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.

Ring in the valiant man and free,
    The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
    Ring out the darkness of the land,
Ring in the Christ that is to be.
172
TENNYSON: _In Memoriam,_ Pt. cv.

      Hear the mellow wedding bells,
              Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!

Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

You call them thieves and pillagers; but know
They are the winged wardens of your farms,
Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe,
And from your harvests keep a hundred harms.
177
LONGFELLOW: _Birds of Killingworth,_ St. 19.


=Birth.=

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The soul that rises with us our life's star,
        Hath had elsewhere its setting,
          And cometh from afar.
178
WORDSWORTH: _Intimations of Immortality,_ St. 5.

While man is growing, life is in decrease;
And cradles rock us nearer to the tomb.
Our birth is nothing but our death begun.
179
YOUNG: _Night Thoughts,_ Night v., Line 717.


=Birthday.=

A birthday:--and now a day that rose
With much of hope, with meaning rife--
A thoughtful day from dawn to close:

=Blasphemy.=

Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them;
But, in the less, foul profanation.
       *       *       *       *       *
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
182
SHAKS.: _M. for M.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.


=Bleakness.=

A naked house, a naked moor,
A shivering pool before the door,
A garden bare of flowers and fruit,
And poplars at the garden foot:
Such is the place that I live in,
Bleak without and bare within.
183
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: _The House Beautiful._


=Blessings.=

How blessings brighten as they take their flight!
184
YOUNG: _Night Thoughts,_ Night ii., Line 602.

For blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds,
And though a late, a sure reward succeeds.
185
CONGREVE: _Mourning Bride,_ Act v., Sc. 12.


=Blindness.=

O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon;
Irrecoverably dark! total eclipse,
Without all hope of day.
186
MILTON: _Samson Agonistes,_ Line 80.

O, loss of sight, of thee I most complain!
Blind among enemies, O worse than chains,
Dungeons, or beggary, or decrepit age!
Light, the prime work of God, to me 's extinct,
And all her various objects of delight
Annul'd, which might in part my grief have eas'd,

That bliss which only centres in the mind.

When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows.

  The lover rooted stays.

Blood is a juice of very special kind.

Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on.
195
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.


=Blushing.=

Girls blush, sometimes, because they are alive,
Half wishing they were dead to save the shame.
The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow;
They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats,
And flare up boldly, wings and all.
What then?
Who's sorry for a gnat ... or girl?
196
MRS. BROWNING: _Aurora Leigh,_ Bk. ii., Line 732.


=Boasting.=

          Here's a large mouth, indeed,

As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs.
197
SHAKS.: _King John,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Oh swiftly glides the bonnie boat;
  Just parted from the shore,
And to the fisher's chorus-note
  Soft moves the dipping oar.

But know, that nothing can so foolish be
As empty boldness.

A book! O rare one!
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
Nobler than that it covers.
203
SHAKS.: _Cymbeline,_ Act v., Sc. 4.

          That place that does contain
My books, the best companions, is to me
A glorious court, where hourly I converse
With the old sages and philosophers;
And sometimes, for variety, I confer
With kings and emperors, and weigh their counsels.
204
BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER: _The Elder Brother,_ Act i., Sc. 2.

Books cannot always please, however good;
Minds are not ever craving for their food.
205
CRABBE: _The Borough,_ Letter xxiv.

Are a substantial world, both pure and good;
Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,
Our pastime and our happiness will grow.

Deep vers'd in books, and shallow in himself.

Too well I know the boding sound
  That ushers in a bore.
210
J.G. SAXE: _My Familiar._


=Borrowing.=

Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all,--to thine own self be true;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
211
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 3.

          For his bounty,
There was no winter in 't; an autumn 't was,
That grew the more by reaping.
215
SHAKS.: _Ant. and Cleo.,_ Act v., Sc. 2

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
   Heaven did a recompense as largely send;

  He gain'd from Heav'n ('t was all he wish'd) a friend.
216

The words of love then spoken.

222
BURNS: _Auld Lang Syne._


=Braggart.=

            I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple:
Scrambling, outfacing, fashion-monging boys,
That lie, and cog, and flout, deprave, and slander,
Go anticly, and show outward hideousness,
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
How they might hurt their enemies if they durst;
And this is all.
223
SHAKS.: _Much Ado,_ Act v., Sc. 1.


=Brains.=

            The times have been
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools.
224
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.


=Bravery.=

   Are so queer!
233
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES: _The Last Leaf._


=Breezes.=

          Breezes of the South!
Who toss the golden and the flame-like flowers,
And pass the prairie-hawk that, poised on high,
Flaps his broad wings, yet moves not--ye have played
Among the palms of Mexico and vines
Of Texas, and have crisped the limpid brooks
That from the fountains of Sonora glide
Into the calm Pacific--have ye fanned
A nobler or a lovelier scene than this?
234
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT: _The Prairies._


=Brevity.=

          Since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes--

When we are, or are not, understood.

=Bribes.=

              What! shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world,
But for supporting robbers;--shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I'd rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
237
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act iv., Sc. 3.

You are just a sweet bride in her bloom,
All sunshine, and snowy, and pure.

The hand that rounded Peter's dome,
And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,
Wrought in a sad sincerity;
Himself from God he could not free;
He builded better than he knew:
The conscious stone to beauty grew.
247
EMERSON: _The Problem._


=Burden.=

A sacred burden is this life ye bear:
Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly,
Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly.

Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

The bed was made, the room was fit,

When we put up, my ass and I,
At God's green caravanserai.

=Captain.=

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won.

While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring.
    But O heart! heart! heart!

        Where on the deck my Captain lies,
          Fallen cold and dead.

Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
400

T.B. ALDRICH: _Coquette._


=Corruption.=

Corruption is a tree, whose branches are
Of an unmeasurable length: they spread
Ev'rywhere; and the dew that drops from thence
Hath infected some chairs and stools of authority.
408
BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER: _Hon. Man's For.,_ Act iii., Sc. 3

At length corruption, like a general flood,
(So long by watchful ministers withstood,)
Shall deluge all; and avarice creeping on,
Spread like a low-born mist, and blot the sun.
409
POPE: _Moral Essays,_ Epis. iii., Line 135.

          Bosom up my counsel,
You'll find it wholesome.

Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,
Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.
411
POPE: _R. of the Lock,_ Canto iii., Line 7.


=Country.=

God made the country, and man made the town;
What wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts,
That can alone make sweet the bitter draught
That life holds out to all, should most abound,
And least be threatened in the fields and groves?
412
COWPER: _Task,_ Bk. i., Line 749.

True patriots all; for be it understood
We left our country for our country's good.
413
GEORGE BARRINGTON: _Prologue written for
the Opening of the Playhouse at New South
Wales, Jan. 16, 1796._


=Courage.=

            What man dare, I dare.
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcanian tiger.
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble.
414
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

I dare do all that may become a man:
Who dares do more is none.
415
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act i., Sc. 7.

            No thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
That argued fear; each on himself relied,
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory.
416
MILTON, _Par. Lost,_ Bk. vi., Line 236.


=Court--Courtiers.=

The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
Whom I have soon to weed and pluck away.
417
SHAKS.: _Richard II.,_ Act ii., Sc. 3.

          Not a courtier,
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the king's looks, hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at.
418
SHAKS.: _Cymbeline,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

          A mere court butterfly,
That flutters in the pageant of a monarch.
419
BYRON: _Sardanapalus,_ Act v., Sc. 1.


=Courtesy.=

How sweet and gracious, even in common speech,
Is that fine sense which men call Courtesy!
Wholesome as air and genial as the light,
Welcome in every clime as breath of flowers,--
It transmutes aliens into trusting friends,
And gives its owner passport round the globe.
420
JAMES T. FIELDS: _Courtesy._


=Courtship.=

Bring, therefore, all the forces that you may,
And lay incessant battery to her heart;
Plaints, prayers, vows, ruth, and sorrow, and dismay,--
These engines can the proudest love convert.
421
SPENSER: _Amoretti and Epithalamion,_ Sonnet xiv.

She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
She is a woman, therefore may be won.
422
SHAKS.: _Titus And.,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

He that would win his dame must do
As love does when he draws his bow;
With one hand thrust the lady from,
And with the other pull her home.
423
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. ii., Canto i., Line 449.


=Covetousness.=

When workmen strive to do better than well,
They do confound their skill in covetousness.
424
SHAKS.: _King John,_ Act iv., Sc. 2.


=Cowardice.=

O, that a mighty man, of such descent,
Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
425
SHAKS.: _Tam. of the S.,_ Introduction, Sc. 2.

Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
426
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

The man that lays his hand upon a woman,
Save in the way of kindness, is a wretch
Whom 't were gross flattery to name a coward.

The coward never on himself relies,
But to an equal for assistance flies.
428
CRABBE: Tale iii., Line 84.


=Cowslips.=

With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,
And every flower that sad embroidery wears.
429
MILTON: _Lycidas,_ Line 139.


=Coxcombs.=

So by false learning is good sense defac'd;
Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,
And some made coxcombs, nature meant but fools.
430
POPE: _E. on Criticism,_ Pt. i., Line 25.

And coxcombs vanquish Berkeley by a grin.
431
JOHN BROWN: _An Essay on Satire._

Me let the tender office long engage
To rock the cradle of reposing age.
432
POPE: _Prologue to the Satires,_ Line 408.


=Craftiness.=

That for ways that are dark
And for tricks that are vain,
The heathen Chinee is peculiar.
433
BRET HARTE: _Plain Language from Truthful James._


=Creation.=

Creation sleeps! 'T is as the general pulse
Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause,--
An awful pause! prophetic of her end.
434
YOUNG: _Night Thoughts,_ Night i., Line 23.


=Credit.=

Bless paper credit! last and best supply!
That lends corruption lighter wings to fly.
435
POPE: _Moral Essays,_ Epis. iii., Line 39.


=Creed.=

Shall I ask the brave soldier who fights by my side
In the cause of mankind, if our creeds agree?
Shall I give up the friend I have valued and tried,
If he kneel not before the same altar with me?
436
MOORE: _Come, Send Round the Wine._


=Crime.=

Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion, all the interim is
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream.
437
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

          One murder made a villain,
Millions a hero. Princes were privileged
To kill, and numbers sanctified the crime.
438
BEILBY PORTEUS: _Death,_ Line 154.


=Criticism--Critics.=

I am nothing if not critical.
439
SHAKS.: _Othello,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

Critics I saw, that other names deface,
And fix their own, with labor, in their place.
440
POPE: _Temple of Fame,_ Line 37.


=Cromwell.=

Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud,
Not of war only, but detractions rude,
Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plough'd.
441
MILTON: _Sonnets, To the Lord General Cromwell._


=Cross.=

          The moon of Mahomet
          Arose, and it shall set;
While, blazoned as on heaven's immortal noon,
          The cross leads generations on.
442
SHELLEY: _Hellas,_ Line 221.


=Crowd.=

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray.

Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe.
444
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

          What seem'd his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
Satan was now at hand.
445

A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
Uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.
446
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.


=Cupid.=

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
447
SHAKS.: _Mid. N. Dream,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

Cupid is a casuist,
A mystic, and a cabalist,--
Can your lurking thought surprise,
And interpret your device....
Heralds high before him run;
He has ushers many a one;
He spreads his welcome where he goes,
And touches all things with his rose.
All things wait for and divine him,--
How shall I dare to malign him?
448
EMERSON: _Daem. and Celes., Love,_ Pt. i.


=Cure.=

                      'T is an ill cure
For life's worst ills, to have no time to feel them.
449
SIR HENRY TAYLOR: _Philip Van Artevelde,_ Pt. i., Act i., Sc. 5.


=Curfew.=

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
  The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
450
GRAY: _Elegy,_ St. 1.


=Curiosity.=

I loathe that low vice, curiosity.
451

The stamp of fate, and sanction of the god.

Or lose our ventures.
453

=Curses.=

            Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar.
454
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

                But in their stead
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
455
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act v., Sc. 3.

It was that fatal and perfidious bark,
Built in th' eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark.
456
MILTON: _Lycidas,_ Line 100.


=Custom.=

How use doth breed a habit in a man!
457
SHAKS.: _Two Gent. of V.,_ Act v., Sc. 4.

        Custom calls me to 't;--
What custom wills, in all things should we do 't?
458
SHAKS.: _Coriolanus,_ Act ii., Sc. 3.

Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this.

=Cypress.=

Dark tree! still sad when others' grief is fled,
The only constant mourner o'er the dead.

Fair daffadills, we weep to see
  You haste away so soon:
As yet the early rising sun
  Has not attained his noon.
461
HERRICK: _To Daffadills._


=Dagger.=

Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand?...
                  or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
462
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act ii., Sc. 1

Alike all ages: dames of ancient days
Have led their children through the mirthful maze:
And the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,
Has frisk'd beneath the burden of threescore.
466
GOLDSMITH: _Traveller,_ Line 251.

Her feet beneath her petticoat,
Like little mice, stole in and out,
  As if they feared the light;
But, oh! she dances such a way!
No sun upon an Easter-day
  Is half so fine a sight.
467
SUCKLING: _On a Wedding._

Come and trip it as you go
On the light fantastic toe.
468
MILTON: _L'Allegro,_ Line 33.

On with the dance! let joy be unconfined!
No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet,
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.
469

You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
  Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
470
BYRON: _Don Juan,_ Canto iii., St. 86. 10.


=Danger.=

He that stands upon a slippery place,
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.
471
SHAKS.: _King John,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

Out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.

Nor thought of tender happiness betray.

Oh their Dante of the dread Inferno,
Wrote one song--and in my brain I sing it.

I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.
475
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act i., Sc. 7

The bravest are the tenderest,--
The loving are the daring.
476
BAYARD TAYLOR: _The Song of the Camp._


=Darkness.=

Lo! darkness bends down like a mother of grief
On the limitless plain, and the fall of her hair
It has mantled a world.
477
JOAQUIN MILLER: _From Sea to Sea,_ St. 4.

Thy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall,
And universal darkness buries all.
478
POPE: _Dunciad,_ Bk. iv., Line 649.


=Dart.=

Th' adorning thee with so much art
  Is but a barb'rous skill;
'Tis like the pois'ning of a dart,
  Too apt before to kill.
479
ABRAHAM COWLEY: _The Waiting Maid._


=Daughter.=

Still harping on my daughter.
480
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

                The morning steals upon the night,
Melting the darkness.

The day begins to break, and night is fled,
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
483
SHAKS.: _1 Henry VI.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Clothing the palpable and familiar
With golden exhalations of the dawn.
484
COLERIDGE: _Death of Wallenstein,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Day, Days.=

At the close of the day when the hamlet is still,
And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove,
When naught but the torrent is heard on the hill,
And naught but the nightingale's song in the grove.
485
BEATTIE: _The Hermit._

My days are in the yellow leaf;
  The flowers and fruits of love are gone;
The worm, the canker, and the grief
  Are mine alone!
486
BYRON: _On my Thirty-sixth Year._

One of those heavenly days that cannot die.
487
WORDSWORTH: _Nutting._


=Death.=

Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come, when it will come.
488
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Kings and mightiest potentates must die,
For that's the end of human misery.

Death lies on her, like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

    Behind her death,
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
On his pale horse.
492
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. x., Line 588.

Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
Come to the mother's, when she feels,
For the first time, her first-born's breath;
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet song, and dance, and wine;
And thou art terrible,--the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony are thine.
493
FITZ-GREENE HALLECK: _Marco Bozzaris._

Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow.

To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.

MACAULAY: _Lays Anc. Rome, Horatius,_ xxvii.

Leaves have their times to fall,
And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath,
And stars to set--but all,
Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O death.
496
MRS. HEMANS: _Hour of Death._

Death is only kind to mortals.
497
SCHILLER: _Complaint of Ceres,_ St. 4.

What a strange, delicious amazement is Death,
To be without body and breathe without breath.
498
EDWIN ARNOLD: _She and He._

There is no Death! What seems so is transition;
  This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
  Whose portal we call death.
499
LONGFELLOW: _Resignation,_ St. 5.

Our days begin with trouble here,
  Our life is but a span,
And cruel death is always near,
  So frail a thing is man.
500

Death rides on every passing breeze,
  He lurks in every flower.
501
HEBER: _At a Funeral,_ No. i.

How wonderful is Death!
Death and his brother Sleep.
502
SHELLEY: _Queen Mab,_ St. i.

And Death is beautiful as feet of friend
Coming with welcome at our journey's end.

Death in itself is nothing; but we fear
To be we know not what, we know not where.
504
DRYDEN: _Aurengzebe,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

You say, you nothing owe; and so I say:
He only owes, who something hath to pay.
505
MARTIAL: (_Hay_), ii., 3.


=Decay.=

Before decay's effacing fingers
Have swept the lines where beauty lingers.
506

The ruins of himself! now worn away
With age, yet still majestic in decay.

O, what a tangled web we weave,
When first we practise to deceive.
509
SCOTT: _Marmion,_ Canto vi., St. 17


=December.=

And after him came next the chill December:
Yet he, through merry feasting which he made
And great bonfires, did not the cold remember;
His Saviour's birth his mind so much did glad.
510
SPENSER: _Faerie Queene,_ Bk. vii., Canto vii., St. 41.

=Decision.=

If it were done, when 't is done, then 't were well
It were done quickly.
513
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act i., Sc. 7.

Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight,
Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right;
And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.
514
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL: _Present Crisis._


=Deeds.=

                And with necessity,
The tyrant's plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.
515
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iv., Line 393.

              Oh! 't is easy
To beget great deeds; but in the rearing of them--
The threading in cold blood each mean detail,
And furze brake of half-pertinent circumstance--
There lies the self-denial.
516
CHARLES KINGSLEY: _Saint's Tragedy,_ Act iv., Sc. 3.


=Deep.=

Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies,
Methinks her patient sons before me stand,
Where the broad ocean leans against the land.

              Such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep,
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
Confusion worse confounded.

What boots it at one gate to make defence,
And at another to let in the foe?
520
MILTON: _Samson Agonistes,_ Line 560.


=Defiance.=

I do defy him, and I spit at him;
Call him a slanderous coward, and a villain:
Which to maintain, I would allow him odds;
And meet him, were I tied to run a-foot,
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps.
521
SHAKS.: _Richard II.,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Deity.=

Hail, source of being! universal soul
Of heaven and earth! essential presence, hail!

Continual, climb; who, with a master hand,
Hast the great whole into perfection touch'd.
522

As high as we have mounted in delight,
In our dejection do we sink as low.

=Delay.=

Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary.

=Deliberation.=

               Deep on his front engraven,
Deliberation sat, and public care.
526
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. ii., Line 300.

She was a phantom of delight
When first she gleamed upon my sight,
A lovely apparition, sent
To be a moment's ornament.
527
WORDSWORTH: _She was a Phantom of Delight._


=Delusion.=

                For love of grace,
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
That not your trespass but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place.
Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen.
528
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.


=Denmark.=

Something is rotten in the State of Denmark.
529
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 4.


=Deportment.=

What's a fine person, or a beauteous face,
Unless deportment gives them decent grace?
Blest with all other requisites to please,
Some want the striking elegance of ease;
The curious eye their awkward movement tires;
They seem like puppets led about by wires.
530
CHURCHILL: _Rosciad,_ Line 741.


=Depravity.=

God's love seemed lost upon him.
531

In the cold grave, under the deep, deep sea,
Or in the wide desert where no life is found.

  Are rapture to the dreary void,
The leafless desert of the mind,
  The waste of feelings unemployed.

=Desire (Love).=

It liveth not in fierce desire,
  With dead desire it doth not die.
535
SCOTT: _Lay of the Last Minstrel,_ Canto v., St. 13.


=Desolation.=

Desolate! Life is so dreary and desolate.
Women and men in the crowd meet and mingle,
Yet with itself every soul standeth single,
Deep out of sympathy moaning its moan;
Holding and having its brief exultation;
Making its lonesome and low lamentation;
Fighting its terrible conflicts alone.
536
ALICE CARY: _Life._


=Despair.=

Despair defies even despotism; there is
That in my heart would make its way thro' hosts
With levell'd spears.
537
BYRON: _Two Foscari,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

              Then black despair,
The shadow of a starless night, was thrown
Over the world in which I moved alone.

That fought in heaven, now fiercer by despair.
539

Needs no explanations. The heart reads aright
Its destiny sometimes.

Where'er she lie,
Locked up from mortal eye,
In shady leaves of destiny.

I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape,
And bid me hold my peace.

Happy are they that hear their detractions,
And can put them to mending.

At every word a reputation dies.

Till he forgets his loves or debts,
An' minds his griefs no more.

And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity!

  In every clime adored,
By saint, by savage, and by sage,
  Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.
685
POPE: _The Universal Prayer,_ St. 1.


=Fault--Faults.=

Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it?
686
SHAKS.: _M. for M.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Dare to be true: nothing can need a lie;
A fault which needs it most, grows two thereby.
687
HERBERT: _The Church Porch._

In vain my faults ye quote;
I write as others wrote
  On Sunium's hight.
688
WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR: _The Last Fruit of an Old Tree,_ Epigram cvi.


=Favor.=

          Poor wretches, that depend
On greatness' favor, dream as I have done;

Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
And yet are steep'd in favors.

=Fawning.=

And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee,
Where thrift may follow fawning.
690
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.

          Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
And, for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
691
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 4.

Of all base passions fear is most accurs'd.
692
SHAKS.: _1 Henry VI.,_ Act v., Sc. 2.

Desponding fear, of feeble fancies full,
Weak and unmanly, loosens ev'ry power.
693
THOMSON: _Seasons, Spring,_ Line 286.

The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip
  To hand the wretch in order;
But where ye feel your honor grip,
  Let that aye be your border.
694
BURNS: _Ep. to a Young Friend._


=Feasting.=

Blest be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd,
Where all the ruddy family around
Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail,
Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale.
695
GOLDSMITH: _Traveller,_ Line 17.

                        Swinish gluttony
Ne'er looks to heav'n amidst his gorgeous feast,
But with besotted base ingratitude
Crams, and blasphemes his feeder.
696
MILTON: _Comus,_ Line 776.


=February.=

                    Come when the rains
Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice,
While the slant sun of February pours
Into the bowers a flood of light.

Female of sex it seems.
701
MILTON: _Samson Agonistes,_ Line 710.

Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!
Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
And fickle as a changeful dream.
702
SCOTT: _Lady of the Lake,_ Canto v., St. 10.


=Fiction.=

When fiction rises pleasing to the eye,
Men will believe, because they love the lie;
But truth herself, if clouded with a frown,
Must have some solemn proof to pass her down.
703
CHURCHILL: _Epis. to Hogarth,_ Line 291.

And truth severe, by fairy fiction drest.

Like one that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head,
Because he knows a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.

COLERIDGE: _The Ancient Mariner,_ Pt. v.


=Fighting.=

I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.

He who fights and runs away,
May live to fight another day;
But he who is in battle slain
Can never rise and fight again.
710
GOLDSMITH: _Art of Poetry._


=Fire.=

From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine,

Periods of time; thence hurried back to fire.

                 Now glow'd the firmament
With living sapphires.

And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
Their great Original proclaim.

Th' unconquerable mind, and freedom's holy flame.

The flame that lit the battle's wreck
  Shone round him o'er the dead.
717
HEMANS: _Casablanca._


=Flattery.=

By heav'n I cannot flatter: I do defy
The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
In my heart's love, hath no man than yourself;
Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
718
SHAKS.: _1 Henry IV.,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

'Tis an old maxim in the schools,
That flattery 's the food of fools;
Yet, now and then, your men of wit
Will condescend to take a bit.
719
SWIFT: _Cadenus and Vanessa,_ Line 755.

Can honor's voice provoke the silent dust,
  Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?
720
GRAY: _Elegy,_ St. 11.

So, naturalists observe, a flea
Has smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller still to bite 'em;
And so proceed _ad infinitum._
721
SWIFT: _Poetry, A Rhapsody._

Never wedding, ever wooing,
Still a love-lorn heart pursuing,

In my cheek's pale hue?
All my life with sorrow strewing,
Wed, or cease to woo.
723

Flowers preach to us if we will hear.
726
CHRIS. G. ROSSETTI: _Consider the Lilies of the Field._

In Eastern lands they talk in flowers,
And they tell in a garland their loves and cares;
Each blossom that blooms in their garden bowers
On its leaves a mystic language bears.

J.G. PERCIVAL: _Language of the Flowers._


Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost.
728
COLERIDGE: _Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._

Save, save, oh save me from the _candid friend_!
729
GEORGE CANNING: _New Morality._


=Folly.=

            Fools, to talking ever prone,
Are sure to make their follies known.
730
GAY: _Fables,_ Pt. i., Fable 44.

Whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it,
If folly grow romantic, I must paint it.
731
POPE: _Moral Essays,_ Epis. ii., Line 15.

Where lives the man that has not tried
How mirth can into folly glide,
  And folly into sin!
732
SCOTT: _Bridal of Triermain,_ Canto i., St. 21.

When lovely woman stoops to folly,
  And finds too late that men betray,
What charm can soothe her melancholy?
  What art can wash her guilt away?
733
GOLDSMITH: _The Hermit,_ Ch. xxiv.


=Fools.=

Fools are my theme, let satire be my song.
734

The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown.
735
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iii., Line 495.

By force, hath overcome but half his foe.

=Forest.=

Summer or winter, day or night,
The woods are an ever-new delight;

Such wonderful balms to them belong:
So, living or dying, I'll take mine ease
Under the trees, under the trees.
741
R.H. STODDARD: _Under the Trees._

This is the forest primeval.
742
LONGFELLOW: _Evangeline,_ Introduction.

  Not in entire forgetfulness,
  And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory, do we come
  From God, who is our home.
743
WORDSWORTH: _Intimations of Immortality._

God of our fathers, known of old--
  Lord of our far-flung battle line--
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
  Dominion over palm and pine--
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget--lest we forget.
744

They who forgive most shall be most forgiven.
746
BAILEY: _Festus,_ Sc. _Home._

She was a form of life and light
That seen, became a part of sight,

The morning-star of memory!
748
BYRON: _Giaour,_ Line 1127.


=Fortitude.=

True fortitude is seen in great exploits
That justice warrants, and that wisdom guides;
All else is tow'ring frenzy and distraction.
749
ADDISON: _Cato,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.


=Fortune.=

Will fortune never come with both hands full,
But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
She either gives a stomach, and no food,--
Such as are the poor in health; or else a feast,
And takes away the stomach,--such are the rich,
That have abundance, and enjoy it not.
750
SHAKS.: _2 Henry IV.,_ Act iv., Sc. 4.

Fortune is female: from my youth her favors
Were not withheld, the fault was mine to hope
Her former smiles again at this late hour.
751
BYRON: _Mar. Faliero,_ Act v., Sc. 1.

Forever, Fortune, wilt thou prove
An unrelenting foe to love;
And when we meet a mutual heart,
Come in between and bid us part?
752
THOMSON: _Song._


=Frailty.=

Frailty, thy name is Woman!
753
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 2.

Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
His soul and body to their lasting rest.
754
SHAKS.: _King John,_ Act v., Sc. 7.


=France.=

'Tis better using France, than trusting France;
Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas,
Which he hath given for fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defend ourselves;
In them, and in ourselves, our safety lies.
755
SHAKS.: _3 Henry VI.,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.


=Fraternity.=

There are bonds of all sorts in this world of ours,
Fetters of friendship and ties of flowers,
  And true-lovers' knots, I ween;
The girl and the boy are bound by a kiss,
But there 's never a bond, old friend, like this,
  We have drunk from the same canteen.
756
CHARLES G. HALPINE ("MILES O'REILLY"): _The Canteen._


=Freedom.=

We must be free or die, who speak the tongue
That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold
Which Milton held.
757
WORDSWORTH: _Sonnet. It is not to be thought of, etc._

Oh, FREEDOM! thou art not, as poets dream,
A fair young girl, with light and delicate limbs,
And wavy tresses gushing from the cap
With which the Roman master crowned his slave
When he took off the gyves. A bearded man,
Armed to the teeth, art thou; one mailèd hand
Grasps the broad shield, and one the sword; thy brow,
Glorious in beauty though it be, is scarred
With tokens of old wars.
758
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT: _Antiquity of Freedom._

My angel,--his name is Freedom,--
Choose him to be your king;
He shall cut pathways east and west,
And fend you with his wing.
759
EMERSON: _Boston Hymn._

Then Freedom sternly said: "I shun
No strife nor pang beneath the sun,
When human rights are staked and won."
760
WHITTIER: _The Watchers._

When Freedom from her mountain-height
  Unfurled her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of night,
  And set the stars of glory there.

He is the freeman whom the truth makes free.
762

=Friendship.=

I count myself in nothing else so happy,
As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends.
763
SHAKS.: _Richard II.,_ Act ii., Sc. 3.

The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd unfledged comrade.
764
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 3.

Oh, be my friend, and teach me to be thine!
765
EMERSON: _Forbearance._

    The friendships of the world are oft
Confederacies in vice, or leagues of pleasure.
766
ADDISON: _Cato,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspir'd.
767
POPE: _Iliad,_ Bk. xvi., Line 267.

Officious, innocent, sincere,
Of every friendless name the friend.
768
DR. JOHNSON: _Verses on the Death of Mr, Robert Levet,_ St. 2.

Small service is true service while it lasts.
Of humblest friends, bright creature! scorn not one:
The daisy, by the shadow that it casts,
Protects the lingering dewdrop from the sun.
769
WORDSWORTH: _To a Child._


=Front.=

His fair large front and eye sublime declar'd
Absolute rule.
770

=Frost.=

    All the panes are hung with frost,
Wild wizard-work of silver lace.

T.B. ALDRICH: _Latakia._

What miracle of weird transforming
Is this wild work of frost and light,
This glimpse of glory infinite!

  That nipt my flower sae early.

Beware the fury of a patient man.
776
DRYDEN: _Absalom and Achitophel,_ Pt. i., Line 1005.


=Futurity.=

The dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will;
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of.
777
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

    O Death, O Beyond,
Thou art sweet, thou art strange!
778
MRS. BROWNING: _Rhapsody of Life's Progress._

Ah Christ, that it were possible
For one short hour to see
The souls we loved, that they might tell us
What and where they be.

Trust no future, howe'er pleasant!
Let the dead Past bury its dead!

Unvex'd with all the cares of gain.

Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale.
783
BURNS: _The Cotter's Saturday Night._

Perhaps his wife's too, and whom she hath bore.

                  A garden, sir,

COWLEY: _The Garden,_ Essay v.


=Garret.=

Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred.
787
BYRON: _A Sketch._


=Garrick.=

Here lies David Garrick--describe him who can,
An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man.
As an actor, confess'd without rival to shine;
As a wit, if not first, in the very first line;
Yet, with talents like these, and an excellent heart,
The man had his failings--a dupe to his art.
Like an ill-judging beauty, his colors he spread,
And beplaster'd with rouge his own natural red.
On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting:
'Twas only that when he was off, he was acting.
788
GOLDSMITH: _Retaliation,_ Line 93.


=Gem.=

Full many a gem of purest ray serene
    The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear.

Nor mourn the unalterable Days
That Genius goes and Folly Stays.

When Adam dolve, and Eve span,
Who was then the gentleman?

More than your force move us to gentleness.
794
SHAKS.: _As You Like It,_ Act ii., Sc. 7.

Avaunt! and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,
Which thou dost glare with!
795
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

      Many ghosts, and forms of fright,
Have started from their graves to-night;
They have driven sleep from mine eyes away.
796
LONGFELLOW: _Christus, Golden Legend,_ Pt. iv.

Some say no evil thing that walks by night,
In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,
Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost
That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,
No goblin, or swart fairy of the mine,
Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity.
797
MILTON: _Comus,_ Line 432.


=Gifts.=

She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me, are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver'd.
798
SHAKS.: _Wint. Tale,_ Act iv., Sc. 3.

=Gloaming.=

Late, late in a gloamin, when all was still,
When the fringe was red on the westlin hill,
The wood was sere, the moon i' the wane,
The reek o' the cot hung over the plain--
Like a little wee cloud in the world its lane;
When the ingle lowed with an eiry leme,
Late, late in the gloamin Kilmeny came hame!
801
JAMES HOGG: _Kilmeny._


=Gloom.=

Where glowing embers through the room
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom.
802
MILTON: _Il Penseroso,_ Line 79.


=Glory.=

Glory is like a circle in the water,
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,
Till, by broad spreading, it disperse to nought.
803

    His form had yet not lost
All her original brightness, nor appear'd
Less than archangel ruin'd, and th' excess
Of glory obscur'd.

Go where glory waits thee!
But while fame elates thee,
    Oh, still remember me!

    But yet I know, where'er I go,
That there hath passed away a glory from the earth.
806
WORDSWORTH: _Intimations of Immortality,_ St. 2.

  Behold their tears and hear their cries!

And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
808
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 5.


=Gluttony.=

          Swinish gluttony
Ne'er looks to Heav'n amidst his gorgeous feast,

=God.=

'T is heaven alone that is given away,
'T is only God may be had for the asking.

JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL: _The Vision of Sir Launfal._

All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
Whose body Nature is, and God the soul.
811
POPE: _Essay on Man,_ Epis. i., Line 267.

Thou art, O God, the life and light
Of all this wondrous world we see;
Its glow by day, its smile by night,
Are but reflections caught from Thee:
Where'er we turn, Thy glories shine,
And all things fair and bright are Thine.

Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
818

O cursed lust of gold! when for thy sake
The fool throws up his interest in both worlds;
First starved in this, then damn'd in that to come.

Goodness and he fill up one monument!
821

Burn to the socket.

One grand, sweet song.

827
SHAKS.: _3 Henry VI.,_ Act 1., Sc. 4.

              Each petty hand
Can steer a ship becalm'd; but he that will
Govern and carry her to her ends, must know
His tides, his currents, how to shift his sails;
What she will bear in foul, what in fair weathers;
Where her springs are, her leaks, and how to stop 'em;
What strands, what shelves, what rooks do threaten her.
828
BEN JONSON: _Catiline,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

For forms of government let fools contest,
Whate'er is best administer'd is best.

With coldness still returning;
Alas! the gratitude of men
Hath oftener left me mourning.

All food alike for worms, companions in the grave.

          The grave, dread thing!
Men shiver when thou 'rt named: Nature appall'd,
Shakes off her wonted firmness.
836
BLAIR: _The Grave,_ Line 9.

Mine be the breezy hill that skirts the down,
Where a green grassy turf is all I crave,
With here and there a violet bestrewn,
Fast by a brook or fountain's murmuring wave;
And many an evening sun shine sweetly on my grave!

BEATTIE: _The Minstrel,_ Bk. ii., St. 17.


=Greatness.=

I have touched the highest point of all my greatness.
838
SHAKS.: _Henry VIII.,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.

            Rightly to be great,
Is, not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,
When honor's at the stake.

And run to meet what he would most avoid?
847
MILTON: _Comus,_ Line 362.

Of taking vainly, in a plaintive mood,
The holy name of GRIEF!--holy herein,
That, by the grief of ONE, came all our good.

The groves were God's first temples.
851

With such old counsellors they did advise.
And by frequenting sacred groves grew wise.

It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

Intimidates the brave, degrades the great!

Ill habits gather by unseen degrees,

Small habits well pursued betimes
May reach the dignity of crimes.

Golden hair, like sunlight streaming
On the marble of her shoulder.

          Let my hand--
This hand, lie in your own--my own true friend!
Hand in hand with you.
865
ROBERT BROWNING: _Paracelsus,_ Sc. 5.

            'T was a hand
White, delicate, dimpled, warm, languid, and bland.
The hand of a woman is often, in youth,
Somewhat rough, somewhat red, somewhat graceless in truth;
Does its beauty refine, as its pulses grow calm,
Or as Sorrow has, crossed the life-line in the palm?
866
OWEN MEREDITH: _Lucile,_ Pt. i., Canto iii., St. 13.


=Happiness.=

And there is even a happiness
That makes the heart afraid.
867
HOOD: _Ode to Melancholy._

Happiness depends, as Nature shows,
Less on exterior things than most suppose.
868

For which we bear to live, or dare to die.

Through all the compass of the notes it ran,
The diapason closing full in Man.
871
DRYDEN: _A Song for St. Cecilia's Day,_ Line 11.

That rais'd emotions both of rage and fear;
And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,
Hope withering fled, and Mercy sigh'd farewell!

The tall, the wise, the reverend head
Must lie as low as ours.
882
WATTS: _Hymns and Spiritual Songs,_ Bk. ii., Hymn 63.

Nor love, nor honor, wealth, nor power,
Can give the heart a cheerful hour

Than fee the doctor for a nauseous draught.

Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity.
887
MRS. BROWNING: _Lady Geraldine's Courtship,_ xli.

The heart bowed down by weight of woe
To weakest hope will cling.

May give a useful lesson to the head.

With less of earth in them than heaven.

'Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world.
894
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.

A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,
As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames
No light; but rather darkness visible
Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all, but torture without end.
895
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. i., Line 61.

      Hell
Grew darker at their frown.

To rest, the cushion and soft dean invite,
Who never mentions hell to ears polite.

In hope to merit heaven by making earth a hell.
898
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto i., St. 20.

And there is little or no fun done;
Small justice shown, and still less pity.

Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed,
From Macedonia's madman to the Swede.

POPE: _Essay on Man,_ Epis. iv., Line 219.

Whoe'er excels in what we prize,
Appears a hero in our eyes.
903
SWIFT: _Cadenus and Vanessa,_ Line 729.

Has won the battle for the free
Death's voice sounds like a prophet's word;
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be!

                        Home is the resort
Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,

And dear relations mingle into bliss.
913
THOMSON: _Seasons, Autumn,_ Line 65.

This fond attachment to the well-known place
Whence first we started into life's long race,
Maintains its hold with such unfailing sway,
We feel it e'en in age, and at our latest day.
914
COWPER: _Tirocinium,_ Line 314.

This be the verse you grave for me:
Here he lies where he longed to be;

And the hunter home from the hill.

'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble, there 's no place like home.

True to the kindred points of heaven and home.
917
WORDSWORTH: _To a Skylark._


=Homer.=

Read Homer once, and you can read no more,
For all books else appear so mean, so poor;
Verse may seem prose; but still persist to read,
And Homer will be all the books you need.
918
SHEFFIELD, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE: _Essay on Poetry_

Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
  That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne,
  Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold.

O, 'tis a burthen, ... 'tis a burthen,
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.

Honor travels in a strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path.
924

Honor's a fine imaginary notion,
That draws in raw and unexperienced men
To real mischiefs, while they hunt a shadow.

Honor and shame from no condition rise;
Act well your part, there all the honor lies.

So farewell hope, and, with hope, farewell fear,
Farewell remorse! All good to me is lost.

Wreaths for each toil, a charm for every woe.
933

  But earthly hope, how bright soe'er,
Still fluctuates o'er this changing scene,
  As false and fleeting as 'tis fair.

And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all.

  He dies--alas! how soon he dies!
945

For there's nae luck about the house,
  There's nae luck at a';

THOMSON: _Seasons, Winter,_ Line 393.

As the husband is, the wife is; thou art mated with a clown,

To think how monie counsels sweet,
How monie lengthened sage advices,
The husband frae the wife despises.

Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks
Invisible, except to God alone,
By His permissive will, through Heaven and Earth.

The hypocrite had left his mask, and stood
In naked ugliness. He was a man
Who stole the livery of the court of heaven
To serve the devil in.

It must be so, Plato, thou reasonest well!--
Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
This longing after immortality?
969
ADDISON: _Cato,_ Act v., Sc. 1.

              Where music dwells
Lingering and wandering on as loth to die,
Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
That they were born for immortality.

There are three things a wise man will not trust--

Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.

Ever mindful what it cost;

Ere sin could blight, or sorrow fade,
Death came with friendly care;
The opening bud to heav'n convey'd,
And bade it blossom there.
979
COLERIDGE: _Epitaph on an Infant._


=Infidelity.=

      If man loses all, when life is lost,
He lives a coward, or a fool expires.
A daring infidel (and such there are,
From pride, example, lucre, rage, revenge,
Or pure heroical defect of thought,)
Of all earth's madmen, most deserves a chain.
980
YOUNG: _Night Thoughts,_ Night vii., Line 199.

And all life not be purer and stronger thereby.

Rain influence, and judge the prize.
982

I hate ingratitude more in a man
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
Or any taint of vice, whose strong corruption
Inhabits our frail blood.

Ingratitude! thou marble-hearted fiend,
More hideous, when thou show'st thee in a child,
Than the sea-monster!

=Innocence.=

The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades, when speaking fails.

An age that melts in unperceiv'd decay,
And glides in modest innocence away.
989
DR. JOHNSON: _Van. of Human Wishes,_ Line 293.


=Instinct.=

Then vainly the philosopher avers
That reason guides our deeds, and instinct theirs.
How can we justly different causes frame,
When the effects entirely are the same?
Instinct and reason how can we divide?
'Tis the fool's ignorance, and the pedant's pride.
990
PRIOR: _Solomon on the V-of the World,_ Bk. i., Line 231.

Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
Impossible!

994
ROBERT BROWNING: _Cleon._


=Italy.=

Italia! O Italia! thou who hast
The fatal gift of beauty, which became
A funeral dower of present woes and past,
On thy sweet brow is sorrow plough'd by shame,
And annals graved in characters of flame.
995
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iv., St. 4.

Italy, my Italy!
Queen Mary's saying serves for me
  (When fortune's malice
  Lost her Calais):
"Open my heart, and you will see
Graved inside of it 'Italy.'"
996
ROBERT BROWNING: _De Gustibus,_ ii.


=Ivy.=

Oh, a dainty plant is the ivy green,
   That creepeth o'er ruins old!
Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,
   In his cell so lone and cold.
Creeping where no life is seen,
A rare old plant is the ivy green.
997
DICKENS: _Pickwick Papers,_ Ch. 6.

SPENSER: _Faerie Queene,_ Bk. vii., Canto vii., St. 42.

Its dread penalty--jealousy.

Was understood, the injur'd lover's hell.

A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it.

Of all the griefs that harass the distrest,
Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest.

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.

And over it softly her warm ear lays.

Guiltier than him they try.

Do not your juries give their verdict
As if they felt the cause, not heard it?

Run all on one side as they're packt.
1014
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. ii., Canto ii., Line 365.


=Justice.=

          And then, the justice;

With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Fall of wise saws and modern instances,
And so he plays his part.
1015
SHAKS.: _As You Like It,_ Act ii., Sc. 7.

Grow angry with your patience: 't is their care,
And must be yours, that guilty men escape not:

His little, nameless, unremembered acts
Of kindness and of love.

Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold.

For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.

Thy very soul is wedded unto mine.

Back to her mouth which answers there for all.

1036
COWPER: _Verses supposed to be written by Alexander Selkirk._

      Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
Her temp'rance over appetite, to know
In measure what the mind may well contain;
Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns
Wisdom to folly.
1037
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. vii., Line 126.

All our knowledge is, ourselves to know.
1038

_I know_--is all the mourner saith,
Knowledge by suffering entereth;
And Life is perfected by Death!
1039
MRS. BROWNING: _Vision of Poets,_ St. 330.

Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.

That springs from labor.
1045

That food and bliss should not be found unsought;

          Fit language there is none
For the heart's deepest things.
1054
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL: _Legend of Brittany,_ Pt. i., St. 28.

Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
  One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
  Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.
1055
LONGFELLOW: _Flowers._


=Lark.=

The herald of the morn; ... whose notes do beat
The vaulty heavens, so high above our heads, ...
Some say the lark makes sweet division.
1056
SHAKS.: _Rom. and Jul.,_ Act iii., Sc. 5.

  O'er thrones and globes elate,
Sits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.

1067

"The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of learning, late deceas'd in beggary,"--

              Learning unrefin'd,
That oft enlightens to corrupt the mind.

Some for renown, on scraps of learning dote,
And think they grow immortal as they quote.
1070

=Lending.=

Loan oft loses both itself and friend.
1071
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 3.

If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not

A breed of barren metal of his friend?)
But lend it rather to thine enemy;
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalties.
1072
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act i., Sc. 3.


=Letters.=

My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!
And yet they seem alive, and quivering
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
And let them drop down on my knee to-night.
1073
MRS. BROWNING: _Sonnets fr. Portuguese,_ Sonnet xxviii.

Kind messages, that pass from land to land;
Kind letters, that betray the heart's deep history,
In which we feel the pressure of a hand,--
One touch of fire,--and all the rest is mystery!
1074
LONGFELLOW: _Dedication to Seaside and Fireside,_ St. 5.

You have the letters Cadmus gave,--
Think ye he meant them for a slave?.
1075
BYRON: _Don Juan,_ Canto iii., St. 86. 10.

          I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please.
1076
SHAKS.: _As You Like It,_ Act ii., Sc. 7.

          In liberty's defence, my noble task,
Of which all Europe rings from side to side;
This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask,
Content, though blind--had I no better guide.
1077
MILTON: Sonnet xxii., _To Cyriack Skinner._

          When liberty is gone,
Life grows insipid and has lost its relish.
1078

          Liberty, like day,
Breaks on the soul, and by a flash from Heaven
Fires all the faculties with glorious joy.

You told a lie; an odious, damned lie:
Upon my soul, a lie; a wicked lie.
1082
SHAKS.: _Othello,_ Act v., Sc. 2.

Dare to be true. Nothing can need a lie;
A fault which needs it most, grows two thereby.
1083
HERBERT: _Temple, Church Porch,_ St. 13.


=Life.=

Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
1084
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act v., Sc. 5.

Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest,
Live well; how long or short, permit to Heav'n.
1085
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. xi., Line 553.

                Must we count
Life a curse and not a blessing, summed-up in its whole amount,
Help and hindrance, joy and sorrow?
1086
ROBERT BROWNING: _La Saisiaz,_ Line 206.

Between two worlds, life hovers like a star
'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.
1087
BYRON: _Don Juan,_ Canto xv., St. 99.

Our life is scarce the twinkle of a star
In God's eternal day.
1088
BAYARD TAYLOR: _Autumnal Vespers._

Life is the gift of God, and is divine.
1089
LONGFELLOW: _T. of a Wayside Inn,_ Emma and Eginhard.

What is life? A thawing iceboard
  On a sea with sunny shore:
Gay we sail; it melts beneath us;
  We are sunk and seen no more.
1090
CARLYLE: _Cui Bono._

          Life's a vast sea
That does its mighty errand without fail,
Panting in unchanged strength though waves are changing.
1091
GEORGE ELIOT: _Spanish Gypsy,_ Bk. iii.

Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold:
Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold,
Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,
Can bribe the poor possession of a day.
1092
POPE: _Iliad,_ Bk. ix., Line 524.

So careful of the type she seems,
So careless of the single life.
1093
TENNYSON: _In Memoriam,_ lv., St. 2.


=Light.=

Hail, holy Light! offspring of Heaven first-born!
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam,
May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,
And never but in unapproachèd light
Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate!
1094
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iii., Line 1.

But yet the light that led astray
    Was light from heaven.
1095
BURNS: _The Vision._

The light that never was, on sea or land;
The consecration, and the Poet's dream.
1096
WORDSWORTH: _Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm,_ St. 4.

Light, light, and light! to break and melt in sunder
  All clouds and chains that in one bondage bind
Eyes, hands, and spirits, forged by fear and wonder
  And sleek fierce fraud with hidden knife behind.
1097

    In twisted braids of lilies knitting
The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair.
1100
MILTON: _Comus,_ Line 859.


=Lincoln, Abraham.=

This man, whose homely face you look upon,
Was one of Nature's masterful, great men;
Born with strong arms, that unfought battles won
Direct of speech, and cunning with the pen.
Chosen for large designs, he had the art
Of winning with his humor, and he went
Straight to his mark, which was the human heart;
Wise, too, for what he could not break he bent.
Upon his back a more than Atlas-load,--
The burden of the Commonwealth,--was laid;
He stooped, and rose up to it, though the road
Shot suddenly downwards, not a whit dismayed.
Hold, warriors, councillors, kings! All now give place
To this dear benefactor of the Race.
1101
R.H. STODDARD: _Abraham Lincoln._

To be o'erpowered.

Such is the power of that sweet passion,
That it all sordid baseness doth expel,
And the refined mind doth newly fashion
Unto a fairer form, which now doth dwell
In his high thought, that would itself excel;
Which he, beholding still with constant sight,
Admires the mirror of so heavenly light.
1120
SPENSER: _Hymn in Honor of Love._

Instruct me now what love will do;
'T will make a tongueless man to woo.
Inform me next what love will do;

Teach me besides what love will do;
'T will quickly mar and make ye too.
Tell me, now last, what love will do;
'T will hurt and heal a heart pierc'd through.

1127
OWEN MEREDITH: _Lucile,_ Pt. ii., Canto i., St. 17.

'T is woman's whole existence.
1133
BYRON: _Don Juan,_ Canto i., St. 194.

In peace, Love tunes the shepherd's reed;
In war, he mounts the warrior's steed;
In halls, in gay attire is seen;
In hamlets, dances on the green;
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
And men below, and saints above;
For love is heaven and heaven is love.
1134
SCOTT: _Lay of the Last Minstrel,_ Canto iii., St. 2.

True love is at home on a carpet,
And mightily likes his ease,--
And true love has an eye for a dinner,
And starves beneath shady trees.
His wing is the fan of a lady,
His foot's an invisible thing,
And his arrow is tipp'd with a jewel,
And shot from a silver string.
1135
WILLIS: _Love in a Cottage._

What is love? 't is nature's treasure,

'T is a bliss which never cloys.
1136
THOMAS CHATTERTON: _The Revenge,_ Act i., Sc. 2.

Cool to a glorious evening, and expire.

One small grave is all he gets.

Unclose thy blue voluptuous eye,
And wave thy shadowy locks of gold.
1168
ERASMUS DARWIN: _L. of the Plants,_ Canto ii., Line 307.

Comes dancing from the east, and leads with her
The flowery May, who, from her green lap, throws
The yellow cowslip, and the pale primrose.

It gives me wonder, great as my content,
To see you here before me.
1170
SHAKS.: _Othello,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

Each hour until we meet is as a bird

Is every note he sings, in Love's own tongue.

=Men.=

Men are but children of a larger growth.
1179
DRYDEN: _All for Love,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.


=Mercy.=

The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven

'T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown.

Friendliest to sleep and silence.

Batter'd and black, as from a thousand battles,
Hangs silent on the purple walls of heaven.

Of mighty monarchs.
1206
THOMSON: _Seasons, Summer,_ Line 1285.


=Money.=

            This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions; bless the accurs'd;
Make the hoar leprosy ador'd; place thieves,
And give them title, knee, and approbation,
With senators on the bench.

1214
SCOTT: _Lady of the Lake,_ Canto v., St. 30.


=Moon.=

              Now glow'd the firmament
With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led
The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,
Rising in clouded majesty, at length,
Apparent queen, unveil'd her peerless light,
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
1215
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iv., Line 604.

From the slow opening curtains of the clouds;
Walking in beauty to her midnight throne!

The holiest thing alive.
1227
COLERIDGE: _The Three Graves._


=Mountains.=

I know a mount, the gracious Sun perceives
First when he visits, last, too, when he leaves
The world; and, vainly favored, it repays
The day-long glory of his steadfast gaze
By no change of its large calm front of snow.
1228
ROBERT BROWNING: _Rudel To The Lady of Tripoli._

                      And to me
High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
Of human cities torture.
1229
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iii., St. 72.


=Mounting.=

I mount and mount toward the sky,
The eagle's heart is mine,
I ride to put the clouds a-by
Where silver lakelets shine.
The roaring streams wax white with snow,
The eagle's nest draws near,
The blue sky widens, hid peaks glow,
The air is frosty clear.
And so from cliff to cliff I rise,
The eagle's heart is mine;
Above me ever broadning skies,
Below the rivers shine.
1230
HAMLIN GARLAND: _Mounting._


=Mourning.=

              We must all die!
All leave ourselves, it matters not where, when,
Nor how, so we die well: and can that man that does so
Need lamentation for him?
1231

DRYDEN: _Cock and Fox,_ Line 285.


=Music.=

The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,

Let no such man be trusted.
1235

            Music's golden tongue
Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor.
1236
KEATS: _Eve of St. Agnes,_ St. 3.

Music has charms to soothe the savage breast,
To soften rocks, or bend the knotted oak;
I've read that things inanimate have mov'd,
And, as with living souls, have been inform'd,
By magic numbers and persuasive sound.
1237
CONGREVE: _Mourning Bride,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

Music the fiercest grief can charm,
And fate's severest rage disarm.
Music can soften pain to ease,
And make despair and madness please;
Our joys below it can improve,
And antedate the bliss above.
1238
POPE: _Ode on St. Cecilia's Day,_ St. 7.

When Music, heavenly maid, was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Throng'd around her magic cell,
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possest beyond the Muse's painting.
1239
COLLINS: _The Passions,_ Line 1.

The soul of music slumbers in the shell,
Till wak'd and kindled by the master's spell,
And feeling hearts--touch them but rightly--pour
A thousand melodies unheard before.
1240
ROGERS: _Human Life,_ Line 362.

A few can touch the magic string,
  And noisy Fame is proud to win them;
Alas for those that never sing,
  But die with all their music in them!

=Name.=

What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet.
1242
SHAKS.: _Rom. and Jul.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Who hath not owned, with rapture-smitten frame,
The power of grace, the magic of a name?

CAMPBELL: _Pl. of Hope,_ Pt. ii., Line 5.


=Nature.=

Nature ever yields reward
To him who seeks, and loves her best.
1244
BARRY CORNWALL: _Above and Below._

      O Nature, how fair is thy face,
And how light is thy heart, and how friendless thy grace!
1245
OWEN MEREDITH: _Lucile,_ Pt. i., Canto v., St. 28.

    To him who in the love of Nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.
1246
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT: _Thanatopsis._


=News--Newspapers.=

        The first bringer of unwelcome news
Hath but a losing office; and his tongue
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
Remember'd knolling a departing friend.

Evil news rides post, while good news baits.
1248
MILTON: _Samson Agonistes,_ Line 1538.

Harangues and hailstones, brawls and broken necks.
1249
SPRAGUE: _Curiosity._


=Newton.=

Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night:
God said, "Let Newton be!" and all was light.
1250
POPE: _Epitaph intended for Sir Isaac Newton._

Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!
Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,
That he himself felt only "like a youth
Picking up shells by the great ocean--Truth."

Of terror and of beauty; ... God hath set
His rainbow on thy forehead; and the cloud
Mantles around thy feet.

=Night.=

Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes.
1254
SHAKS.: _Mid. N. Dream,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.

              Now began
Night with her sullen wing to double-shade
The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couch'd,
And now wild beasts came forth, the woods to roam.
1255
MILTON: _Par. Regained,_ Bk. i., Line 409.

      Awful Night!
Ancestral mystery of mysteries.
1256
GEORGE ELIOT: _Spanish Gypsy,_ Bk. iv.

Night, night it is, night upon the palms.
Night, night it is, the land wind has blown.
Starry, starry night, over deep and height;
Love, love in the valley, love all alone.
1257

Night is the time to weep,
  To wet with unseen tears
Those graves of memory where sleep
  The joys of other years.
1258
JAMES MONTGOMERY: _The Issues of Life and Death._


=Nightingale.=

The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise, and true perfection!
1259
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act v., Sc. 1.

O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray
Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,
Thou with fresh hope the lover's heart dost fill.
1260

At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where.
1263
POPE: _Essay on Man,_ Epis. ii., Line 222.


=November.=

Next was November; he full gross and fat
As fed with lard, and that right well might seem;
For he had been a-fatting hogs of late,
That yet his brows with sweat did reek and steam.
1264
SPENSER: _Faerie Queene,_ Bk. vii., Canto vii., St. 40.

In rattling showers dark November's rain,
From every stormy cloud, descends amain.

A song to the oak, the brave old oak,
Who hath ruled in the greenwood long!
1268
HENRY F. CHORLEY: _The Brave Old Oak._


=Oars.=

          The oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes.
1269
SHAKS.: _Ant. and Cleo.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.


=Oaths.=

'T is not the many oaths that make the truth;
But the plain single vow, that is vow'd true.
1270
SHAKS.: _All 's Well,_ Act iv., Sc. 2.

Oaths were not purpos'd, more than law,
To keep the good and just in awe,

Like moral cattle, in a pinfold.

That doth not smack of observation.
1274
SHAKS.: _King John,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Ocean.=

Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,
He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffin'd, and unknown.
1275
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iv., St. 179.

        One height
Showed him the ocean, stretched in liquid light,
And he could hear its multitudinous roar,
Its plunge and hiss upon the pebbled shore.
1276
GEORGE ELIOT: _Legend of Jubal,_ Line 506.

The sweet calm sunshine of October, now
Warms the low spot; upon its grassy mould
The purple oak-leaf falls; the birchen bough
Drops its bright spoil like arrow-heads of gold.

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT: _October, 1866._

October's foliage yellows with his cold.

And love the offender, yet detest the offence.
1280
POPE: _Eloisa to A.,_ Line 192.


=Old Age.=

Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood;
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility:
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly.
1281

When he is forsaken,
Withered and shaken,
What can an old man do but die?

1284
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. iii., Canto iii., Line 547.

O Opportunity! thy guilt is great:
'T is thou that execut'st the traitor's treason;
Thou sett'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;
Whoever plots the sin, thou point'st the season;

Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece,
To Macedon, and Artaxerxes' throne.
1287
MILTON: _Par. Regained,_ Bk. iv., Line 267.


=Order.=

Order is heav'n's first law; and this confest,
Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,
More rich, more wise; but who infers from hence
That such are happier, shocks all common sense.
1288
POPE: _Essay on Man,_ Epis. iv., Line 49.

Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea.

DEFOE: _True-Born Englishman,_ Pt. i., Line 1.

Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
For truth hath better deeds, than words, to grace it.
1301

            They who go
Feel not the pain of parting; it is they

1305
SIR WALTER RALEIGH: _Silent Lover._

Over the trackless past, somewhere,
Lie the lost days of our tropic youth,
Only regained by faith and prayer,
Only recalled by prayer and plaint:
Each lost day has its patron saint.

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!

Of saints, the trial of their fortitude,
Making them each his own deliverer,

        Patience is a plant
That grows not in all gardens.

From every mountain side
    Let freedom ring.

SAMUEL F. SMITH: _National Hymn._

        Sail on, O Ship of State!
Sail on, O Union, strong and great!
Humanity with all its fears,
With all the hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!

=Peace.=

A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
For then both parties nobly are subdued,
And neither party loser.
1317
SHAKS.: _2 Henry IV.,_ Act iv., Sc. 2.

I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to see my shadow in the sun.
1318

This dull product of a scoffer's pen.
1324
WORDSWORTH: _Excursion,_ Bk. ii.

1327
SHAKS.: _Rom. and Jul.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel.
1333
SHAKS.: _King Lear,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

Pleasure must succeed to pleasure, else past pleasure turns to pain.

True as the needle to the pole,
Or as the dial to the sun.
1354
BARTON BOOTH: _Song._

Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain,--

And paid the salutations of the crowd.
1358
DRYDEN: _Palamon and Arcite,_ Bk. iii., Line 689.


=Possession.=

    What we have we prize not to the worth,
Whiles we enjoy it; but being lacked and lost,
Why then we rack the value, then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours.
1359
SHAKS.: _Much Ado,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

Possession means to sit astride of the world,
Instead of having it astride of you.

        Most wretched men
Are cradled into poetry by wrong.

Sufficeth them, the simple plan,
That they should take who have the power,
And they should keep who can.
1366
WORDSWORTH: _Rob Roy's Grave._


=Prairie.=

Far in the East like low-hung clouds
  The waving woodlands lie;
Far in the West the glowing plain

No accent wounds the reverent air,--
  No footprint dints the sod,--
Low in the light the prairie lies
  Rapt in a dream of God.
1367

Let never day nor night unhallowed pass,
But still remember what the Lord hath done.
1370
SHAKS.: _2 Henry VI.,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

            If by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of him who all things can, I would not cease
To weary him with my assiduous cries;
But prayer against his absolute decree
No more avails than breath against the wind
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
1371
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. xi., Line 307.

He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small;
For the dear God who loveth us,
He made and loveth all.

God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers,
And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face,
A gauntlet with a gift in 't.

Than this world dreams of.

Till it gives its blessing.

Here shall the Press the People's right maintain,
Unaw'd by influence and unbrib'd by gain.
1377

To show itself, but pride; for supple knees
Feed arrogance, and are the proud man's fees.

And the Devil did grin, for his darling sin
    Is pride that apes humility.

Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.

Some said, "It might do good"; others said, "No."

Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage;
Minds innocent and quiet, take
That for an hermitage.
1384
LOVELACE: _To Althea, from Prison,_ iv.


=Procrastination.=

Procrastination is the thief of time:
Year after year it steals, till all are fled,
And to the mercies of a moment leaves
The vast concerns of an eternal scene.
1385
YOUNG: _Night Thoughts,_ Night i., Line 393.


=Prodigies.=

          When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say

Unto the climate that they point upon.
1386

=Proof.=

            Give me the ocular proof;

That the probation bear no hinge, nor loop,
To hang a doubt on.

1398
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act v., Sc. 2.

I may assert Eternal Providence
And justify the ways of God to men.

Who finds not Providence all good and wise,

In every change both mine and yours.

1403
ROBERT LOWTH: _Choice of Hercules,_ i.


=Prudery.=

Yon ancient prude, whose wither'd features show
She might be young some forty years ago,
Her elbows pinion'd close upon her hips,
Her head erect, her fan upon her lips,
Her eyebrows arch'd, her eyes both gone astray
To watch yon amorous couple in their play,
With bony and unkerchief'd neck defies
The rude inclemency of wintry skies,
And sails, with lappet-head and mincing airs,
Duly at chink of bell to morning prayers.
1404

Was beat with fist instead of a stick.

Rich scarf to my proud earth.

In the dull catalogue of common things.
Philosophy will clip an angel's wings.

Superior worth your rank requires:
For that, mankind reveres your sires;
If you degenerate from your race,
Their merits heighten your disgrace.

The rank is but the guinea stamp,
The man's the gowd for a' that.

1438
HOOD: _The Bridge of Sighs._


=Reading.=

              Many books,
Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads
Incessantly, and to his reading brings not
A spirit and judgment equal or superior,
Uncertain and unsettled still remains--
Deep versed in books, and shallow in himself.
1439
MILTON: _Par. Regained,_ Bk. iv., Line 321.

When the last reader reads no more.
1440

                Their weapons only
Seem'd on our side, but, for their spirits and souls,
This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
As fish are in a pond.

Rebellion now began, for lack
Of zeal and plunder, to grow slack.
1449

Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
And, at her heels, a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures, and foes to life?
1456
SHAKS.: _Com. of Errors,_ Act v., Sc. 1.

Of recreation there is none
So free as Fishing is alone;
All other pastimes do no less
Than mind and body both possess:
    My hand alone my work can do,
    So I can fish and study too.

What need we any spur but our own cause
To prick us to redress.

Still to be plotting some new Reformation.

Oh death in life, the days that are no more!
1462
TENNYSON: _The Princess,_ Pt. iv., Line 36.


=Religion.=

                          In Religion
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it, and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament.
1463
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.

                Religion is a spring,
That from some secret, golden mine
Derives her birth, and thence doth bring
Cordials in every drop, and wine.
1464
HENRY VAUGHAN: _Religion._

Religion crowns the statesman and the man,
Sole source of public and of private peace.
1465
YOUNG: _Public Situation of the Kingdom,_ Line 500.

Pity Religion has so seldom found
A skilful guide into poetic ground!
1466
COWPER: _Table Talk,_ Line 17.

Religion stands on tiptoe in our land,
Ready to pass to the American strand.
1467
HERBERT: _The Church Militant._


=Remedies.=

Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to Heaven; the fated sky
Gives us free scope; only, doth backward pull
Our slow designs, when we ourselves are dull.
1468
SHAKS.: _All 's Well,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Remembrance.=

The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,

        Praising what is lost,
Makes the remembrance dear.

I've been so long remembered, I'm forgot.
1471
YOUNG: _Night Thoughts,_ Night iv., Line 57.

I remember, I remember,
The fir trees dark and high:
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky;
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm farther off from heaven
Than when I was a boy.
1472
HOOD: _I Remember, I Remember._


=Remorse.=

Remorse is as the heart in which it grows,
If that be gentle, it drops balmy dews
Of true repentance; but if proud and gloomy,
It is the poison tree that, pierced to the inmost,
Weeps only tears of poison.
1473
COLERIDGE: _Remorse,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Renown.=

Short is my date, but deathless my renown.
1474
POPE: _Iliad,_ Bk. ix., Line 535.


=Repartee.=

A man renown'd for repartee

With friendship's finest feeling,

By way of balm for healing.
1475
COWPER: _Friendship,_ Line 16.


=Repentance.=

Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth; for these are pleased;

Illusion is brief, but Repentance is long!
1477
SCHILLER: _Lay of the Bell,_ St. 4.

    Repentance is the weight
Of indigested meals eat yesterday.
1478
GEORGE ELIOT: _Spanish Gypsy,_ Bk. ii.

Amid the roses fierce Repentance rears
Her snaky crest.
1479
THOMSON: _Seasons, Spring,_ Line 996.


=Repose.=

The best of men have ever loved repose:
They hate to mingle in the filthy fray,
Where the soul sours, and gradual rancor grows,
Imbitter'd more from peevish day to day.
1480
THOMSON: _Castle of Indolence,_ Canto i., St. 17.

Her suffering ended with the day,
  Yet lived she at its close,
And breathed the long, long night away,
  In statue-like repose.
1481
JAMES ALDRICH: _A Death-Bed._


=Reproof.=

Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;
Those best can bear reproof who merit praise.

Reproof on her lips, but a smile in her eye.
1483
LOVER: _Rory O'More._

The purest treasure mortal times afford,

At every word a reputation dies.
1485

To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
1486

While Resignation gently slopes away,
And all his prospects brightening to the last,
His heaven commences ere the world be past.
1487
GOLDSMITH: _Des. Village,_ Line 110.


=Resolution.=

                The native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.
1488
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.


=Respect.=

You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it, that do buy it with much care.
1489
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Rest.=

Who with a body filled and vacant mind
Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread.

For too much rest itself becomes a pain.
1492

And life's latest sands are its sands of gold.

=Retirement.=

Retiring from the popular noise, I seek
This unfrequented place to find some ease.
1494
MILTON: _Samson Agonistes,_ Line 16.

O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,
Retreats from care that never must be mine,
How happy he who crowns, in shades like these,
A youth of labor, with an age of ease;
Who quits a world where strong temptations try,
And, since 't is hard to combat, learns to fly.
1495
GOLDSMITH: _Des. Village,_ Line 97.


=Retreat.=

In all the trade of war, no feat
Is nobler than a brave retreat;
For those that run away, and fly,
Take place at least of the enemy.
1496
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. i., Canto iii., Line 607.


=Revelry.=

Midnight shout and revelry,
Tipsy dance and jollity.
1497

There was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gather'd then
Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.
1498
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iii., St. 21.


=Revenge.=

And Cæsar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Até by his side, come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,
Cry "Havock," and let slip the dogs of war.
1499
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

            Revenge, at first though sweet,
Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils.
1500

Vengeance to God alone belongs;

My blood is liquid flame.
1501

Whilst we show reverence to yond peeping moon.
1502
MIDDLETON: _The Witch,_ Act v., Sc. 2.


=Revolution.=

There is great talk of revolution,
And a great chance of despotism,
German soldiers, camps, confusion,
Tumults, lotteries, rage, delusion,
Gin, suicide, and Methodism.
1503
SHELLEY: _Peter Bell the Third, Hell,_ St. 6.


=Rhetoric.=

For Rhetoric, he could not ope
His mouth, but out there flew a trope.

Enjoy your dear wit and gay rhetoric,
That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence.
1505

=Rhine.=

The castled crag of Drachenfels
Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine.
1506

The river Rhine, it is well known,
Doth wash your city of Cologne;
But tell me, nymphs! what power divine
Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?
1507
COLERIDGE: _Cologne._


=Rhyme.=

Still may syllables jar with time,
Still may reason war with rhyme.
1508
BEN JONSON: _Fit of Rhyme against Rhyme._

                      He knew
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.
1509
MILTON: _Lycidas,_ Line 10.

For rhyme the rudder is of verses,
With which, like ships, they steer their courses.
1510
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. i., Canto i., Line 463.


=Riches.=

Infinite riches in a little room.
1511
MARLOWE: _The Jew of Malta,_ Act i.

Extol not riches then, the toil of fools,
The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt
To slacken virtue, and abate her edge,
Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.
1512
MILTON: _Par. Regained,_ Bk ii., Line 453.


=Ridicule.=

Ridicule is a weak weapon, when levelled at a strong mind;
But common men are cowards, and dread an empty laugh.
1513
TUPPER: _Proverbial Phil., Of Ridicule._

Sacred to ridicule his whole life long,
And the sad burden of some merry song.
1514
POPE: Satire i., Bk. ii., Line 76.


=Right.=

But 't was a maxim he had often tried,
That right was right, and there he would abide.
1515
CRABBE: _Tales:_ Tale xv., _The Squire and the Priest._

For right is right, since God is God,
  And right the day must win;
To doubt would be disloyalty,
  To falter would be sin.

Changeless to the changeless sea.

The river glideth at his own sweet will.
1520
WORDSWORTH: _Earth has not anything to show more fair._


=Robbery.=

    I'll example you with thievery:
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement: each thing's a thief.
1521
SHAKS.: _Timon of A.,_ Act iv., Sc. 3.


=Rock.=

Better to sink beneath the shock
Than moulder piecemeal on the rock.

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.

To check the erring, and reprove.

    Lady of the Mere,
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.

Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;

The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem,
For that sweet odor which doth in it live.

You love the roses--so do I. I wish
The sky would rain down roses, as they rain
From off the shaken bush.

As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.
1535

Yet all my loveliness is born
Upon a thorn.

Strew on her roses, roses,
  And never a spray of yew!
In quiet she reposes;
  Ah, would that I did too.
1537
MATTHEW ARNOLD: _Requiescat._


=Rousseau.=

The self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,
The apostle of affliction--he, who threw
Enchantment over passion, and from woe
Wrung overwhelming eloquence.
1538
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iii., St. 77.


=Royalty.=

O wretched state of Kings! O doleful fate!
Greatness misnamed, in misery only great!
Could men but know the endless woe it brings,
The wise would die before they would be Kings.
Think what a King must do!
1539
R.H. STODDARD: _The King's Bell._


=Ruin.=

Where my high steeples whilom used to stand,
On which the lordly falcon wont to tower,
There now is but an heap of lime and sand,
For the screech-owl to build her baleful bower.

His blood-dyed waters murmuring far below.

And one prodigious ruin swallow all.
1542
POPE: _Iliad,_ Bk. iv., Line 196.


=Ruling Passions.=

In men, we various Ruling Passions find;
In women, two almost divide the kind;
Those, only fix'd, they first or last obey,
The love of pleasure and the love of sway.
1543
POPE: _Moral Essays,_ Epis. ii., Line 207.


=Rumor.=

              Rumor is a pipe
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures;
And of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
The still-discordant wavering multitude,
Can play upon it.
1544
SHAKS.: _Henry IV.,_ Pt. ii., Induction.


=Rural Life.=

          Of men
The happiest he, who far from public rage,
Deep in the vale, with a choice few retired,
Drinks the pure pleasures of the rural life.

THOMSON: _Seasons, Autumn,_ Line 1132.




==S.==

              The Sabbath bell,
That over wood, and wild, and mountain dell
Wanders so far, chasing all thoughts unholy
With sounds most musical, most melancholy.

    Sing the dangers of the sea.

=Sails.=

Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them.
1555
SHAKS.: _Ant. and Cleo.,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

He that has sail'd upon the dark blue sea
Has view'd at times, I ween, a full fair sight;
When the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be,
The white sails set, the gallant frigate tight;
Masts, spires, and strand retiring to the right,
The glorious main expanding o'er the bow,
The convoy spread like wild swans in their flight,
The dullest sailer wearing bravely now,
So gayly curl the waves before each dashing prow.
1556
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto ii., St. 17.


=Saints.=

And now the saints began their reign,
For which they'd yearn'd so long in vain,
And felt such bowel-hankerings,
To see an empire, all of kings.
1557
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. iii., Canto ii., Line 237.

For virtue's self may too much zeal be had;
The worst of madmen is a saint run mad.

There is a land of pure delight,
    Where saints immortal reign.

=Salt.=

Alas! you know the cause too well;
The salt is spilt, to me it fell.
1562
GAY: _Fables,_ Pt. i., Fable 37.

Why dost thou shun the salt? that sacred pledge,
Which once partaken blunts the sabre's edge,
Makes even contending tribes in peace unite,
And hated hosts seem brethren to the sight.

Who ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar.
1564
POPE: _Odyssey,_ Bk. xi., Line 153.


=Salvation.=

                  About some act
That has no relish of salvation in 't.
1565
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 3.

                  Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation.
1566
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

Dropt from the ruined sides of kings.

And thence in heaven call'd Satan,--with bold words

The weakest saint upon his knees.

More than a little is by much too much.

With pleasure drugg'd he almost long'd for woe,
And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.
1573
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto i., St. 6.


=Satire.=

Satire's my weapon, but I'm too discreet
To run a-muck, and tilt at all I meet;
I only wear it in a land of Hectors,
Thieves, supercargoes, sharpers, and directors.
1574
POPE: Satire i., Line 69.

Prepare for rhyme--I'll publish, right or wrong;

A slight attack, yet neither fears nor grieves.

Ere the base laws of servitude began,
When wild in woods the noble savage ran.

And after scandal them.
1579
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act i., Sc. 2.

The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
And all lips were applied unto all ears!
The elder ladies' wrinkles curled much crisper
As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
On one another, and each lovely lisper
Smiled as she talked the matter o'er: but tears
Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
Of all the standing army that stood by.
1580
BYRON: _Don Juan,_ Canto ix., St. 78

For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd eyes,
Gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise.
1583
ADDISON: _A Letter from Italy._


=Scepticism.=

Oh! lives there, heaven! beneath thy dread expanse,
One hopeless, dark idolater of chance,
Content to feed with pleasures unrefin'd,
The lukewarm passions of a lowly mind;
Who mouldering earthward, 'reft of every trust,
In joyless union wedded to the dust,
Could all his parting energy dismiss,
And call this barren world sufficient bliss?
1584
CAMPBELL: _Pl. of Hope,_ Pt. ii., Line 295.

Whatever sceptic could inquire for,
For every why he had a wherefore.
1585
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. i., Canto i., Line 131.

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings.
1586
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.


=Scholar.=

He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;

His locked, lettered, braw brass collar
Showed him the gentleman and scholar.

And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school.
1590
SHAKS.: _As You Like It,_ Act ii., Sc. 7.

Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,
The village master taught his little school;
A man severe he was, and stern to view,--
I knew him well, and every truant knew;
Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace
The day's disasters in his morning face.
1591
GOLDSMITH: _Des. Village,_ Line 193.


=Science.=

Trace science then, with modesty thy guide;
First strip off all her equipage of pride;
Deduct what is but vanity, or dress,
Or learning's luxury, or idleness;
Or tricks to show the stretch of human brain,
Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain;
Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent parts
Of all our vices have created arts;
Then see how little the remaining sum
Which serv'd the past, and must the times to come.
1592
POPE: _Essay on Man,_ Epis. ii., Line 43.

O star-eyed Science! hast thou wander'd there,
To waft us home the message of despair?

To point his slow and moving finger at.

So let him stand, through ages yet unborn,
Fix'd statue on the pedestal of scorn!
1596
BYRON: _Curse of Minerva,_ Line 207.

On all sides, from innumerable tongues,
A dismal universal hiss, the sound
Of public scorn.

=Scotland.=

Stands Scotland where it did?
1598

Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content.

    We left fair Scotland's strand.

                A sculptor wields
The chisel, and the stricken marble grows
To beauty.

=Sea.=

The rude sea grew civil at her song,
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
To hear the sea-maid's music.
1605
SHAKS.: _Mid. N. Dream,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

The sea! the sea! the open sea!
The blue, the fresh, the ever free!
Without a mark, without a bound,
It runneth the earth's wide region round;
It plays with the clouds; it mocks the skies;
Or like a cradled creature lies.
1606
BARRY CORNWALL: _The Sea._

Broad based upon her people's will,
And compassed by the inviolate sea.

With hollow blasts of wind,
A damsel lay deploring,
All on a rock reclin'd.

=Sea-weed.=

A weary weed, toss'd to and fro,
Drearily drench'd in the ocean brine,
Soaring high and sinking low,
Lashed along without will of mine,--
Sport of the spoom of the surging sea,
Flung on the foam afar and anear,
Mark my manifold mystery,--
Growth and grace in their place appear.
1609
CORNELIUS G. FENNER: _Gulf-Weed._


=Seasons.=

Perceiv'st thou not the process of the year,
How the four seasons in four forms appear,
Resembling human life in ev'ry shape they wear?
_Spring_ first, like infancy, shoots out her head,
With milky juice requiring to be fed: ...
Proceeding onward whence the year began,
The _Summer_ grows adult, and ripens into man....
_Autumn_ succeeds, a sober, tepid age,
Not froze with fear, nor boiling into rage; ...
Last, _Winter_ creeps along with tardy pace,
Sour is his front, and furrowed is his face.
1610
DRYDEN: _Of Pythagorean Phil. From, 15th Book Ovid's Metamorphoses,_
  Line 206.

With thee conversing I forget all time,
All seasons, and their change,--all please alike.
1611
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iv., Line 639.

            Thus with the year
Seasons return; but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom or summer's rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine.
1612
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iii., Line 40.

But looks through Nature up to Nature's God.

=Selfishness.=

Despite those titles, power and pelf,

Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.

No self-reproach.

The spirit of self-sacrifice.
1634

Beware from right to swerve.
1648
EMERSON: _Boston Hymn,_ St. 13.


=Sex.=

Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
1649

          Spirits when they please,
Can either sex assume, or both.
1650
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. i., Line 423.


=Sexton.=

See yonder maker of the dead man's bed,
The sexton, hoary-headed chronicle!
Of hard, unmeaning face, down which ne'er stole
A gentle tear; with mattock in his hand,
Digs thro' whole rows of kindred and acquaintance
By far his juniors! Scarce a skull's cast up
But well he knew its owner, and can tell
Some passage of his life.
1651
BLAIR: _The Grave,_ Line 452.

His death, which happened in his berth,
  At forty-odd befell:
They went and told the sexton, and
  The sexton tolled the bell.
1652
HOOD: _Faithless Sally Brown._


=Shadow.=

Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

Meroe, Nilotic isle.

Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,
Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.
1655
JOHN FLETCHER: _Upon an "Honest Man's Fortune."_


=Shaft.=

In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
The selfsame way, with more advised watch,
To find the other forth; and by adventuring both
I oft found both.
1656
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

That eagle's fate and mine are one,
  Which on the shaft that made him die
Espied a feather of his own,
  Wherewith he wont to soar so high.
1657
WALLER: _To a Lady Singing a Song of his Composing._


=Shakespeare.=

                  Soul of the age!
Th' applause! delight! the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee room;
Thou art a monument, without a tomb,
And art alive still, while thy book doth live,
And we have wits to read, and praise to give.
1658
BEN JONSON: _Underwoods, To the Mem. of Shakespeare._

There, Shakespeare, on whose forehead climb
The crowns o' the world. Oh, eyes sublime,
With tears and laughters for all time!
1659
MRS. BROWNING: _Vision of Poets,_ St. 101.

Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,
Warble his native wood-notes wild.
1660
MILTON: _L'Allegro,_ Line 129.

What needs my Shakespeare for his honor'd bones,--
The labor of an age in piled stones?
Or that his hallow'd relics should be hid
Under a star-y-pointing pyramid?
Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,
What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name?
1661
MILTON: _On Shakespeare._


=Shame.=

O, shame! where is thy blush?
1662
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

  But 'neath yon crimson tree
Lover to listening maid might breathe his flame,
Nor mark, within its roseate canopy,
  Her blush of maiden shame.
1663
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT: _Autumn Woods._


=Shape.=

Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble.
1664
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

                      The other shape,
If shape it might be call'd that shape had none
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb.
1665
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. ii., Line 681.


=Shell.=

                  I have seen
A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
Of inland ground, applying to his ear
The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell,
To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
Listened intensely.
1666
WORDSWORTH: _The Excursion,_ Bk. iv.


=Shelley.=

Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,
  And did he stop and speak to you,
And did you speak to him again?
  How strange it seems, and new!
1667
ROBERT BROWNING: _Memorabilia,_ i.


=Sheridan.=

Long shall we seek his likeness--long in vain,
And turn to all of him which may remain,
Sighing that nature form'd but one such man,
And broke the die--in moulding Sheridan.
1668
BYRON: _Monody on the Death of Sheridan._


=Shield.=

When Prussia hurried to the field,
And snatch'd the spear, but left the shield.
1669
SCOTT: _Marmion,_ Introduction to Canto iii.


=Ships.=

Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,
And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
1670
MARLOWE: _Faustus._

Like sister sails that drift at night
Together on the deep,
Seen only where they cross the light
That pathless waves must pathlike keep
From fisher's signal fire, or pharos steep.

RUSKIN: _The Broken Chain,_ Pt. v., St. 25.

She walks the waters like a thing of life,
And seems to dare the elements to strife.

As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.
1673
COLERIDGE: _The Ancient Mariner,_ Pt. ii.


=Shipwreck.=

                O, I have suffer'd
With those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,
Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart! poor souls! they perish'd.
1674
SHAKS.: _Tempest,_ Act i., Sc. 2.

Again she plunges! hark! a second shock
Bilges the splitting Vessel on the Rock--
Down on the vale of death, with dismal cries
The fated victims shuddering cast their eyes,
In wild despair; while yet another stroke,
With strong convulsion rends the solid oak:
Ah Heaven!--behold her crashing ribs divide!
She loosens, parts, and spreads in ruin o'er the Tide.
1675
FALCONER: _Shipwreck,_ Canto iii., Line 642.


=Shoes.=

I saw them go: one horse was blind,
The tails of both hung down behind,
  Their shoes were on their feet.
1676

Let firm, well-hammer'd soles protect thy feet,
Thro' freezing snows, and rain, and soaking sleet.
1677
GAY: _Trivia,_ Bk. i., Line 33.


=Shore.=

But the poor, unsightly, noisome things
Had left their beauty on the shore,
With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.
1678
EMERSON: _Each and All._

There is a rapture on the lonely shore;
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar.
1679
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iv., St. 178.

A strong nor'wester 's blowing, Bill!
  Hark! don't ye hear it roar now?
Lord help 'em, how I pities them
  Unhappy folks on shore now!
1680
WILLIAM PITT: _The Sailor's Consolation._


=Show.=

Live to be the show and gaze o' the time.
1681

With books and money plac'd for show
Like nest-eggs to make clients lay,
And for his false opinion pay.
1682
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. iii., Canto iii., Line 624.


=Shrine.=

What sought they thus afar?
  Bright jewels of the mine,
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
  They sought a faith's pure shrine.
1683
HEMANS: _Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._


=Sickness.=

          This sickness doth infect
The very life-blood of our enterprise.
1684

She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.

What Heaven hath done for this delicious land.
1688
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto i., St. 15.


=Signs.=

Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish:
A vapor, sometime, like a bear, or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
With trees upon 't, that nod unto the world,
And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.
1689
SHAKS.: _Ant. and Cleo.,_ Act iv., Sc. 12.


=Silence.=

Silence is the perfectest herald of joy:
I were but little happy, if I could say how much.
1690
SHAKS.: _Much Ado,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

Silence in love bewrays more woe
Than words, tho' ne'er so witty;
A beggar that is dumb, you know,
May challenge double pity.
1691
SIR WALTER RALEIGH: _Silent Lover,_ St. 6.

Silence more musical than any song.
1692
CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI: _Rest._

Silence accompany'd; for beast and bird,
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
Silence was pleas'd.
1693
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. iv., Line 598.

There was silence deep as death,
And the boldest held his breath
For a time.
1694
CAMPBELL: _Battle of the Baltic._

There is a silence where hath been no sound,
There is a silence where no sound may be,--
In the cold grave, under the deep, deep sea,
Or in the wide desert where no life is found.
1695
HOOD: _Sonnet, Silence._


=Silver.=

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops.
1696

Like will to like: each creature loves his kind,
Chaste words proceed still from a bashful mind.

HERRICK: _Aph. Like Loves His Like._


=Simplicity.=

And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
And captive good attending captive ill.
1698

Rich in saving common-sense,
And, as the greatest only are.
In his simplicity sublime.
1699

=Sin.=

Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousell'd, disappointed, unaneled.

One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
Murder's as near to lust, as flame to smoke.

SHAKS.: _Pericles,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

In lashing sin, of every stroke beware,
For sinners feel, and sinners you must spare.

But sad as angels for the good man's sin,
Weep to record, and blush to give it in.
1703
CAMPBELL: _Pl. of Hope,_ Pt. ii., Line 357.

I waive the quantum o' the sin,
  The hazard of concealing;
But, och! it hardens a' within,
  And petrifies the feeling!

BURNS: _Epistle to a Young Friend._

Compound for sins they are inclined to,
By damning those they have no mind to.
1705
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. i., Canto i., Line 215.


=Sincerity.=

I never tempted her with word too large,
But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
Bashful sincerity and comely love.
1706
SHAKS.: _Much Ado,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for 's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What his breast forges that his tongue must vent.
1707
SHAKS.: _Coriolanus,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.


=Singing.=

But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims.
1708
SHAKS.: _M. of Venice,_ Act v., Sc. 1.

Sing, seraph with the glory! heaven is high.
Sing, poet with the sorrow! earth is low.
The universe's inward voices cry
"Amen" to either song of joy and woe.
Sing, seraph, poet! sing on equally!
1709
MRS. BROWNING: _Sonnets, Seraph and Poet._

I send my heart up to thee, all my heart
In this my singing!
For the stars help me, and the sea bears part.
1710
ROBERT BROWNING: _In a Gondola._

I do but sing because I must,
    And pipe but as the linnets sing.

But I am truest speaker. You call'd me brother
When I was but your sister.
1714
SHAKS.: _Cymbeline,_ Act v., Sc. 5.


=Skill.=

How happy is he born or taught,
  That serveth not another's will;
Whose armor is his honest thought,
  And simple truth his utmost skill!
1715
WOTTON: _Character of a Happy Life._


=Skull.=

Look on its broken arch, its ruined wall,
Its chambers desolate, its portals foul;
Yes, this was once ambition's airy hall,
The dome of thought, the palace of the soul.
1716
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto ii., St. 6.


=Sky.=

Man is the nobler growth our realms supply,
And souls are ripened in our northern sky.
1717
MRS. BARBAULD: _The Invitation._

The sky is changed,--and such a change. O night
And storm and darkness! ye are wondrous strong,
Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
Of a dark eye in woman!
1718
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iii., St. 92.


=Slander.=

Slanderous reproaches, and foul infamies,
Leasings, backbitings, and vainglorious crakes,
Bad counsels, praises, and false flatteries;
All those against that fort did bend their batteries.
1719
SPENSER: _Faerie Queene,_ Bk. ii., Canto xi., St. 10.

          'T is slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword: whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath
Bides on the posting winds, and doth belie
All corners of the world,--kings, queens, and states,
Maids, matrons,--nay, the secrets of the grave
This viperous slander enters.
1720
SHAKS.: _Cymbeline,_ Act iii., Sc. 4.

'T was slander filled her mouth with lying words,--
Slander, the foulest whelp of sin.

Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
With favor never clasp'd: but bred a dog.
1722
SHAKS.: _Timon of A.,_ Act iv., Sc. 3.

He finds his fellow guilty of a skin
Not color'd like his own, and having pow'r
T' enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause
Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.
1723

            We are such stuff
As dreams are made on; and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.
1726
SHAKS.: _Tempest,_ Act iv., Sc. 1.

Sleep, that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast.
1727
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

Come, sleep, O sleep! the certain knot of peace,
The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe;

The impartial judge between the high and low.
1728
SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Astrophel and Stella,_ St. 39.

Tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep!

Where fortune smiles--the wretched he forsakes.

O magic sleep! O comfortable bird
That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
Till it is hush'd and smooth!
1730

      Sleep hath its own world,
A boundary between the things misnamed
Death and existence: Sleep hath its own world,
And a wide realm of wild reality.

BYRON: _Dream,_ Line 1.

Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
Morn of toil, nor night of waking.
1732
SCOTT: _Lady of the Lake,_ Canto i., St. 31.

Of all the thoughts of God that are
Borne inward into souls afar,
Along the Psalmist's music deep,
Now tell me if that any is,
For gift or grace, surpassing this--
"He giveth His beloved sleep"?

Grinn'd horrible a ghastly smile, to hear

Without the smile from partial beauty won,
Oh what were man?--a world without a sun.

And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.

Long after fearing to creep forth again.
1744
SHAKS.: _Venus and A.,_ Line 1033.

Remains in danger of her former tooth.

SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.


=Snow.=

Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
1746
SHAKS.: _Richard II.,_ Act i., Sc. 3

A cheer for the snow--the drifting snow;
Smoother and purer than Beauty's brow;
The creature of thought scarce likes to tread
On the delicate carpet so richly spread.
1747
ELIZA COOK: _Snow._

Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,
Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,
Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven.

Comes on, the herald of fair Flora's train.

   Prevent your ladyship from taking snuff.

Society became my glittering bride,
And airy hopes my children.
1753
WORDSWORTH: _Excursion,_ Bk. iii.

Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth.

        And but for these vile guns,
He would himself have been a soldier.
1755
SHAKS.: _1 Henry IV.,_ Act i., Sc. 3.

The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
Sat by his fire, and talk'd the night away;
Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,
Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.
1756

Than reign in this horrible place.

For lack of listeners are not said.

Self-taught I sing; by Heaven, and Heaven alone,
The genuine seeds of poesy are sown.
1766
POPE: _Odyssey,_ Bk. xxii., Line 382.

Scorn not the sonnet. Critic, you have frowned,
Mindless of its just honors; with this key

That may succeed as his inheritor.

To shape the outward to its own estate.

Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
Of some great ammiral were but a wand.

            Rude am I in my speech
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace.

Speech is but broken light upon the depth
Of the unspoken; even your loved words
Float in the larger meaning of your voice
As something dimmer.
1779
GEORGE ELIOT: _Spanish Gypsy,_ Bk. 1.


=Spenser.=

Nor shall my verse that elder bard forget,
The gentle Spenser, fancy's pleasing son;
Who, like a copious river, poured his song
O'er all the mazes of enchanted ground.
1780
THOMSON: _Seasons, Summer,_ Line 1574.

Besprent from shore to shore with steeple towers,
And spires whose "silent finger points to heaven."
1781

I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Why, so can I; or so can any man:
But will they come, when you do call for them?

Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.

WORDSWORTH: _Intimations of Immortality,_ St. 10.


=Sport.=

                      Thick around
Thunders the sport of those, who with the gun
And dog, impatient bounding at the shot,
Worse than the season desolate the fields.
1785
THOMSON: _Seasons, Winter,_ Line 788.


=Spring.=

In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.
1786
TENNYSON: _Locksley Hall,_ Line 19.

Come, gentle Spring, ethereal mildness, come;
And from the bosom of your dropping cloud,
While music wakes around, veiled in a shower
Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend.
1787
THOMSON: _Seasons, Spring,_ Line 1.

"Come, gentle Spring! ethereal mildness, come!"--
Oh! Thomson, void of rhyme as well as reason,
How could'st thou thus poor human nature hum?
There 's no such season.
1788
HOOD: _Spring._


=Stage.=

          All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players,
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
1789
SHAKS.: _As You Like It,_ Act ii., Sc. 7.


=Stars.=

Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere.

The stars of the night
Will lend thee their light,
Like tapers clear without number!
1791
HERRICK: _Aph. Night Piece, To Julia._

Ye stars! which are the poetry of Heaven,
If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
Of men and empires,--'t is to be forgiven,
That in our aspirations to be great,
Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,
And claim a kindred with you.
1792
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto iii., St. 88.

    Now only here and there a little star
Looks forth alone.

A thousand years scarce serve to form a state:
An hour may lay it in the dust.
1794
BYRON: _Ch. Harold,_ Canto ii., St. 84.


=Statesman.=

            An honest statesman to a prince,
Is like a cedar planted by a spring;
The spring bathes the tree's root, the grateful tree
Rewards it with his shadow.
1795
WEBSTER: _Duchess of Malfi,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.


=Steed.=

Hurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!
Hurrah, hurrah for horse and man!
And when their statues are placed on high,
Under the dome of the Union sky,--
The American soldier's Temple of Fame,--
There with the glorious General's name
Be it said in letters both bold and bright:
"Here is the steed that saved the day
By carrying Sheridan into the fight,
From Winchester,--twenty miles away!"
1796
THOMAS BUCHANAN READ: _Sheridan's Ride._

          Put a tongue
In every wound of Cæsar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
1797
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act iii., Sc. 2.


=Storms.=

            We often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
As hush as death.
1798
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act ii., Sc. 2.

God moves in a mysterious way
  His wonders to perform;
He plants his footsteps in the sea
  And rides upon the storm.
1799
COWPER: _Light Shining out of Darkness._

Nail to the mast her holy flag,
  Set every threadbare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,
  The lightning and the gale!

Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still question'd me the story of my life,
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortune,
That I have passed.
1801
SHAKS.: _Othello,_ Act i., Sc. 3.

                She thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her.
1802
SHAKS.: _Othello,_ Act i., Sc. 3.


=Strangers.=

By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honored, and by strangers mourn'd.

The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.
1804
SHAKS.: _Hamlet,_ Act i., Sc. 1.


=Strength.=

          O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

No fears to beat away, no strife to heal,--
The past unsighed for, and the future sure.
1807
WORDSWORTH: _Laodamia._


=Striving.=

How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell;
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
1808
SHAKS.: _King Lear,_ Act i., Sc. 4.


=Study.=

Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;
Small have continual plodders ever won,
Save base authority from others' books.
1809
SHAKS.: _Love's L. Lost,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

If not to some peculiar end design'd
Study 's the specious trifling of the mind,
Or is at best a secondary aim,
A chase for sport alone, and not for game.
1810
YOUNG: _Love of Fame,_ Satire ii., Line 67.

The lives of trees lie only in the barks,
And in their styles the wit of greatest clerks.

But we'll do more, Sempronius--we'll deserve it.
1814
ADDISON: _Cato,_ Act i., Sc. 2.


=Suffering.=

Yet tears to human suffering are due;
And mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown
Are mourned by man, and not by man alone.
1815
WORDSWORTH: _Laodamia._


=Suicide.=

Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
1816
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

           --He
That kills himself to avoid misery, fears it;
And at the best shows but a bastard valor.
1817
MASSINGER: _Maid of Honor,_ Act iv., Sc. 3.


=Summer.=

Eternal summer gilds them yet,
But all except their sun is set.
1818
Byron: _Don Juan,_ Canto iii., St. 86. 1.

   It is a sultry day; the sun has drunk
The dew that lay upon the morning grass;
There is no rustling in the lofty elm
That canopies my dwelling, and its shade
Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint
And interrupted murmur of the bee,
Settling on the sick flowers, and then again
Instantly on the wing.
1819
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT: _Summer Wind._


=Sun.=

                   The glorious sun,
Stays in his course, and plays the alchemist;
Turning, with splendor of his precious eye,
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold.
1820
SHAKS.: _King John,_ Act iii., Sc. 1.

Busy old fool, unruly sun,
Why dost thou thus,
Through windows and through curtains call on us?

The thickest cloud earth ever stretched.
1822
ROBERT BROWNING: _Apparent Failure,_ vii.


=Sunflower.=

Light enchanted sunflower, thou
Who gazest ever true and tender
On the sun's revolving splendor!
       *       *       *       *       *
Restless sunflowers, cease to move.
1823
SHELLEY: _Tr. of "Magico Prodigioso" of Calderon,_ Sc. 3.

The heart that has truly lov'd never forgets,
But as truly loves on to the close,
As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
The same look which she turn'd when he rose.
1824
MOORE: _Believe Me, If all Those Endearing Young Charms._

Miles and miles of gold and green
Where the sunflowers blow
In a solid glow.

Unloved, the sunflower, shining fair,
Ray round with flames her disk of seed.
1826
TENNYSON: _In Memoriam,_ Pt. ci., St. 2.


=Sunrise.=

When from the opening chambers of the east
The morning springs in thousand liveries drest,
The early larks their morning tribute pay,
And, in shrill notes, salute the blooming day.
1827
THOMSON: _The Morning in the Country._

'Tis morn. Behold the kingly Day now leaps
The eastern wall of earth with sword in hand,
Clad in a flowing robe of mellow light.
Like to a king that has regain'd his throne,
He warms his drooping subjects into joy,
That rise rejoiced to do him fealty,
And rules with pomp the universal world.
1828
JOAQUIN MILLER: _Ina,_ Sc. 2.

The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And, by the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.

O the wondrous golden sunset of the blest October day.
1830
JULIA C.R. DORR: _Margery Grey,_ St. 24.

          The descending sun
Seems to caress the city that he loves,
And crowns it with the aureole of a saint.

          The sun is going down,
And I must see the glory from the hill.
1832
GEORGE ELIOT: _Agatha._


=Sunshine.=

See the gold sunshine patching,
And streaming and streaking across
The gray-green oaks; and catching,
By its soft brown beard, the moss.
1833
BAILEY: _Festus,_ Sc. _The Surface._

As sunshine broken in the rill,
Though turned astray, is sunshine still.
1834

So every scope, by the immoderate use,
Turns to restraint.

The fool of nature stood with stupid eyes
And gaping mouth, that testified surprise.

The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
1838
SHAKS.:  _3 Henry VI.,_ Act v., Sc. 6.


=Swallow.=

When Autumn scatters his departing gleams,
Warned of approaching Winter, gathered, play
The swallow-people; and tossed wide around
O'er the calm sky, in convolution swift,
The feathered eddy floats; rejoicing once,
Ere to their wintry slumbers they retire.
1839
THOMSON: _Seasons, Autumn,_ Line 836.


=Swans.=

          The swan, with arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows
Her state with oary feet.

MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. vii., Line 438.


=Swearing.=

And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again.

Take not His name, who made thy mouth, in vain;
It gets thee nothing, and hath no excuse.

GEORGE PEELE: _Sonnet, Polyhymnia._


=Swimming.=

          How many a time have I
Cloven with arm still lustier, breast more daring,
The wave all roughen'd; with a swimmer's stroke
Flinging the billows back from my drench'd hair,
And laughing from my lip the audacious brine,
Which kiss'd it like a wine-cup, rising o'er
The waves as they arose, and prouder still
The loftier they uplifted me.
1847
BYRON: _Two Foscari,_ Act i., Sc. 1.

A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
1850

Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,
And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.

=Synods.=

Synods are mystical bear-gardens,
Where elders, deputies, church-wardens,
And other members of the court,
Manage the Babylonish sport.

Who so shall telle a tale after a man,
He moste reherse, as neighe as ever he can,
Everich word, if it be in his charge,
All speke he never so rudely and so large.
1853
CHAUCER: _Canterbury Tales, Prologue,_  Line 733.

To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul.

  In the grove at the end of the vale!

Talkers are no good doers; be assured
We go to use our hands, and not our tongues.

But still his tongue ran on, the less
Of weight it bore, with greater ease
And with its everlasting clack,
Set all men's ears upon the rack.

Improves with age and ripens by degrees.

Such and so various are the tastes of men.
1865
AKENSIDE: _Pl. of the Imagination,_ Bk. iii., Line 567.

And he who nothing pays, at taxes rails.

Our present tears here, not our present laughter,
Are but the handsells of our joys hereafter.

Thrice he assay'd, and thrice in spite of scorn,
Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth.
1873
MILTON: _Par. Lost,_ Bk. i., Line 619.

A child will weep a bramble's smart,
A maid to see her sparrow part,
A stripling for a woman's heart:

She sees the tears of bearded men.

Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
In looking on the happy Autumn fields,
And thinking of the days that are no more.

A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.
1879
SHAKS.: _Jul. Cæsar,_ Act i., Sc. 2.


=Temperance.=

Temp'rate in every place,--abroad, at home.

For sickness, age, and their attendant cares.
1880
CRABBE: _The Borough,_ Letter xvii., Line 198.


=Tempests.=

               The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes;
And, by his hollow whistling in the leaves,
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
1881
SHAKS.: _1 Henry IV.,_ Act v., Sc. 1.

Suddeine they see from midst of all the maine
The surging waters like a mountaine rise,

To swell above the measure of his guise,
As threatning to devoure all that his powre despise.

BYRON: _Sardanapalus,_ Act ii., Sc. 1.

Oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
Win us with honest trifles, to betray us
In deepest consequence.
1885
SHAKS.: _Macbeth,_ Act i., Sc. 3.

'Tis the temptation of the devil
That makes all human actions evil;
For saints may do the same things by
The spirit, in sincerity,
Which other men are tempted to,
And at the devil's instance do:
And yet the actions be contrary,
Just as the saints and wicked vary.
1886
BUTLER: _Hudibras,_ Pt. ii., Canto ii., Line 233.

Safe from temptation, safe from sin's pollution,
  She lives whom we call dead.

    Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech.

  What unto themselves was taught.

Made glorious summer by this sun of York.

On the wings of borrowed wit.

              Midnight hags,

Call fiends and spectres from the yawning deep,
And set the ministers of hell at work.
2077

Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure
Thrill the deepest notes of woe.
2080

The sound of his wind-swept voice on the air.

To temper man; we had been brutes without you.

Where is the man who has the power and skill
To stem the torrent of a woman's will?

2086
_Copied from the pillar erected on the mount in the
  Dane John Field, Canterbury._  [_Examiner_: May 31, 1829.]

Woman's at best a contradiction still.
Heaven, when it strives to polish all it can
Its last best work, but forms a softer man.
2087
POPE: _Moral Essays,_ Epis. ii., Line 269.

Earth's noblest thing, a woman perfected.

A ministering angel thou!

She'd make them newly, being what she was.

Time may restore us in his course
Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;
But where will Europe's latter hour
Again find Wordsworth's healing power?
2103
MATTHEW ARNOLD: _Memorial Verses._
