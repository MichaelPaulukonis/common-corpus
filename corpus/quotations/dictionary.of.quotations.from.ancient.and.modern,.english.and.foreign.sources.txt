PREFACE


The present "Book of Quotations" was undertaken in the belief that,
notwithstanding the many excellent compilations of the kind already in
existence, there was room for another that should glean its materials
from a wider area, and that should have more respect to the
requirements, both speculative and practical, of the times we live in.
The wide-spread materials at command had never yet been collected into a
single volume, and certain modern writings, fraught with a wisdom that
supremely deserves our regard, had hardly been quarried in at all.

The Editor has therefore studied to compile a more comprehensive
collection; embracing something of this wisdom, which naturally bears
more directly on the interests of the present day. To these interests
the Editor has all along had an eye, and he has been careful to collect,
from ancient sources as well as modern, sayings that seem to reveal an
insight into them, and bear pertinently upon them; they are such as are
specified on the title-page, and they are one and all more than passing
ones. The aphorisms which wise men have uttered on these vital topics
can never fail to deserve our regard, and they will prove edifying to
us, even should we, led by a higher wisdom, be inclined to say nay to
them. For, as it has been said, "The errors of a wise man are more
instructive than the truths of a fool. The wise man travels in lofty,
far-seeing regions; the fool in low-lying, high-fenced lanes; retracing
the footsteps of the former, to discover where he deviated, whole
provinces of the universe are laid open to us; in the path of the
latter, granting even that he has not deviated at all, little is laid
open to us but two wheel-ruts and two hedges."

The quotations collected in this book, (particularly those bearing on
the vital interests referred to,) are, it will be generally admitted,
the words of wise men; therefore the Editor has endeavoured to ascertain
and give the names of their authors, when not known. For, though the
truth and worth of the sayings are nowise dependent on their authorship,
it is well to know who those were that felt the burden they express,
and found relief in uttering them. What was of moment to them, may well
be of moment to others, and must be worthy of all regard and well
deserving of being laid to heart.

Except in the case of quotations from Shakespeare, the reader will
observe that the Editor has quoted only the names of the authors or the
books from which they are taken, and has not, as might be expected of
him, supplied either chapter or verse. The reason is, he did not think
it worth the labour and expense that would have been involved in doing
so, while the quotations given are for most part independent of the
context, and are perfectly intelligible in their own light. They are all
more or less of an aphoristic quality, and the meaning and application
are evident to any one who understands the subject of which they treat.

As for the other qualities of these quotations, they will be found to be
in general brief in expression and pointed in application, and not a few
of them winged as well as barbed. A great many are pregnant in meaning;
suggest more than they express; and are the coinage of minds of no
ordinary penetration and grasp of thought. While some of them are so
simple that a child might understand them, there are others that border
on regions in which the clearest-headed and surest-footed might stumble
and come to grief.

The collection might have been larger; the quarry of the literature of
the present century alone might have supplied materials for as big a
book. But the Editor's task was to produce a work that should embrace
gleanings from different fields of literature, and he could only
introduce from that of the present day as much as his limits allowed.
Yet, though the quantity given is no index of the quantity available,
the Editor hopes the reader will allow that his selection has not been
made in the dark, and that what he has given is of the true quality, as
well as enough in quantity for most readers to digest. If the quality be
good, the quantity is of little account, for what has been said of
Reason may be said of Wisdom which is its highest expression: "Whoso
hath any, hath access to the whole."

A word of explanation in regard to the Arrangement and the appended
Index:--

The Arrangement adopted may not at once commend itself, but it was found
to be the best; a topical one would have been too cumbersome, as, in
that case, it would have been frequently necessary to introduce the same
quotation under several different heads. The arrangement, it will be
seen, is alphabetical, and follows the order of the initial letters of
the initial word or words.

The Index, which is topical, was rendered necessary in consequence of
the arrangement followed, and, though a copious one, it only refers to
subjects of which there is anything of significance said. It does not
include mottoes, and rarely proverbs; for, apart from the difficulty of
indexing the latter, the attempt would almost have doubled the size of
the book, and rendered it altogether unwieldy. The Index, too, is
limited to subjects that are not in the alphabetical order in the body
of the book. Thus there was no need to index what is said on "Art," on
p. 18, on "Beauty," on p. 26, or on "Christianity," on pp. 42, 43, as
the reader will expect to find something concerning them where they
occur in the order adopted.

With these preliminary explanations the Editor leaves his book--the
pleasant labour of more than three years--in the hands of the public,
assured that they will judge of it by its own merits, and that they will
be generous enough to acquit him of having compiled either a superfluous
or an unserviceable work.

vulgar, lending, by casual extrinsic splendour,
the brightness and manifold glance
of the diamond to pebbles of no value.

serve mankind, / Should have small rest or

he held / A pouncet-box, which ever and
anon / He gave his nose, and took 't away
again. Hen. IV., i. 3.

The hours my friend devotes
to me were snatched from a higher society.
Thoreau.

Friendship can originate and acquire permanence
only practically (pracktisch). Liking
(Neigung), and even love, contribute nothing
to friendship. True, active, productive friendship
consists in this, that we keep the same
pace (gleichen Schritt) in life, that my friend
approves of my aims, as I of his, and that
thus we go on steadfastly (unverrückt) together,
whatever may be the difference
otherwise between our ways of thinking and
living. Goethe.

Friendship canna stand a' on ae side. Sc.

Friendship is infinitely better than kindness.
Cic.

Friendship is like a debt of honour; the                            25

armourers, accomplishing the knights, /
With busy hammers closing rivets up, / Give

ripe and good one; / Exceeding wise, fair-spoken,

wear, to-morrow puts it on another's back.
Fielding.

Greatness is not a teachable nor gainable                           45
thing, but the expression of the mind of a
God-made man: teach, or preach, or labour
as you will, everlasting difference is set
between one man's capacity and another's;
and this God-given supremacy is the priceless
thing, always just as rare in the world
at one time as another.... And nearly the
best thing that men can generally do is to
set themselves, not to the attainment, but
the discovery of this: learning to know
gold, when we see it, from iron-glance, and
diamond from flint-sand, being for most of
us a more profitable employment than trying
to make diamonds of our own charcoal.
Ruskin.

opinion. Emerson.

others / As feel in his own fall. Troil. and

prosperity carry a man never so little beyond
his poise, it overbears and dashes him
to pieces. Colton.

The wise man's fetter and the rage of fools.
Otway.

Greatness, with private men / Esteem'd a                             5

from our high births they conclude / The
only free men, are the only slaves: / Happy
the golden mean. Massinger.

Lies in his bed, walks up and down with

words, / Remembers me of all his gracious
parts, / Stuffs out his vacant garments with
his form: / Then have I reason to be fond
of grief. King John, iii. 4.

Grief finds some ease by him that like doth                         20
bear. Spenser.

happiness ever can, and common sufferings
are far stronger links than common joys.

Grief makes one hour ten. Rich. II., i. 3.

to the development of intelligence, energy,
and virtue. Fearon.

sedate, / Conforming, cleansing, raising,
making free. Aubrey de Vere (the younger).

Grief should be the instructor of the wise; /

most / Must mourn the deepest o'er the
fatal truth, / The Tree of Knowledge is not

the bullet being at the mark before the
noise is heard, so that it maketh a noise not

Homer's Epos has not ceased to be true; yet
is no longer our Epos, but shines in the distance,

before we can so much as know that 'twas
a sun.... For all things, even celestial
luminaries, much more atmospheric meteors,
have their rise, their culmination, their decline.

comparison to the adroitest flow of words
without heroic insight! Carlyle.

drums, no tramp of squadrons, or immeasurable
tumult of baggage-waggons, attends
its movements; in what obscure and sequestered

it will rule not over, but in all heads,
and bend the world to its will. Carlyle.

choice, / Rules the bold hand or prompts
the suppliant voice. Johnson.

great man the exception rather than the
rule of his conduct! Such perverse worship

sun without emotion, but who, when he is
in eclipse, come forward with hymns and
cymbals to adore him. Canning.

none enquire if good he be or no. Herrick.

consigned, / Our own felicity we make or
find. Johnson.

in Paradise so soon fell from innocence?

night, / Like softest music to attending ears!

devotedness to the good and true, otherwise

brother Sleep! / One, pale as yonder waning

wave, / It blushes o'er the world: / Yet both
so passing wonderful. Shelley.

written. Goethe.

a female pedant. Goldsmith.

are mere personifications. We have not a

darkness, like two spectres, Fear and

made of it that is productive of real benefit.

divided, but the men; divided into mere
segments of men, broken into small fragments

with everything profound, past, present, or

they are condensed, the deeper they burn.

It may indeed be that man is frightfully
threshed at times by public and domestic
ill-fortune, but the ruthless destiny, if it

Liberty, and not theology, is the enthusiasm
of the nineteenth century. The very men
who would once have been conspicuous
saints are now conspicuous revolutionists,
for while their heroism and disinterestedness
are their own, the direction which these
qualities take is determined by the pressure
of the age. H. W. Lecky.

Liberty comes with Christianity, because
Christianity develops and strengthens the
mass of men. Ward Beecher.

grafted upon justice. Mme. Swetchine.

Liberty has no crueller enemy than license.
Fr. Pr.

Liberty is a principle; its community is its
security; exclusiveness is its doom. Kossuth.

Liberty is a slow fruit. It is never cheap; it is
made difficult because freedom is the accomplishment
and perfectness of man. Emerson.

Liberty is an old fact; it has had its heroes                       25
and its martyrs in almost every age. Chapin.

Liberty is God's gift; liberties are the devil's.

use of time. To be free is not to be doing
nothing; it is to be one's own master as to
what one ought to do or not to do. La
Bruyère.

Liberty is of more value than any gifts; and
to receive gifts is to lose it. Be assured
that men most commonly seek to oblige thee
only that they may engage thee to serve
them. Saadi.

Liberty is one of the most precious gifts that
Heaven has bestowed on man, and captivity
is the greatest evil that can befall him.
Cervantes.

growth, the result of free individual action,
energy, and independence. S. Smiles.

Liberty is the right of doing whatever the
laws permit. Montesquieu.

Liberty is to the collective body what health

little more than the choice of working or
starving. Johnson.

Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of

Burke.

and to those pious frauds on which it is commonly
founded. Hume.

Liberty raises us to the gods; holiness prostrates
us on the ground. Amiel.

Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant
of rapid growth. Washington.

Liberty will not descend to a people; a people                      40
must raise themselves to liberty; it is a
blessing that must be earned before it can
be enjoyed. Colton.

Liberty, with all its drawbacks, is everywhere
vastly more attractive to a noble soul than
good social order without it, than society
like a flock of sheep, or a machine working
like a watch. This mechanism makes of
man only a product; liberty makes him the
citizen of a better world. Schiller.

Liberum arbitrium--Free will.

putteth the affections into a false gallop.

fears the rein. Rowe.

Lying is a breach of promise; for whoever

word that he speaks is the man himself.
Carlyle.

he has no other possession but Hope; this
world of his is emphatically the Place of
Hope. Carlyle.

Man is quite sufficiently saddened by his own
passions and destiny, and need not make
himself more so by the darkness of a barbaric
past. He needs enlightening and
cheering influences, and should therefore
turn to those eras in art and literature
during which remarkable men obtained perfect
culture. Goethe.

Man is so inconsistent a creature that it is
impossible to reason from his belief to his
conduct, or from one part of his belief to
another. Macaulay.

Man is so prone to occupy himself with what
is most common, the soul and the senses are
so easily blunted to the impressions of the
beautiful and perfect, that one ought by all
means to preserve the capability of feeling
it. We ought every day at least to hear a
little song, read a good poem, see an excellent
painting, and, if possible, speak a few
reasonable words. Goethe.

Man is that noble endogenous plant which
grows, like the palm, from within outward.
Emerson.

just so far as the need is. Emerson.

Man is the higher sense of our planet, the                          10
star which connects it with the upper world,
the eye which it turns towards heaven.
Novalis.

Man is the jewel of God, who has created this
material world to keep his treasure in. Theo.
Parker.

Man is the maker of expedients, but not of
laws. In his solicitude as to his approaching
lot, he has neither time nor desire to raise
his eyes to the heavens to watch and record
their phenomena; no leisure to look upon
himself and consider what and where he
is. In the imperious demand for a present
support, he dare not venture on speculative
attempts at ameliorating his state; he is
doomed to be a helpless, isolated, spellbound
savage, or, if not isolated, the companion
of other savages as careworn as
himself. Draper.

Man is the merriest species of the creation.
Addison.

Man is the Messiah of Nature. Novalis.

servant not of the devil and chaos, but of

Man is the sun of the world; more than the                          20
real sun. The fire of his wonderful heart
is the only light and heat worth gauge or
measure. Where he is, are the tropics;
where he is not, the ice-world. Ruskin.

Man is the weeping animal born to govern
all the rest. Pliny.

Man is the whole encyclopedia of facts. The
creation of a thousand forests is in one
acorn; and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul,
Britain, America, lie enfolded already in
the first man. Emerson.

Man is the will and woman is the sentiment.
In this ship of humanity, Will is the rudder
and Sentiment the sail; when woman affects
to steer, the rudder is only a masked sail.
Emerson.

Man is to man the sorest, surest ill.... /
Earth trembles ere her yawning jaws devour;
/ And smoke betrays the wide-consuming
fire; / Ruin from man is most conceal'd
when near, / And sends the dreadful
tidings in the blow. Young.

Man is too near all kinds of beasts--a fawning                      25

wolf, a dissembling crocodile, a treacherous
decoy, a rapacious vulture. Cowley.

aber kein starker, kühner Denker ohne
dasselbe sein--Without feeling one may be
a clear thinker, but not a powerful and a bold.
Klinger.

Man kann in wahrer Freiheit leben / Und
doch nicht ungebunden sein--One may enjoy
true freedom, and yet be in chains. Goethe.

Man kann nicht stets das Fremde meiden, /
Das Gute liegt uns oft so fern. / Ein
echter deutscher Mann mag keinen Franzen
leiden, / Doch ihre Weine trinkt er gern--We
cannot always avoid what is foreign; what
is good often lies so far off. A true German
cannot abide the French, and yet he will drink
their wines with the most genuine relish. Goethe.

Man kann nicht wider sein Geshick--There is
no striving against one's fate. Schiller.

from experience. Wieland.

stand on made manifest. Carlyle.

Man, living, feeling man, is the easy sport of
the overmastering present. Schiller.

man über sein Werk sein Lob vergisst--We
first truly praise an artist when the merit of his
work is such as to make us forget himself.
Lessing.

Man löst sich nicht allmählich von dem Leben!--It
is by no gradual process we detach ourselves
from (lose our hold of) life. Schiller.

Man loves before he sees; his heart is open
before his eyes; love must irradiate his
world for him before he well knows he is in
it, what it is made of, and what to make of
it. Ed.

Man loves little and often, woman much and
rarely. Basta.

Man, made of the dust of the world, does not
forget his origin; and all that is yet inanimate
will one day speak and reason.

wenn man sie los werden will, und dann hat
man noch von Glück zu sagen--Men must
pay dearly for their errors, if they would be free
from them, and then they may regard it a happiness
to do so. Goethe.

Man muss, will man ein Glück geniessen, /
Die Freiheit zu behaupten wissen--If we
would enjoy what fortune gives us, we must
know how to maintain our freedom. Gellert.

is comprehensible, otherwise
he would not search. Goethe.

for Meas., ii. 2.

Man reconciles himself to almost every event,                       30

in das heitere Gebiet der Kunst, / Und für
die Kränkungen der Wirklichkeit / Sucht

Goethe.

were ascribed to coloured precious stones
may have arisen out of the deep feeling of
this inexpressible pleasure. Goethe.

Men no sooner find their appetites unanswered
than they complain the times are injurious.

letters are frequent; but a true gentleman

they are apt to go out of the common
road by the quickness of their imagination.
Swift.

by transgressing most truly kept the law.

they are not good in their own, and run
back to their own because they pass for
nothing in the new places. Emerson.

Why, so does every tree that buds, and
every bird that rises as it sings. Men say
their aisles are good for worship. Why, so

Mental prayer (mentale Gebet), which includes
and excludes all religions, and only in a
few God-favoured men permeates the whole
course of life, develops itself in most men as
only a blazing, beatific feeling of the moment,
immediately after the vanishing of which the
man, thrown in upon himself unsatisfied and
unoccupied, lapses back into the most utter
and absolute weariness. Goethe.

Mentally and bodily endowed men are the                              5

a great deal more of themselves. Goethe.

[Greek: Metabolê pantôn glyky]--There is always a
pleasure in variety. Euripides.

Metaphysicians and philosophers are, on the
whole, the greatest troubles the world has
got to deal with.... Busy metaphysicians

people, and weaving cobwebs among the
finest wheels of the world's business, and
are, as much as possible, by all prudent
persons, to be brushed out of their way.
Ruskin.

is that wisdom of thought which was
before all physics, lives with it, and will endure
after it. Goethe.

My strength is as the strength of ten, because
my heart is pure. Tennyson.

My way of life / Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow                25
leaf; / And that which should accompany
old age, / As honour, love, obedience, troops

their stead, / Curses, not loud, but deep,
mouth-honour, breath / Which the poor
heart would fain deny, but dare not. Macb.,

roots a man has struck into his native soil;
no tree that grows is rooted so. Carlyle.

National character varies as it fades under invasion                45

Nations and men are only the best when they
are the gladdest, and deserve heaven when
they enjoy it. Jean Paul.

Nations are only transitional forms of humanity;

them than there is an immobility for an embryo
or any one of the manifold forms passed
through in its progress of development.
Draper.

Nations, like individuals, are born, proceed
through a predestined growth, and die. One
comes to its end at an early period and in an
untimely way; another, not until it has
gained maturity. One is cut off by feebleness
in its infancy, another is destroyed by
civil disease, another commits political suicide,
another lingers in old age. But for
every one there is an orderly way of progress
to its final term, whatever that term
may be. Draper.

Nature, how we bow to thee even against our
will. Sen.

Natural abilities are like natural plants, that
need pruning by study; and studies themselves
do give forth directions too much at
large, except they be bounded in by experience.
Bacon.

Natural abilities can almost make up for the
want of every kind of cultivation, but no cultivation
for want of natural abilities. Schopenhauer.

Natural knowledge is come at by the continuance
and progress of learning and of liberty,
and by particular persons attending to, comparing,
and pursuing intimations scattered
up and down it, which are overlooked and
disregarded by the generality of the world.
Bishop Butler.

Natural objects always did and do weaken,                           15
deaden, and obliterate imagination in me.

Nature alone is permanent. Longfellow.

Nature alone knows what she means. Goethe.

Nature always leaps to the surface, and manages                     25
to show what she is. Boileau.

Nature always speaks of spirit. Emerson.

Nature always wears the colours of the spirit.
To a man labouring under calamity the
heat of his own fire hath sadness in it.
Emerson.

Nature and art are too grand to go forth in
pursuit of aims; nor is it necessary that they
should, for there are relations everywhere,
and relations constitute life. Goethe.

Nature and books belong to the eyes that see
them. It depends on the mood of the man
whether he shall see the sunset or the fine
poem. Emerson.

Nature and Heaven command you, at your                              30
peril, to discern worth from unworth in
everything, and most of all in man. Ruskin.

Nature and love cannot be concealed. Ger.

light. Pope.

Nature and truth, though never so low or
vulgar, are yet pleasing when openly and
artlessly represented. Pope.

Nature builds upon a false bottom, seeks herself
what she values in others, and is oftentimes
deceived and disappointed. Grace reposes
her whole hope and love in God, and
is never mistaken, never deluded by false
expectations. Thomas à Kempis.

Nature cannot be surprised in undress. Beauty                       35
breaks in everywhere. Emerson.

Nature cannot but always act rightly, quite
unconcerned as to what may be the consequences.
Goethe.

Nature counts nothing that she meets with
base, / But lives and loves in every place.
Tennyson.

Nature, crescent, does not grow alone / In thews
and bulk; but, as this temple waxes, / The
inward service of the mind and soul / Grows
wide withal. Ham., i. 3.

Nature does more than supply materials; she
also supplies powers. J. S. Mill.

Nature does not cocker us; we are children,                         40
not pets; she is not fond; everything is
dealt to us without fear or favour, after
severe, universal laws. Emerson.

Nature does not like to be observed, and likes
that we should be her fools and playmates.
Emerson.

Nature does not make all great men, more
than all other men, in the self-same mould.
Carlyle.

Nature draws with greater force than seven
oxen. Ger. Pr.

Nature ever provides for her own exigencies.
Sen.

Nature fashions no creature without implanting
in it the strength needful for its action
and duration. Carlyle.

Nature forces on our heart a Creator; history,
a Providence. Jean Paul.

Nature gives healthy children much; how
much! Wise education is a wise unfolding
of this; often it unfolds itself better of its
own accord. Goethe.

Nature gives you the impression as if there
were nothing contradictory in the world;
and yet, when you return back to the dwelling-place
of man, be it lofty or low, wide or
narrow, there is ever somewhat to contend
with, to battle with, to smooth and put to
rights. Goethe.

Nature glories in death more than in life. The                       5
month of departure is more beautiful than the
month of coming.... Every green thing
loves to die in bright colours. Ward Beecher.

Nature goes her own way; and all that to us
seems an exception, is really according to
order. Goethe.

Nature had made occupation a necessity;
society makes it a duty; habit may make it
a pleasure. Capelle.

Nature has directly formed woman to be a
mother, only indirectly to be a wife; man,
on the contrary, is rather made to be a husband
than a father. Jean Paul.

Nature has given to each one all that as a
man he needs, which it is the business of
education to develop, if, as most frequently
happens, it does not develop better of itself.
Goethe.

Nature has lent us tears--the cry of suffering                      10
when the man at last can bear it no longer.
Goethe.

Nature has made man's breast no windows /
To publish what he does within doors, / Nor
what dark secrets there inhabit, / Unless his
own rash folly blab it. Butler.

Nature has made provision for all her children;
the meanest is not hindered in its existence
even by that of the most excellent. Goethe.

Nature has no feeling; the sun gives his light
to good and bad alike, and moon and stars
shine out for the worst of men as for the
best. Goethe.

Nature has no moods; they belong to man
alone. Auerbach.

Nature has planted passions in the heart of                         15
man for the wisest purposes both of religion

Nine times out of ten it is over the Bridge of
Sighs that we pass the narrow gulf from
youth to manhood. That interval is usually
occupied by an ill-placed or disappointed

it has passed. The mind profits by the
wrecks of every passion, and we may measure
our road to wisdom by the sorrows we
have undergone. Bulwer Lytton.

stream. Ovid.

discover nothing but what is to be learned
from them. Johnson.

walk in some narrow way of life, will ever
have any moral character, any clearness of

tenderness or strength of heart. Ed.

of his outward show; which, God he knows, /
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.

insect is still but an insect at most, / Though
it crawl on the head of a queen. Burns.

No more subtle master under heaven / Than                           20
is the maiden-passion for a maid, / Not only
to keep down the base in man, / But teach
high thought, and amiable words / And courtliness,

a good home life. J. G. Holland.

No nation can bear wealth that is not intelligent
first. Ward Beecher.

No nation can reform itself, as the English are
now trying to do, by what their newspapers
call "tremendous cheers." Reform is not
joyous, but grievous; no single man can
reform himself without stern suffering and
stern working; how much less can a nation
of men! Medea, when she made men young
again, was wont to hew them in pieces with
meat-axes; cast them into caldrons, and boil
them for a length of time. How much handier
could they have but done it by "tremendous
cheers" alone! Carlyle.

Sir P. Sydney.

Nobilitatis virtus non stemma character--Virtue,

bear a rival in the throng. Young.

feeling with other people. Goethe.

Nothing in the dealings of Heaven with Earth
is so wonderful to me as the way in which
the evil angels are allowed to spot, pervert,
and bring to nothing, or to worse, the powers
of the greatest men: so that Greece must be
ruined, for all that Plato can say; Geneva,
for all that Calvin can say; England, for all

outcome to Europe of the school of Weimar.

what they would be at. Goethe.

greatest genius, without the intellectual
gift labour alone will do little. Haydon.

immediately see and hear close around us.

Novels are tales of adventures which did not
occur in God's creation, but only in the
waste chambers (to be let unfurnished) of
certain human heads, and which are part
and parcel only of the sum of nothings;
which, nevertheless, obtain some temporary
remembrance, and lodge extensively at this
epoch of the world in similar, still more unfurnished,
chambers. Carlyle.

Novels are the journal or record of manners;                        20
and the new importance of these books
derives from the fact that the novelist begins
to penetrate the surface, and treat this
part of life more worthily. Emerson.

Novels for most part instil into young minds

to be aged in any kind of course, as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertaking.

blown youth / Blasted with ecstacy: O, woe
is me, / To have seen what I have seen, see
what I see. Ham., iii. 2.

Now the heart is so full that a drop overfills
it; / We are happy now, because God wills

the garden, / And choke the herbs for
want of husbandry. 2 Hen. VI., iii. 1.

good we oft might win / By fearing to attempt.

heart. Keble.

they rend it lightly, and pour out its ashes.

if one be gone; / Strange that a harp of

become one. Novalis.

Our life is not a mutual helpfulness; but rather,
cloaked under due laws of war, named "fair
competition," and so forth, it is a mutual hostility.

we make it. Emerson.

we come upon it. Goethe.

Our memories are independent of our wills.
Sheridan.

Our minds cannot be empty; and evil will
break in upon them if they are not pre-occupied
by good. Johnson.

of excellence. Joshua Reynolds.

Our moral impressions invariably prove strongest
in those moments when we are most
driven back upon ourselves. Goethe.

the common food of daily life. Contentment

and quiet pleasures. Ward Beecher.

Our narrow ken / Reaches too far, when all
that we behold / Is but the havoc of wide-wasting
Time, / Or what he soon shall spoil.

the top. Beaumont and Fletcher.

forms our true honour. Coleridge.

straightway from its ashes. Goethe.

Our path of glory / By many a cloud is darken'd
and unblest. Keble.

Our peasant (Burns) showed himself among
us, "a soul like an Æolian harp, in whose
strings the vulgar wind, as it passed through
them, changed itself into articulate melody."

parliamentary. F. G. Trafford.

Our poetry of the eighteenth century was
prose; our prose of the seventeenth, poetry.
Hare.

Our poets are men of talents who sing, and
not the children of music. Emerson.

Our present time is indeed a criticising and
a critical time, hovering between the wish
and the inability to believe. Jean Paul.

Our purity of taste is best tested by its universality,              5
for if we can only admire this thing
or that, we may be sure that our cause for
liking is of a finite and false nature. Ruskin.

Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor.
Tam. of the Shrew, iv. 3.

Our ravings and complaints are but like arrows
shot up into the air at no mark, and so to no
purpose, but only to fall back upon our own
heads and destroy ourselves. Sir William
Temple.

Our relation to things outside of ourselves
forms, and at the same time robs us of, our
existence, and yet we have to do our best
to adapt ourselves to circumstances; for
to isolate one's self is also not advisable.
Goethe.

Our relations are far too artificial and complicated,
our nutriment and mode of life are
without their proper nature, and our social
intercourse is without proper love and goodwill.
Every one is polished and courteous,
but no one has the courage to be hearty and
true. Goethe.

Our relations are ours by lot, our friends by                       10
election. Delille.

Our religion assumes the negative form of rejection.
Out of love of the true, we repudiate
the false; and the religion is an abolishing
criticism. Emerson.

Our religion is meant to root out our vices,
but it covers, nourishes, and excites them.
Montaigne.

Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, / Which
we ascribe to heaven. All's Well, i. 1.

Our sacrifices are rarely of an active kind; we,
as it were, abandon what we give away. It
is not from resolution, but despair, that we
renounce our property. Goethe.

Our self-made men are the glory of our institutions.                15
Wendell Phillips.

Our senses will not admit of anything extreme:
too much noise confuses us, too much light
dazzles us. Pascal.

Our social forms are very far from truth and
equity. Emerson.

Our sorrows are like thunder-clouds, which
seem black in the distance, but grow lighter
as they approach. Jean Paul.

of Nature's grandeur before we
can fully comprehend the greatness of man.

are but fettered by chains of our own forging,

asunder. Carlyle.

Emerson.

Our stomach for good fortune is bottomless, but
the entrance to it is narrow. Schopenhauer.

Our thoughts are often worse than we are,
just as they are often better. George Eliot.

Our thoughts take wildest flight / Even at the
moment when they should array themselves
in pensive order. Byron.

Our time is fixed, and all our days are numbered;
/ How long, how short, we know
not: this we know, / Duty requires we
calmly wait the summons, / Nor dare to stir
till Heaven shall give permission. Blair.

Our torment is unbelief, the uncertainty as to                      30
what we ought to do, the distrust of the
value of what we do, and the distrust that
the necessity which we all at last believe in
is fair and beneficial. Emerson.

Our valours are our best gods. Fletcher.

Our vanity is the constant enemy of our dignity.
Mme. Swetchine.

Our very hopes belied our fears, / Our fears
our hopes belied; / We thought her dying
when she slept, / And sleeping when she
died. T. Hood.

Our virtues are dearer to us the more we have
had to suffer for them. It is the same with
our children. All profound affection admits
a sacrifice. Vauvenargues.

Our virtues depend on our failings as their                         35
root, and the latter send forth as strong
and manifold branches underground as the
former do in the open light. Goethe.

Our / Virtues lie in the interpretation of the
time. Coriolanus, iv. 7.

Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped
them not; and our crimes would despair if
they were not cherished by our virtues. All's
Well, iv. 3.

Our whole existence is passed into words, and
words, by means of tongue and ears, pass so
easily into the soul. Jean Paul.

Our whole life is but a chamber which we are
frescoing with colours, that do not appear
while being laid on wet, but which will shine
forth afterwards when finished and dry.
Ward Beecher.

Our whole terrestrial being is based on Time                        40
and built of Time; it is wholly a movement,
a Time-impulse; Time is the author of it,
the material of it. Carlyle.

Our wills and fates do so contrary run, /
That our devices still are overthrown; / Our
thoughts are ours, their ends none of our
own. Ham., iii. 2.

Our work must be done honourably and thoroughly,
because we are now men; whether
we ever expect to be angels, or ever were
slugs, being practically no matter. We are
now human creatures, and must, at our peril,
do human, that is to say, affectionate, honest,
and earnest work. Ruskin.

Our works are presentiments of our capabilities.
Goethe.

Our works decay and disappear, / God's frailest
works abide, and look / Down on the ruins we
toil to rear. Dr. Walter Smith.

Our worst misfortunes never happen, and
most miseries lie in anticipation. Balzac.

Our yesterday's to-morrow now is gone, / And
still a new to-morrow does come on. / We
by to-morrow draw out all our store, / Till
the exhausted well can yield no more.
Cowley.

Our young men are terribly alike. Alexander
Smith.

Ourselves are easily provided for; it is nothing
but the circumstantials of human life that
cost so much. Pope.

Out at sea, the universe has dwindled to a                           5

with you day after day, and to which you
seem bound by some enchantment. Burroughs.

out of the salvation, the grateful heart; out
of endurance, fortitude; out of deliverance,
faith. Ruskin.

Out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower
safety. 1 Hen. IV., ii. 3.

Out upon the tempest of anger, the acrimonious
gall of fretful impatience, the sullen
frost of lowring resentment, or the corroding
poison of withered envy! They eat up the
immortal part of a man!... like traitor
Iscariot, betray their lord and master.
Burns.

spoudês]--Nothing in the affairs of mankind is
worth serious anxiety. Plato.

tedious business. Fr.

Over the events of life we may have a control,

here. Goethe.

Overcome evil with good. St. Paul.                                25

greater weight it is obliged to sustain.
Goldsmith.

for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the
law. St. Paul.

Oysters are not good in a month that hath not
an R in it. Pr.

contradict themselves much more rarely than
those who try to be consistent. Holmes.

throw stones. Pr.

People would do well if, tarrying here for
years together, they observed a while a
Pythagorean silence. Goethe.

People would do well if they would keep piety,
which is so essential and lovable in life, distinct
from art, where, owing to its very simplicity
and dignity, it checks their energy,
allowing only the very highest mind freedom
to unite with, if not actually to master, it.
Goethe.

Perfect works are rare, because they must be
produced at the happy moment when taste
and genius unite: and this rare conjunction,
like that of certain planets, appears to occur
only after the revolution of several cycles,
and only lasts for an instant. Chateaubriand.

Perfecting is our destiny, but perfection is
never our lot. J. C. Weber.

Perfection is not the affair of the scholar; it is

relations; nomadism, continual change, is
prohibitory of any good whatsoever. Carlyle.

Permanence, perseverance, persistence in spite                      30
of hindrances, discouragements, and "impossibilities:"
it is this that in all things distinguishes

civilised burgher from the nomadic savage--the

qualities most valuable for all men who
would mount, but especially for those who
have to step out of the crowd. Disraeli.

spear-proof crest of rugged danger. Harvard.

attainable that are possible. Chesterfield.

Personæ mutæ--Mute characters in a play.                            50

Personal attachment is no fit ground for public
conduct, and those who declare they will
take care of the rights of the sovereign
because they have received favours at his
hand, betray a little mind and warrant the
conclusion that if they did not receive those
favours they would be less mindful of their
duties, and act with less zeal for his interest.
C. Fox.

Personal force never goes out of fashion. (?)

Personality is everything in art and poetry.
Goethe.

Persons are love's world, and the coldest philosopher
cannot recount the debt of the young
soul, wandering here in nature to the power
of love, without being tempted to unsay, as
treasonable to nature, aught derogatory to
the social instincts. Emerson.

Persons of fine manners make behaviour the
first sign of force,--behaviour, and not performance,
or talent, or, much less, wealth.
Emerson.

Persons who are very plausible and excessively                       5

Peuples libres, souvenez-vous de cette maxime:
on peut acquérir la liberté, mais on ne la
retrouve jamais--Free people, remember this
rule: you may acquire liberty, but never regain
it if you once lose it. Rousseau.

Phaeton was his father's heir; born to attain
the highest fortune without earning it; he
had built no sun-chariot (could not build the
simplest wheel-barrow), but could and would
insist on driving one; and so broke his
own stiff neck, sent gig and horses spinning
through infinite space, and set the universe
on fire. Carlyle.

[Greek: phantasmata theia, kai skiai tôn ontôn]--Divine
phantasms and shadows of things that are. Gr.

"Philistine" must have originally meant, in the
mind of those who invented the nickname,

Philologists, who chase / A panting syllable
through time and space, / Start it at home,
and hunt it in the dark / To Gaul, to Greece,
and into Noah's ark. Cowper.

Philosophers are only men in armour after all. 35
Dickens.

Philosophers call God "the great unknown."
"The great misknown" would be more correct.
Joseph Roux.

Philosophia simulari potest, eloquentia non
potest--Philosophy may be feigned, eloquence
cannot. Quinct.

Philosophy and theology are become theorem,
brain-web and shadow, wherein no earnest
soul can find solidity for itself. Shadow, I
say; yet shadow projected from an everlasting
reality within ourselves. Quit the
shadow, seek the reality. Carlyle to John
Sterling.

Philosophy can add to our happiness in no
other manner but by diminishing our misery;
it should not pretend to increase our present
stock, but make us economists of what we
are possessed of. Goldsmith.

Philosophy can bake no bread; but she can                           40
procure for us God, freedom, immortality.
Which, then, is more practical--philosophy
or economy? Novalis.

Philosophy does not regard pedigree; she did
not receive Plato as a noble, but she made
him so. Sen.

Philosophy dwells aloft in the Temple of
Science, the divinity of its inmost shrine;
her dictates descend among men, but she herself
descends not; whoso would behold her
must climb with long and laborious effort,
nay, still linger in the forecourt, till manifold
trial have proved him worthy of admission
into the interior solemnities. Carlyle.

Philosophy easily triumphs over past and
future ills, but present ills triumph over
philosophy. La Roche.

and in every assertion keeps a doubt in
reserve. Froude.

Philosophy has given several plausible rules                        45
for attaining peace and tranquillity, but
they fall very much short of bringing men
to it. Tillotson.

Philosophy is a bully that talks very loud when
the danger is at a distance; but the moment
she is hard pressed by the enemy, she is not
to be found at her post, but leaves the brunt
of the battle to be borne by her humbler but
steadier comrade, Religion. Colton.

Philosophy is a good horse in a stable, but an
arrant jade on a journey. Goldsmith.

Philosophy is an elegant thing, if any one
modestly meddles with it; but, if he is conversant
with it more than is becoming, it
corrupts the man. Plato.

Philosophy is but a continual battle against
custom; an ever-renewed effort to transcend
the sphere of blind custom, and so become
transcendental. Carlyle.

Philosophy is no more than the art of making
ourselves happy; that is, of seeking pleasure
in regularity, and reconciling what we
owe to society with what is due to ourselves.

Philosophy is properly home-sickness; the
wish to be everywhere at home. Novalis.

Philosophy is reason with the eyes of the soul.

Philosophy, rightly defined, is simply the love
of wisdom. Cic.

Philosophy teaches us to do willingly and                           10

Phœnices primi, famæ si creditur, ausi / Mansuram                   15
rudibus vocem signare figuris--The
Phœnicians, if rumour may be trusted, were
the first who dared to write down the fleeting
word in rude letters. Lucan.

Physic, for the most part, is nothing else but
the substitute of exercise and temperance.
Addison.

Physic is of little use to a temperate person,
for a man's own observation on what he
finds does him good or what hurts him, is
the best physic to preserve health. Bacon.

Physical courage, which despises all danger,
will make a man brave in one way; and
moral courage, which defies all opinion, will
make a man brave in another. Colton.

Physical science has taught us to associate
Deity with the normal rather than with the
abnormal. Lecky.

Physician, heal thyself. Heb. Pr.                                 20

Piety is a kind of modesty. It makes us cast
down our thoughts, just as modesty makes
us cast down our eyes in presence of whatever
is forbidden. Joubert.

Piety is not a religion, although it is the soul
of all religions. Joubert.

Piety is only a means whereby, through purest

Plato enim mihi unus est instar omnium--Plato
alone in my regard is worth them all. Antimachus,
in Cic.

Plato's scheme was impossible even in his own                       20
day, as Bacon's "New Atlantis" in his day,
as Calvin's reform in his day, as Goethe's
"Academe" in his. Out of the good there
was in all these men, the world gathered
what it could find of evil, made its useless
Platonism out of Plato, its graceless Calvinism
out of Calvin, determined Bacon to
be the meanest of mankind, and of Goethe
gathered only a luscious story of seduction,
and daintily singable devilry. Ruskin.

companions. Charron.

Pleasure and revenge / Have ears more deaf

Pleasure and sympathy in things is all that is
real and again produces reality; all else is

but endeavour never does. Jean Paul.

Pleasure which cannot be obtained but by unreasonable

always end in pain. Johnson.

of another's pain, can never be such as a
worthy mind can fully delight in. Johnson.

Zimmermann.

Pledges taken of faithless minds, / I hold them

Poetry is inspiration; has in it a certain spirituality              5
and divinity which no dissecting knife
will discover; arises in the most secret and
most sacred region of man's soul, as it were
in our Holy of Holies; and as for external
things, depends only on such as can operate
in that region; among which it will be found
that Acts of Parliament and the state of
Smithfield Markets nowise play the chief
parts. Carlyle.

Poetry is music in words, and music is poetry
in sound; both excellent sauce, but they
have lived and died poor that made them

sound mind speaking after the ideal, and not
after the apparent. Emerson.

of life and to make man contented

Poetry, were it the rudest, so it be sincere, is
the attempt which man makes to render his

whole feelings, opinions, activity, and takes
its character from these. It may be called
the music of the whole inner being. Carlyle.

and tell them. Bailey.

Poets are liberating gods; they are free and
make free. Emerson.

Poets are natural sayers, sent into the world
for the end of expression. Emerson.

Poets are never young in one sense. Their                           40

eternity, which coarser souls must travel
towards for scores of years before their dull
sense is touched by them. A moment's insight

got, / Could it be known what they discreetly
blot. Waller.

Poets of old date, being privileged with senses,
had also enjoyed external Nature; but chiefly
as we enjoy the crystal cup which holds good
or bad liquor for us; that is to say, in silence,
or with slight incidental commentary; never,
as I compute, till after the "Sorrows of Werter"
was there man found who would say:
Come, let us make a description: Having
drunk the liquor, Come, let us eat the glass.
Carlyle.

Poets should be lawgivers; that is, the boldest
lyric inspiration should not chide and insult,
but should announce and lead the civil code,
the day's work. Emerson.

Poets should turn philosophers in age, as Pope

out our fire. Sterne.

Poets utter great and wise things which they
do not themselves understand. Plato.

Swiss. Fr. Pr.

Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, /

Carlyle.

Popular opinions, on subjects not palpable to
sense, are often true, but seldom or never
the whole truth. J. S. Mill.

Popularity is a blaze of illumination, or alas!
of conflagration, kindled round a man; showing

Positive happiness is constitutional and incapable

Poverty is not a shame, but the being ashamed                       20
of it is. Pr.

Poverty is often concealed in splendour, and
often in extravagance. It is the care of a
great part of mankind to conceal their indigence
from the rest. They support themselves
by temporary expedients, and everyday
is lost in contriving for to-morrow.
Johnson.

Poverty is the mither (mother) o' a' arts.
Sc. Pr.

the more loved ones there are to assist in
supporting it. Jean Paul.

bitterly satirical. H. Friswell.

Poverty of soul is irreparable. Montesquieu.

Poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and
virtue. It is hard for an empty bag to stand
upright. Ben. Franklin.

Poverty palls the most generous spirits; it
cows industry and casts resolution itself
into despair. Addison.

Poverty persuades a man to do and suffer
everything that he may escape from it.
Lucian.

Poverty should engender an honest pride, that                       30
it may not lead and tempt us to unworthy
actions. Dickens.

Poverty sits by the cradle of all our great
men, and rocks them up to manhood.
Heine.

Poverty snatches the reins out of the hands of
piety. Saadi.

Poverty takes away so many means of doing
good, and produces so much inability to
resist evil, both natural and moral, that
it is by all virtuous means to be avoided.
Johnson.

Poverty treads upon the heels of great and
unexpected riches. La Bruyère.

Poverty wants some, luxury many, and avarice                        35
all things. Cowley.

Power and permanence reside only in limitations.
Grabbe.

Power belongeth unto God. Bible.

Power cannot have too gentle an expression.
Jean Paul.

Power exercised with violence has seldom been
of long duration, but temper and moderation
generally produce permanence in all things.
Sen.

Power, in its quality and degree, is the                            40
measure of manhood. J. G. Holland.

Power is according to quality, not quantity.
How much more are men than nations?
Emerson.

Power is ever stealing from the many to the
few. Wendell Phillips.

Power is no blessing in itself, but when it is
employed to protect the innocent. Swift.

Power is nothing but as it is felt, and the delight
of superiority is proportionate to the
resistance overcome. Johnson.

Power is so characteristically calm, that calmness                  45
in itself has the aspect of strength.
Bulwer Lytton.

Power, like a desolating pestilence, / Pollutes
whate'er it touches; and obedience, / Bane
of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth, / Makes
slaves of men, and of the human frame a
mechanized automaton. Shelley.

Power, like the diamond, dazzles the beholder,
and also the wearer; it dignifies meanness;
it magnifies littleness; to what is contemptible,
it gives authority; to what is
low, exaltation. Colton.

Power to do good is the true and lawful end of
aspiring. Bacon.

Power will intoxicate the best hearts, as wine
the strongest heads. No man is wise enough,
no man good enough, to be trusted with unlimited
power. Colton.

Power's footstool is opinion, and his throne the                    50
human heart. Sir Aubrey de Vere.

Powerful attachment will give a man spirit
and confidence which he could by no means
call up or command of himself; and in this
mood he can do wonders which would not
be possible to him without it. Matthew
Arnold.

Practically men have come to imagine that the
laws of this universe, like the laws of constitutional
countries, are decided by voting;
that it is all a study of division-lists, and for
the universe too depends a little on the activity
of the whippers-in. Carlyle.

Practice aims at what is immediate; speculation
at what is remote. In practical life, the
wisest and soundest men avoid speculation,
and ensure success, because, by limiting
their range, they increase the tenacity
with which they grasp events, while in
speculative life the course is exactly the
reverse, since in that department the greater
the range the greater the command. Buckle.

Practice in time becomes second nature. Anon.

Practice is everything. Periander.

Praise a fool and you may make him useful.
Dan. Pr.

Praise a fool, and you water his folly. Pr.

Praise follows truth afar off, and only overtakes                   15
her at the grave. Plausibility clings
to her skirts and holds her back till then.
Lowell.

Praise from an enemy is the most pleasing of
all commendations. Steele.

Praise God more, and blame neighbours less.
Pr.

Praise is indeed the consequence and encouragement
of virtue; but it is sometimes so
unseasonably applied as to become its bane
and corruption too. Thomas à Kempis.

Praise is so pleasing to the mind of man that
it is the original motive of almost all our
actions. Johnson.

Praise is the tribute of men, but felicity the                      20
gift of God. Bacon.

Praise is virtue's shadow; who courts her doth
more the handmaid than the dame admire.
Heath.

Praise, like gold and diamonds, owes its value
only to its scarcity. Johnson.

Praise makes good men better, and bad men
worse. Pr.

Praise Peter, but don't find fault with Paul.

Prayer is a powerful thing; for God has bound
and tied himself thereto. Luther.

Prayer is a shield to the soul, a sacrifice to
God, and a scourge to Satan. Bunyan.

Prayer is a study of truth,--a sally of the soul
into the unfound infinite. Emerson.

Prayer is a turning of one's soul, in heroic
reverence, in infinite desire and endeavour,
towards the Highest, the All-excellent,
Supreme. Carlyle, in a letter to a young
friend.

Prayer is intended to increase the devotion of                      40
the individual, but if the individual himself
prays he requires no formulæ.... Real inward
devotion knows no prayer but that
arising from the depths of its own feelings.
W. v. Humboldt.

Prayer is the aspiration of our poor, struggling,
heavy-laden soul towards its Eternal
Father, and, with or without words, ought
not to become impossible, nor need it ever.

make there except that they may continue
loyal. Carlyle, in a letter to a young friend.

muscles of Omnipotence. Martin Tupper.

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, / Uttered                      45
or unexpressed, / The motion of a hidden
fire that trembles in the breast. J. Montgomery.

Prayer is the wing wherewith the soul flies to
heaven; and meditation the eye with which
we see God. St. Ambrose.

Prayer knocks till the door opens. Pr.

Prayer, like Jonathan's bow, returns not
empty. Gurnall.

Prayer moves the hand that moves the universe.
Anon.

Prayer must not come from the roof of the                           50
mouth, but from the root of the heart.
Pr.

Prayer purifies; it is a self-preached sermon.
Jean Paul.

Prayer should be the key of the day and the
lock of the night. Pr.

Prayer that craves a particular commodity,
anything less than all good, is vicious. As a
means to effect a private end, it is meanness
and theft. Emerson.

Prayers are but the body of the bird; desires
are its angel's wings. Jeremy Taylor.

Praying's the end of preaching. George Herbert.                   55

Preaching is the expression of the moral sentiment
in application to the duties of life.
Emerson.

grief but once, this for ever. Chilo.

Prejudice is a prophet which prophesies only
evil. Pr.

Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Hazlitt.

Prejudice squints when it looks, and lies when
it talks. Duchess d'Abrantes.

Prejudice, which he pretends to hate, is man's                      10
absolute lawgiver; mere use-and-wont everywhere
leads him by the nose: thus let but a
rising of the sun, let but a creation of the
world happen twice, and it ceases to be
marvellous, to be noteworthy or noticeable.
Carlyle.

Pride and grace ne'er dwell in ae place. Sc.
Pr.

Pride and poverty are ill met, yet often live

spirit before a fall. Bible.

Pride hath no other glass to show itself but
pride. Troil. and Cress., iii. 3.

Pride, ill-nature, and want of sense are the

the world. Swift.

Pride is a flower that grows in the devil's garden.
Howell.

Pride is lofty, calm, immovable; vanity is uncertain,
capricious, and unjust. Chamfort.

Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell, / Aspiring
to be angels, men rebel. Pope.

Chamfort.

Pride must suffer pain. Pr.

Pride never leaves its master till he gets a fa'.

Private credit is wealth; public honour is
security. The feather that adorns the royal

in it is no gentleman. Chapin.

Professional critics are incapable of distinguishing                50

laboratory has scales and weights, but

Proof of a God? A probable God! The smallest
of finites struggling to prove to itself ...
and include within itself, the Highest Infinite,
in which, by hypothesis, it lives and moves
and has its being! Man, reduced to wander
about, in stooping posture, with painfully-constructed
sulphur-match, and farthing
rushlight, or smoky tar-link, searching for

Property, O brother? Of my body I have but a
liferent.... But my soul, breathed into me

I call that mine and not thine. I will keep
that, and do what work I can with it; God
has given it me; the devil shall not take
it away. Carlyle.

Property there is among us valuable to the                          10
auctioneer; but the accumulated manufacturing,
commercial, economic skill which lies
impalpably warehoused in English hands
and heads, what auctioneer can estimate?
Carlyle.

heir surviving him, will at last eject him. Hor.

without having earned them--that is the aristocracy.

yields a rapid balm; / Live it down! Dr.
Henry Rink.

Railing and praising were his usual themes; /
And both, to show his judgment, in extremes; /
So over-violent or over-civil, / That every
man with him was god or devil. Dryden.

Raillery is a mode of speaking in favour of one's
wit against one's good nature. Montaigne.

Raillery is sometimes more insupportable than
wrong; because we have a right to resent injuries,
but it is ridiculous to be angry at a
jest. La Roche.

Railway travelling is not travelling at all; it is
merely being sent to a place, and very little
different from becoming a parcel. Ruskin.

Rainy days will surely come; / Take your                            45

Raise nae mair deils than ye're able to lay.

Rarity imparts a charm; thus early fruits and
winter roses are most prized; thus coyness

Fortuna--Common sense is generally rare in
that position of life, i.e., in high rank. Juv.

Rascals are always sociable, and the test of a
man's nobility is the small pleasure he has
in others' society. Schiller.

Rasch tritt der Tod den Menschen an, / Es ist                       15

mitten in der Bahn, / Es reisst ihn fort vom
vollen Leben. / Bereitet oder nicht; zu
gehen, / Er muss vor seinen Richter stehen--Death
of a sudden arrests his victim, man;
there is no respite given; he falls upon him in
midday, and tears him away when life is at the
full. Ready to go or not, he must stand before
his judge. Schiller.

read, / And Homer will be all the books you
need. Buckingham.

Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest. Book
of Common Prayer.

Read my little fable: / He that runs may read. /
Most can raise the flowers now, / For all
have got the seed. Tennyson.

Read not books alone, but men, and amongst
them chiefly thyself; if thou find anything
questionable there, use the commentary of a
severe friend rather than the gloss of a
sweet-lipped flatterer; there is more profit
in a distasteful truth than deceitful sweetness.
Quarles.

Read not to contradict and confute, nor to                          50
believe and take for granted, nor to find

Reader, if thou an oft-told tale wilt trust, /
Thou'lt gladly do and suffer what thou must.
Henry Marten.

Reading Chaucer is like brushing through the                         5
dewy grass at sunrise. Lowell.

Reading furnishes us only with the materials
of knowledge; it is thinking makes what
we read ours. Locke.

Reading for the sense (in Shakespeare's plays)
will best bring out the rhythm. Emerson.

Reading is thinking with another's head instead
of one's own. Schopenhauer.

Reading makes a full man, conference a ready
man, and writing an exact man. And therefore
if a man write little, he had need have a
great memory; if he confer little, have a
present wit; and if he read little, have much
cunning to seem to know that he doth not.
Bacon.

Reading without purpose is sauntering, not                          10
exercise. Bulwer Lytton.

greatest sorrow. Fénelon.

dearly we pay for its counterfeit! H. Ballou.

but in the use of facts, which makes a philosopher.
Buckle.

Real sorrow is almost as difficult to discover                      15
as real poverty. An instinctive delicacy
hides the rays of the one and the wounds of
the other. Mme. Swetchine.

Real ugliness in either sex means always some
kind of hardness of heart or vulgarity of
education. Ruskin.

Real worth floats not with people's fancies, no
more than a rock in the sea rises and falls
with the tide. Fuller.

Real worth requires no interpreter; its everyday
deeds form its blazonry. Chamfort.

Reality, if rightly interpreted, is grander than
fiction; nay, it is in the right interpretation
of reality and history that poetry consists.
Carlyle.

Reality is, no doubt, greater and more vital                        20
to know, in so real a world and life, than any
fiction; and the thoughts of God, which the
facts are, are infinitely more precious than
the fancies of men about them, or even
according to them; yet is man's power of
fancying, or fantasying, in harmony with
the fact, the measure of his knowledge of it
and vital relationship to it, and the divinely
appointed means withal whereby the fact
itself is brought home to our affections. Ed.

Reality surpasses imagination; and we see
breathing, brightening, and moving before
our eyes sights dearer to our hearts than
any we ever beheld in the land of dreams.
Goethe.

Reason and experience both forbid us to expect
that national morality can prevail in
exclusion of religious principle. Washington.

Reason can never be popular. Passions and
feelings may become popular; but reason
always remains the sole property of a few
eminent individuals. Goethe.

Reason can no more influence the will and
operate as a motive, than the eyes, which
show a man his road, can enable him to move
from place to place, or than a ship provided
with a compass can sail without a wind.
Whately.

Reason cannot show itself more reasonable                           25
than to cease reasoning on things above
reason. Sir P. Sidney.

Reason gains all men by compelling none.
Aaron Hill.

Reason has done, what it can do, when it discovers
and draws up the law; to execute this
law is reserved for him who feels the obligation
of it, and has the due firmness of purpose.
Schiller.

Reason has only to do with the becoming, the
living; but understanding with the become,
the already fixed, that it may make use of
it. Goethe.

Reason! how many eyes hast thou to see evils,
and how dim--nay, blind--thou art in preventing
them! Sir P. Sidney.

Reason is a bee, and exists only on what it                         30
makes; its usefulness takes the place of
beauty. Joubert.

Reason is a historian, but the passions are
the actors. Rivarol.

Reason is a very light rider, and easily shook
off. Swift.

Reason is directed to the process (das Werdende),
understanding to the product (das
Gewordene). The former is nowise concerned
about the whither, or the latter about the
whence. Goethe.

Reason is like the sun, of which the light is
constant, uniform, and lasting; fancy, a
meteor of bright but transitory lustre, irregular
in its motion and delusive in its direction.
Johnson.

Reason is progressive; instinct, stationary.                        35
Five thousand years have added no improvement
to the hive of the bee nor the
house of the beaver. Colton.

Reason is the life of the law; nay, the common
law itself is nothing else but reason. Coke.

Reason (Vernunft) is the only true despot.
Rahel.

Reason is the test of ridicule, not ridicule the
test of truth. Warburton.

Reason itself is true and just, but the reason
of every particular man is weak and wavering.
Swift.

Reason lies between bridle and spur. It. Pr.                      40

Reason, looking upwards, and carried to the
true above, realises a delight in wisdom,
unknown to the other parts of our nature.
Plato.

Reason raise o'er instinct as you can; / In this
'tis God directs, in that 'tis man. Pope.

Reason requires culture to expand it. It resembles
the fire concealed in the flint, which
only shows itself when struck with the steel.
Gordil.

Reason serves when pressed, but honest instinct
comes a volunteer. Pope.

Reason should direct, and appetite obey. Cic.

Reason teaches us to be silent; the heart
teaches us to speak. Jean Paul.

Reason's a staff for age when Nature's gone; /
But youth is strong enough to walk alone.
Dryden.

Reason's glimmering ray / Was lent, not to                           5
assure our doubtful way, / But guide us
upward to a better day. Dryden.

Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of sense, /
Lie in three words,--health, peace, and competence.
Pope.

Reasonable, or sensible, people are always the
best Conversation's Lexicon. Goethe.

Reasoning against a prejudice is like fighting
against a shadow; it exhausts the reasoner,
without visibly affecting the prejudice. Argument
cannot do the work of instruction any
more than blows can take the place of sunlight.
Mildmay.

Reasoning banishes reason. Molière.

Reasons are the pillars of the fabric of a sermon,                  10
but similitudes are the windows which
give the best light. Fuller.

Rebellentreue ist wankend--Fidelity among
rebels is unsteady. Schiller.

Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God. Inscription
on a cannon.

than of sugar. Pr.

Rebuke with soft words and hard arguments.

yourself spirited and resolute when perils press
you; likewise reef your sails when they swell too

Rebus in angustis facile est contemnere vitam; /
Fortiter ille facit qui miser esse potest--It is
easy in misfortune to despise life; but he does
bravely who can endure misery. Mart.

Rebus secundis etiam egregios duces insolescere--In
the hour of prosperity even the best
generals are apt to be haughty and insolent.

Recommending secrecy where a dozen of
people are acquainted with the circumstance
to be concealed, is only putting the
truth in masquerade, for the story will be
circulated under twenty different shapes.
Scott.

Recompense injury with justice, and recompense
kindness with kindness. Confucius.

Recompense to no man evil for evil. St. Paul.

Recta actio non erit, nisi recta fuit voluntas,
ab hac enim est actio. Rursus, voluntas
non erit recta, nisi habitus animi rectus
fuerit, ab hoc enim est voluntas--An action
will not be right unless the intention is right, for
from it comes the action. Again, the intention
will not be right unless the state of the mind has
been right, for from it proceeds the intention. Sen.

Recte et suaviter--Uprightly and mildly. M.                       35

Rectius vives, Licini, neque altum / Semper

Signat humum, gestit paribus colludere, et
iram / Colligit ac ponit temere, et mutatur
in horas--The boy who just knows how to talk
and treads the ground with firm foot, delights
to play with his mates, is easily provoked and
easily appeased, and changes every hour. Hor.

delicate wings. Amiel.

Reform is affirmative, conservatism negative;                        5
conservatism goes for comfort, reform for
truth. Emerson.

Reform is not joyous but grievous; no single
man can reform himself without stern suffering
and stern working; how much less can
a nation of men. Carlyle.

Reform, like charity, must begin at home.
Once well at home, how will it radiate outwards,
irrepressible, into all that we touch
and handle, speak and work; kindling ever
new light by incalculable contagion; spreading,
in geometric ratio, far and wide; doing
good only, wherever it spreads, and not evil.
Carlyle.

Reformers (Reformatorische Geister) do not step
into the arena amid a flourish of drums and
trumpets; they must make their debut rather
under the badge of the cross, and have been
cradled at their birth in a manger; poverty
and a humble pedigree is all their inheritance,
and their childhood is never touched
or shone upon by the glitter (Glanze) of the
world. K. Fischer.

Reforms are generally most unpopular where
most needed. Martin.

is a right kingly act, believe me, to succour

give to the rich, we take from the poor. Ger. Pr.

Reine d'un jour--Queen for a day. Fr.

Reipublicæ forma laudari facilius quam evenire,
et si evenit, haud diuturna esse potest--It is
more easy to praise a republican form of government

it cannot be of long duration. Tac.

Reisst den Menschen aus seinen Verhältnissen;
und was er dann ist, nur das ist er--Tear
man out of his outward circumstances; and
what he then is, that only is he. Seume.

Rejecting the miracles of Christ, we still have
the miracle of Christ himself. Bovee.

Rejoice in joyous things--nor overmuch / Let                        25
grief thy bosom touch / Midst evil, and still
bear in mind / How changeful are the ways
of humankind. Archilochus.

Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let
thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy
youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart,
and in the sight of thine eyes; but know
thou that for all these things God will bring
thee into judgment. Bible.

Rejoice that you have still long to live before
the thought comes to you that there is

evil without the grace of God. Haydon.

Religion and morality, as they now stand,                           35
compose a practical code of misery and servitude....
How would morality, dressed up
in stiff stays and finery, start from her own
disgusting image, should she look into the
mirror of Nature! Shelley.

Religion bids man prefer the endurance of a
lesser evil before a greater, and nature
itself does no less. South.

Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires, /
And unawares morality expires. Pope.

Religion cannot change, though we do. Jeremy
Taylor.

Religion cannot rise above the state of the
votary. Heaven always bears some proportion
to earth. Emerson.

Religion contains infinite sadness. If we are                       40
to love God, he must be in distress (lit., in
need of help). Novalis. See Matt., xxvii. 46.

Religion des Kreuzes, nur du verknüpfest, in
einem / Kranze der Demut und Kraft doppelte
Palme zugleich--Religion of the Cross!
only thou unitest in one wreath together the twofold
palm of humility and power. Platen.

Religion gives part of its reward in hand, the
present comfort of having done our duty;
and for the rest, it offers us the best security
that heaven can give. Tillotson.

Religion, if in heavenly truths attired, / Needs
only to be seen to be admired. Cowper.

Religion, if it be true, is central truth; and all
knowledge which is not gathered round it,
and quickened and illuminated by it, is hardly
worth the name. Channing.

Religion is a fire which example keeps alive,

Joubert.

Religion is again here, for whoever will piously
struggle upward, and sacredly, sorrowfully
refuse to speak lies, which indeed will mostly
mean refuse to speak at all on that topic.
Carlyle.

Religion is an everlasting lodestar, that beams                      5
the brighter in the heavens the darker here
on earth grows the night. Carlyle.

Religion is as necessary to reason as reason
to religion. Washington.

Religion is life, philosophy is thought.... We
need both thought and life, and we need that
the two shall be in harmony. J. F. Clarke.

Religion is neither a theology nor a theosophy,
but a discipline, a law, a yoke, an indissoluble
engagement. Joubert.

Religion is not a dogma nor an emotion, but
a service. R. D. Hitchcock.

Religion is the spice which is meant to keep
life from corruption. Bacon.

Religion is universal, theology is exclusive;
religion is humanitarian, theology is sectarian;
religion unites mankind, theology
divides it; religion is love--broad and all-comprising
as God's love, theology preaches
love and practises bigotry; religion looks
to the moral worth of man, theology to his
creed and denomination. M. Lilienthal.

Religion lies more in walk than in talk.
Pr.

Religion, like its votaries, while it exists on
earth, must have a body as well as a soul.

Emerson.

see that, against all appearances, the nature
of things works for truth and right for ever.

Religion, poetry, is not dead; it will never die.
Its dwelling and birthplace is in the soul of
man, and it is eternal as the being of man.
In any point of space, in any section of time,
let there be a living man; and there is an
infinitude above him and beneath him, and
an eternity encompasses him on this hand
and on that; and tones of sphere-music and
tidings from loftier worlds will flit round him,
if he can but listen, and visit him with holy
influences, even in the thickest press of trivialities
or the din of busiest life. Carlyle.

Religion presents few difficulties to the humble,
many to the proud, innumerable ones to the
vain. Hare.

Religion should be the rule of life, not a casual
incident in it. Disraeli.

Religion without morality is a superstition and
a curse; and anything like an adequate and
complete morality without religion is impossible.

make a whole man. Religion would save a
man; Christ would make him worth saving.
Ward Beecher.

Religionen sind Kinder der Unwissenheit, die
ihre Mutter nicht lange überleben--Religions
are the children of ignorance, and they do not
long outlive their mother. Schopenhauer.

Religions are not proved, are not established,                      35
are not overthrown, by logic. They are, of
all the mysteries of nature and the human
mind, the most mysterious and inexplicable;
they are of instinct, and not of reason. Lamartine.

Religious contention is the devil's harvest.
La Fontaine.

Religious zeal leads to cleanliness, cleanliness
to purity, purity to godliness, godliness to
humility, humility to the fear of sin. Rabbi

Rem, facias rem, / Si possis recte, si non, quocunque
modo rem--A fortune, make a fortune,
honestly if you can; if not, make it by any
means. Hor.

Rem tu strenuus auge--Labour assiduously to                         40
increase your property. Hor.

"Remain content in the station in which Providence
has placed you," is on the whole a
good maxim, but it is peculiarly for home
use. That your neighbour should, or should
not, remain content with his position is not
your business; but it is very much your
business to remain content with your own.
Ruskin.

Remark how many are better off than you are;
consider how many are worse. Sen.

Remember Atlas was weary. Fuller.

Remember now thy creator in the days of thy
youth. Bible.

the same time, as polished as your sword.
Sheridan.

Remember that all tricks are either knavish or
childish. Johnson.

Remember that the time once yours can never
be so again. Thomas à Kempis.

Remember that with every breath we draw, an
ethereal stream of Lethe runs through our
whole being, so that we have but a partial
recollection of our joys, and scarcely any of
our sorrows. Goethe.

Remember that you are an actor in a drama                            5
of such sort as the Author chooses. If
short, then in a short one; if long, then in a
long one. If it be His pleasure that you
should act a poor man, see that you act it
well; or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private
citizen. For this is your business, to act
well the given part; but to choose it, belongs
to another. Epictetus.

Remember this: that your conscience is not a
law--no; God and reason made the law, and
has placed conscience within you to determine.
Sterne.

Remember thy prerogative is to govern, and
not to serve, the things of this world. Thomas
à Kempis.

Remember your failures are the seed of your
most glorious successes. Despond if you
must, but don't despair. Anon.

Remembrance and reflection how allied! / What
thin partitions sense from thought divide!
Pope.

Remembrance (Erinnerung) is the only Paradise                   10
from which we cannot be driven. Jean
Paul.

Remembrance makes the poet; 'tis the past, /
Lingering within him with a keener sense /
Than is upon the thoughts of common men, /
Of what has been, that fills the actual world /
With unreal likenesses of lovely shapes, /
That were and are not. L. E. Landon.

Remembrance wakes with all her busy train, /
Swells at my breast, and turns the past to
pain. Goldsmith.

Remis velisque--With oars and sails; with tooth
and nail. Pr.

Remis ventisque--With oars and wind.

Remorse is as the heart in which it grows: /                        15
If that be gentle, it drops balmy dews / Of
true repentance; but if proud and gloomy, /
It is the poison tree that, pierced to the inmost,
/ Weeps only tears of poison. Coleridge.

Remorse is the echo of a lost virtue. Bulwer
Lytton.

Remorse, the fatal egg by pleasure laid.
Cowper.

Remote from man, with God he passed his

hoarsely our whole life long. Goethe in
"Faust."

Renovate animos--Renew your courage. M.                           25

Renown is not to be sought, and all pursuit of
it is vain. A person may, indeed, by skilful
conduct and various artificial means, make
a sort of name for himself; but if the inner
jewel is wanting, all is vanity, and will not
last a day. Goethe.

Rente viagère--An annuity. Fr.

Rentes--Funds bearing interest; stocks. Fr.

Rentier--A fund-holder. Fr.

Repartee is perfect when it effects its purpose                     30
with a double edge. It is the highest order
of wit, as it bespeaks the coolest yet quickest
exercise of genius, at a moment when the
passions are roused. Colton.

Repentance clothes in grass and flowers the
grave in which the past is laid. J. Sterling.

Repentance costs very dear. Pr.

Repentance hath a purifying power, and every
tear is of a cleansing virtue; but these penitential
clouds must be still kept dropping;

is not one single action, but a course. South.

Repentance is accepted remorse. Mme. Swetchine.

Repentance is good, but innocence is better. Pr.                  35

Repose and cheerfulness are the badge of the
gentleman--repose in energy. The Greek
battle-pieces are calm; the heroes, in whatever
violent actions engaged, retain a serene
aspect. Emerson.

Repose and happiness is what thou covetest,
but these are only to be obtained by labour.
Thomas à Kempis.

Repose is as necessary in conversation as in a
picture. Hazlitt.

Repose is the cradle of power. J. G. Holland.

Repose without stagnation is the state most                         50
favourable to happiness. "The great felicity
of life," says Seneca, "is to be without perturbation."
Bovee.

Reproof never does a wise man harm. Pr.

Reproof on her lips, but a smile in her eye.
S. Lover.

Reprove thy friend privately; commend him
publicly. Solon.

Republics end with luxury; monarchies, with
poverty. Montesquieu.

Reputation is an idle and false imposition, oft                      5
got without merit, and lost without deserving;
you have lost no reputation at all unless
you repute yourself such a loser. Othello, ii. 3.

Reputation is commonly measured by the acre.
Pr.

Reputation is in itself only a farthing candle,
of a wavering and uncertain flame, and easily
blown out, but it is the light by which the
world looks for and finds merit. Lowell.

Reputation is rarely proportioned to virtue.
St. Evermond.

Reputation is what men and women think of
us. Character is what God and angels know
of us. Thomas Paine.

Reputation, reputation, reputation! O I have                        10
lost my reputation. I have lost the immortal
part of myself, and what remains is bestial.
Othello, ii. 3.

injury, and pains him unjustly who did not
intend it. Johnson.

Resentment, indeed, may remain, perhaps                             30
cannot be quite extinguished in the noblest

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. St.
James.

Resistance ought never to be thought of but
when an utter subversion of the laws of the
realm threatens the whole frame of our constitution,
and no redress can otherwise be
hoped for. It therefore does, and ought for
ever, to stand in the eye and letter of the
law as the highest offence. Walpole.

Resolution is independent of great age, but
without it one lives a hundred years in vain.
Chinese Pr.

Revelation may not need the help of reason,

brings the necessary flame. Simms.

mind. Joubert.

Revenge of a wrong only makes another

Rhetoric is nothing but reason well dressed

enemy of enthusiasm, and properly the only
antagonist that can be opposed to it with
success. Goldsmith.

Ridicule intrinsically is a small faculty; we
may say, the smallest of all faculties that
other men are at the pains to repay with

thought, to knowledge, properly so called;
its nourishment and essence is denial, which
hovers on the surface, while knowledge
dwells far below. Carlyle.

Ridicule is a weak weapon when levelled at a                        40

what is it but the sour fruit of a most blessed
increase, that of knowledge; a fruit, too,
that will not always continue sour. (?)

gifts; but it is really ultra vires there. It is
blindness laying down the laws of optics.
Carlyle.

Schadet ein Irrtum wohl? Nicht immer!

Der dem Weltgeschick nicht feig entwichen, /
Zieht er aus dem Busen sich den Pfeil, / Ist
er für die Welt und Gott verblichen--Pain
and love are the portion of the man who does
not like a coward shirk the world's destiny; if he
plucks the arrow from his breast, he becomes as
one dead for the world and God. N. Lenau.

Scholars are frequently to be met with who

It conceals not merely secrets, but
blemishes. Zachariä.

Schweigen können zeugt von Kraft, schweigen
wollen von Nachsicht, schweigen müssen
vom Geist der Zeit--To be able to be silent
testifies of power, to will to be silent of indulgence,
to be obliged to be silent of the spirit
of the time. C. J. Weber.

Schwer ist es, aus dem Geschrei erhitzter
Parteien die Stimme der Wahrheit zu unterscheiden--It
is difficult to discriminate the voice
of truth from amid the clamour raised by heated
partisans. Schiller.

Science is a first-rate piece of furniture for a

As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit, /
That could be moved to smile at anything.
Jul. Cæs., i. 2.

Seldom, in the business and transactions of
ordinary life, do we find the sympathy we
want. Goethe.

Seldom is a life wholly wrecked but the cause                       35
lies in some internal mal-arrangement, some
want less of good fortune than of good
guidance. Carlyle.

power. / Yet not for power (power of herself

by law, / Acting the law we live by without
fear; / And, because right is right, to follow
right, / Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.

the fancy. Lowell.

Sentiment is the ripened fruit of fantasy.

Sentimental literature, concerned with the

Sentimentalism is that state in which a man                          5

they are beautiful, and touching and fine to
say them--things that he fain would feel, and
fancies that he does feel. F. W. Robertson.

Serpentum major concordia; parcit / Cognatis

Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, /

Shakespeare carries us to such a lofty strain
of intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth
that beggars his own; and we then feel that
the splendid works which he has created,
and which in other hours we extol as a sort
of self-existent poetry, have no stronger
hold of real nature than the shadow of a
passing traveller on the rock. Emerson.

Shakespeare does not look at a thing merely,
but into it, through it, so that he constructively
comprehends it, can take it asunder
and put it together again; the thing melts,
as it were, into light under his eye, and
anew creates itself before him. Carlyle.

Shakespeare is dangerous to young poets;
they cannot but reproduce him, while they
imagine they are producing themselves.
Goethe.

Shakespeare is no sectarian; to all he deals                        10
with equity and mercy; because he knows
all, and his heart is wide enough for all. In
his mind the world is a whole; he figures it
as Providence governs it; and to him it is
not strange that the sun should be caused to
shine on the evil and the good, and the rain
to fall on the just and the unjust. Carlyle.

Shakespeare is the greatest intellect who, in
our recorded world, has left record of himself
in the way of literature. I know not
such power of vision, such faculty of thought
in any other man, such calmness of depth;
placid joyous strength; all things imaged in
that great soul of his so true and clear, as
in a tranquil unfathomable sea. A perfectly
level mirror, that is to say withal, a
man justly related to all things and men, a
good man. Carlyle.

Shakespeare made his Hamlet as a bird weaves
its nest. Emerson.

Shakespeare must have seemed a dull man at
times, he was so flashingly brilliant at others.
Bovee.

Shakespeare never permits a spirit to show
itself but to men of the highest intellectual
power. Ruskin.

Shakespeare says we are creatures that look                         15
before and after; the more surprising that
we do not look round a little and see what is
passing under our very eyes. Carlyle.

Shakespeare stands alone. His want of erudition
was a most happy and productive
ignorance; it forced him back upon his
own resources, which were exhaustless.
Colton.

Shakespeare, the finest human figure, as I apprehend,
that Nature has hitherto seen fit
to make out of our widely-diffused Teutonic
clay. I find no human soul so beautiful, these
fifteen hundred known years--our supreme
modern European man. Carlyle.

Shakespeare, the sage and seer of the human
heart. H. Giles.

Shakespeare was forbidden of heaven to have
any plans.... Not for him the founding of
institutions, the preaching of doctrines, or
the repression of abuses. Neither he, nor
the sun, did on any morning that they rose
together, receive charge from their Maker
concerning such things. They were both of
them to shine on the evil and good; both to
behold unoffendingly all that was upon the
earth, to burn unappalled upon the spears of
kings, and undisdaining upon the reeds of
the river. Ruskin.

Shakespeare (it is true) wrote perfect historical                 20
plays on subjects belonging to the preceding
centuries, (but) they are perfect plays just
because there is no care about centuries in
them, but a life which all men recognise for
the human life of all time; ... a rogue in
the fifteenth century being, at heart, what a
rogue is in the nineteenth and was in the
twelfth; and an honest or a knightly man
being, in like manner, very similar to other
such at any other time. Ruskin.

Shall horses run upon the rock? Will one
plough there with oxen? Bible.

Shall we receive good at the hands of the
Lord, and shall we not receive evil? Bible.

Shall we repine at a little misplaced charity,
when an all-knowing, all-wise Being showers
down every day his benefits on the unthankful

Shall workmen just repeat the sin of kings and
conquerors? / As the nations cease from
battle, shall the classes rouse the fray, / And

"Shalls" and "wills." Never trust a Scotch

Shame is worse than death. Russ. Pr.

Shame may restrain what law does not prohibit.

Shapes that come not at an earthly call / Will

Sharpness cuts slight things best; solid, nothing                   35

She (i.e., Nature) only knows / How justly to

She should be humble who would please, /

She wept to feel her life so desolate, / And
wept still more because the world had made
it / So desolate: yet was the world her all; /
She loathed it, but she knew it was her all.
Dr. Walter Smith.

She who makes her husband and her children
happy, who reclaims the one from vice, and
trains up the other to virtue, is a much
greater character than ladies described in
romance, whose whole occupation is to
murder mankind with shafts from their
quiver or their eyes. Goldsmith.

She's all my fancy painted her; / She's lovely,

She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd; /
She's a woman, and therefore to be won.

Show me the man you honour; I know by

which men silently gazed on with
wonder and tears. Carlyle.

steal the lamb. 2 Henry VI., iii. 1.

Snatch from the ashes of your sires / The                           45

the strife expires / Will add to theirs a name
of fear / That tyranny shall quake to hear, /
And leave his sons a hope, a fame, / They
too would rather die than shame. Byron.

So behave that the odour of your actions may

day; / Think wilt thou let it / Slip useless
away. / Out of Eternity / This new day is
born; / Into Eternity / At night doth return.

did: / So soon it for ever / From all eyes is
hid. / Here hath been dawning, &c. Carlyle
on To-day.

So I do my part to others, let them think of
me what they will or can.... If I should
regard such things, it were in another's
power to defeat my charity, and evil should
be stronger than good. But difficulties are
so far from cooling Christians that they
whet them. George Herbert.

So lang man lebt, sei man lebendig--So long                          5
as you live, be living. Goethe.

to God, as if men heard you. Sen.

seeméd there to be. Coleridge.

So long as a man is capable of self-renewal he
is a living being. Amiel.

departed, and the Actual owns to no soul of
truth any longer. Carlyle.

So long as the "Holy Place" in their souls                          10

So much in the world depends upon getting
what we want. Prosperity is to the human
heart like a sunny south wall to a peach.
Holme Lee.

So much of our time is preparation, so much
is routine, and so much retrospect, that the
pith of each man's genius contracts itself to
a very few hours. Emerson.

So much to do, / So little done, such things to
be. Tennyson.

So nigh is grandeur to our dust, / So near is
God to man, / When Duty whispers low,

Zeit / Und wirke der Gottheit lebendiges
Kleid--'Tis thus at the roaring loom of Time
I ply, / And weave for God the garment thou seest
him by (lit. the living garment of the Deity).
Goethe.

So soon as one's heart is tender it is weak.
When it is beating so warmly against the
breast, and the throat is, as it were, tied
tightly, and one strives to press the tears
from one's eyes and feels an incomprehensible
joy as they begin to flow, then we are
so weak that we are fettered by chains of
flowers, not because they have become strong
through any magic chain, but because we
tremble lest we should tear them asunder.
Goethe.

So soon as people try honestly to see all they
can of anything, they come to a point where
a noble dimness begins. They see more
than others; but the consequence of their
seeing more is, that they feel they cannot
see at all; and the more intense their perception,
the more the crowd of things which
they partly see will multiply upon them.
Ruskin.

So soon as sacrifice becomes a duty and
necessity to man, I see no limit to the horizon
which opens before him. Renan.

So spiritual (geistig) is our whole daily life; all
that we do springs out of mystery, spirit,
invisible force; only like a little cloud-image,
or Armida's palace, air-built, does the actual
body itself forth from the great mystic deep.
Carlyle.

So stirbt ein Held, anbetungsvoll--So dies a                        25
hero to be worshipped. Schiller.

So study evermore is overshot; / While it doth
study to have what it would, / It doth forget
to do the thing it should; / And when it hath
the thing it hunteth most, / 'Tis won as towns
with fire,--so won, so lost. Love's L. Lost,
i. 1.

So sweetly she bade me adieu, / I thought that
she bade me return. Shenstone.

So teach us to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom. Bible.

purpose, but do not thou serve it. Goethe.

So thou be good, slander doth but approve /                         30
Thy worth the greater. Shakespeare.

So to living or dead let the solemn bell call; /
Sleeping or waking, time passes with all.
Dr. Walter Smith.

So turns the faithful needle to the pole, /
Though mountains rise between and oceans
roll. Darwin.

So we grew together, / Like to a double
cherry, seeming parted, / But yet a union in
partition; / Two lovely berries moulded on
one stem. / So with two seeming bodies, but
one heart. Mid. N.'s. Dream, iii. 2.

So wise, so young, they say, do ne'er live
long. Rich. III., iii. 1.

So wonderful is human nature, and its varied                        35
ties / Are so involved and complicate, that
none / May hope to keep his inward spirit
pure, / And walk without perplexity through
life. Goethe.

So work the honey bees; / Creatures that, by
a rule in Nature, teach / The art of order to
a peopled kingdom. Henry V., i. 2.

Fuller.

Sobald du dir vertraust, sobald weisst du zu
leben--So soon as you feel confidence in yourself,
you know the art of life. Goethe, Mephisto in

Society everywhere is in conspiracy against
the manhood of every one of its members.

an artist:--by its sympathy with his meanest
powers; secondly, by its chilling want of

thoughts. Ruskin.

figure two authentic revelations, of a God
and of a devil. Carlyle.

Society has only one law, and that is custom.
Hamerton.

Society is a long series of uprising ridges,                        15

valley of repose. Wherever you take your
stand, you are looked down upon by those
above you, and reviled and pelted by those
below you. Bulwer Lytton.

Society is a masked ball, where every one
hides his real character, and reveals it by
hiding. Emerson.

he is dragged down by the mass, either by
ridicule or calumny. Victor Hugo.

heads among them take the best places.
Emerson.

Society is a wave. The wave moves onward,

dinners. Chamfort.

serious disasters forthwith ensuing. Draper.

Society is founded upon cloth. Carlyle.                           25

summon others to serve them. They contrive
everywhere to exhaust for their single
comfort the entire means and appliances of
that luxury to which our invention has yet
attained. Emerson.

and frivolous persons, who prey upon the
rest, and whom no public opinion concentrated
into good manners, forms accepted by
the sense of all, can reach. Emerson.

to the speaker his words, groan for groan,
song for song. Dr. David Thomas.

necessarily imbibe from it something which
is either infectious or hurtful.  Bp. Hall.

Society is the grandmother of humanity through
her daughters the inventions. C. J. Weber.

Society is the standing wonder of our existence;
a true region of the supernatural;
as it were, a second all-embracing life,
wherein our first individual life becomes
doubly and trebly alive, and whatever of
infinitude was in us bodes itself forth, and
becomes visible and active. Carlyle.

Society is well governed when the people obey
the magistrates, and the magistrates the
laws. Solon.

Society lives by faith, and develops by science.                    35
Amiel.

Society rests upon conscience, not upon
science. Amiel.

Society will pardon much to genius and special
gifts; but, being in its nature conventional,
it loves what is conventional. Emerson.

Society wishes to be amused. I do not wish
to be amused. I wish that life should not be
cheap, but sacred; the days to be as centuries,
loaded, fragrant. Emerson.

Socius fidelis anchora tuta est--A faithful companion
is a sure anchor. M.

Socrates quidem quum rogaretur cujatem se                           40
esse diceret, Mundanum, inquit. Totius
enim mundi se incolam et civem arbitrabatur--When

he professed to be a citizen, he answered, "Of
the world;" for he considered himself an inhabitant
and citizen of the whole world. Cic.

Soldiers in peace are like chimneys in summer.
Lord Burleigh.

Soldiers (there are) of the ploughshare as well                   10
as of the sword. Ruskin.

Soldiers! what I have to offer you is fatigue,
danger, struggle, and death; the chill of the
cold night in the free air, and heat under
the burning sun; no lodgings, no munitions,
no provisions, but forced marches, dangerous
watchposts, and the continual struggle with
the bayonet against batteries. Those who
love freedom and their country may follow
me! Garibaldi to his Roman soldiers. (That
is the most glorious speech I ever heard in my
life. Kossuth.)

"Solem præ jaculorum multitudine et sagittarum
non videbis." "In umbra igitur pugnabimus"--"You

it, no counsel (Rath) helps us; wisdom is
always too early or too late. Rückert.

vanity. Cowley.

Solitude cherishes great virtues and destroys
little ones. Sydney Smith.

Solitude dulls the thought, too much company                        20

the best theatre; the institution is best
there, but the practice here; the wilderness

society opportunities of perfection. Jeremy

Solitude is as needful to the imagination as
society is wholesome for the character.
Lowell.

Solitude is impracticable, and society fatal.
Emerson.

the wicked, and the joy of the good. (?)

Solitude is the home of the strong; silence,
their prayer. Ravignan.

Solitude sometimes is best society, / And short
retirement urges sweet return. Milton.

Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity, is to
genius the stern friend, the cold, obscure
shelter where moult the wings that will
bear it farther than suns and stars. He
who would inspire and lead his race must
be defended from travelling with the souls
of other men, from living, breathing, reading,
and writing in the daily time-worn yoke
of their opinions. Emerson.

Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant--They                          30

rush upon the sword; some push their way into
courts and the portals of kings. Virg.

is planted in the soil goes with it. L.

great soul's wealth lies in heaps, like a

part of future edifices; some are quarries
from which stones are to be split for shaping
and after use. Holmes.

Some books are lees frae end to end, / And
some big lees were never penn'd; / E'en
ministers they hae been kenn'd, / In holy
rapture, / A rousing whid at times to vend, /
And nail't wi' Scripture. Burns.

Some books are to be tasted, others to be
swallowed, and some few to be chewed and

because they're dry. Saying.

Some evils are cured by contempt. Pr.

Some falls are means the happier to rise.

inside. George Eliot.

which of the two gives us most trouble.

Some of the most famous books are least                             30

be done. The work done, the virtue of the
book expires. John Morley.

sharpest you still have survived; / But what
torments of pain you endured / From evils
that never arrived! Emerson, from the
French.

time of their youth, would almost persuade
us that there were no fools in those days;
but unluckily they are left themselves for
examples. Pope.

Some people are all quality; you would think
they were made up of nothing but title and

transports them to such a degree of haughtiness
that they reckon it below themselves to
exercise either good-nature or good manners.
L'Estrange.

Some people are so fond of ill-luck that they
run half way to meet it. D. Jerrold.

Some people carry their hearts in their heads;                      35

their God, are content to make a god of their
religion. Helps.

impertinence, or wish you good morning.
Hare.

Some philosophers seek to exalt man by display

by pointing to his miseries. Pascal.

Some prayers, indeed, have a longer voyage
than others, but then they return with richer
lading at last. Gurnall.

Some read books only with a view to find fault,
while others read only to be taught; the
former are like venomous spiders, extracting

Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall; /                        45

place, gentle words. These things are never

get from them somewhat to remember;
others lay criticism asleep by a charm.
Emerson.

Some tears belong to us because we are unfortunate;
others, because we are humane;
many, because we are mortal. But most are
caused by our being unwise. It is these last
only that of necessity produce more. Leigh
Hunt.

Some that speak no ill of any do no good to                          5
any. Pr.

have but a shadow's bliss. Mer. of Venice,
ii. 9.

Some to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse, /

use. Pope.

as an ill-stored harvest with untimely rain;
and some gold is brighter in sunshine than
in substance. Ruskin.

Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen /
That led calm Henry. 3 Hen. VI., ii. 6.

Some village Hampden, that with dauntless                           10
breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood, /
Some mute inglorious Milton here
may rest, / Some Cromwell guiltless of his
country's blood. Gray.

some in prosperity. Addison.

Some wee short hours ayont the twal. Burns.

Some work in the morning may trimly be
done, / That all the day after may hardly be

human justice, / As God surpasseth man.
Schelling.

Spirit-power begins in directing animal power

an arrow from a cross-bow, which has equal
force though shot by a child. Johnson.

kann ich nützen; / Zeigt mir der Freund,
was ich kann, lehrt mich der Feind, was ich
soll--Dear is to me the friend, yet can I make
even my very foe do me a friend's part. My
friend shows me what I can do; my foe teaches
me what I should do. Schiller.

blushes to beg a blessing, or, having succeeded,
dares not present a thanksgiving.

come. Macb., i. 7.

eschewed, and even hated. Carlyle.

sells an ounce of credit. Lord Burleigh.

That golden key that opes the palace of eternity.
Milton.

That government is the best which makes
government unnecessary. W. von Humboldt.

That great mystery of time, were there no
other; the illimitable, silent never-resting
thing called "time," rolling, rushing on,
swift, silent like an all-embracing oceantide,
on which we and all the universe swim
like exhalations, like apparitions which are
and then are not--this is for ever very literally
a miracle, a thing to strike us dumb;
for we have no word to speak about it.
Carlyle.

That grief is light which is capable of counsel.
Pr.

That he is mad 'tis true; 'tis true, 'tis pity; /                   15

That is gold that is worth gold. Pr.

That is indeed a twofold knowledge which
profits alike by the folly of the foolish and
the wisdom of the wise. It is both a shield
and a sword; it borrows its security from
the darkness, and its confidence from the
light. Colton.

sages. Hitopadesa.

which bids us "meddle not." Colton.

That is the true light which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world. St. John.

end. Young.

of something which he cannot know to
the full, which he is always going on to know.

entereth into any action, the failing wherein
may disgrace him more than the carrying of
it through can honour him. Bacon.

to practice. Hitopadesa.

That man is little to be envied whose patriotism
would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon,

That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man, /
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

capacity for knowledge, this I call tragedy.
Carlyle.

That philanthropy has surely a flaw in it which                      5
cannot sympathise with the oppressor equally
as with the oppressed. Lowell.

That rich man is great who thinketh not himself
great because he is rich; the proud man
(who is the poor man) braggeth outwardly
but beggeth inwardly; he is blown up, but
not full. S. Hieron.

That single effort by which we stop short in
the down-hill path to perdition is of itself a
greater exertion of virtue than a hundred
acts of justice. Goldsmith.

That souls which are created for one another

the majority triumphs and unintelligence
(Unverstand) decides. Schiller.

That that is, is. As You Like It, iv. 2.

That the voice of the common people is the voice                    15
of God, is as full of falsehood as commonness.
For who sees not that those black-mouthed
hounds, upon the mere scent of opinion, as
freely spend their mouths in hunting counter,
or, like Actæon's dogs, in chasing an innocent
man to death, as if they followed the chase
of truth itself, in a fresh scent? A. Warwick.

That thee is sent receive in buxomness: / The
wrestling of this world asketh a fall. / Here
is no home, here is but wilderness. / Forth,
pilgrim, forth--on, best out of thy stall. /
Look up on high, and thank the God of all.
Chaucer.

That thought I regard as true which is fruitful
to myself, which is connected with the rest
of my thoughts, and at the same time helps
me on. Now it is not only possible, but
natural, that such a thought should not connect
itself with the mind of another, nor
help him on ... consequently he will regard
it as false. Once we are thoroughly convinced
of this, we shall never enter upon
controversies. Goethe.

That ugly treason of mistrust. Mer. of Ven., iii. 2.

That unity which has not its origin in the
multitude is tyranny. Pascal.

That very law which moulds a tear, / And bids                       20
it trickle from its source; / That law preserves
the earth a sphere, / And guides the
planets in their course. Rogers.

That vice has often proved an emancipator of
the mind is one of the most humiliating, but
also one of the most unquestionable, facts in
history. Lecky.

is scarcely worth the sentinel. Goldsmith.

That voluntary debility, which modern language
is content to term indolence, will, if it
is not counteracted by resolution, render in

the flame to the smoke of virtue. Johnson.

That warrior on his strong war-horse, fire
flashes through his eyes; force dwells in his
arm and heart; but warrior and war-horse
are a vision; a revealed force, nothing more.
Stately they tread the earth, as if it were
firm substance. Fool! the earth is but a
film; it cracks in twain, and warrior and
war-horse sink beyond plummet's sounding.
Carlyle.

That we devote ourselves to God is seen / In                        25
living just as though no God there were.
Browning.

That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time /
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
Julius Cæsar, iii. 1.

That we should find our national existence
depend on selling manufactured cotton at a
farthing an ell cheaper than any other people,
is a most narrow stand for a great nation to
base itself on. Carlyle.

That we would do, / We should do when we
would; for this "would" changes, / And hath
abatements and delays as many / As there
are tongues, are hands, are accidents; / And
then this "should" is like a spendthrift's
sigh, / That hurts by easing. Ham., iv. 7.

comprehended all at once; the last point of
which could be seen by one just entering its
precincts. Goethe.

wilt come to. The Koran.

With me I bring the one thing needful--love.
Goethe.

That which in mean men we entitle patience, /
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
Rich. II., i. 2.

That which, intellectually considered, we call
Reason, considered in relation to nature we
call Spirit. Emerson.

That which is crooked cannot be made
straight: and that which is wanting cannot
be numbered. Bible.

That which is good to take is good to keep. Pr.

That which is in the midst of fools is made                         40
known. Bible.

That which is not allotted the hand cannot
reach, and what is allotted will find you
wherever you may be. Saadi.

That which is past is gone and irrevocable,
and wise men have enough to do with things
present and to come; therefore they do but
trifle with themselves that labour in past
matters. Bacon.

That which is possible is ever possible. Hitopadesa.

That which is truly and indeed characteristic
of the man is known only to God. Ruskin.

That which makes men happy is activity (die
Thätigkeit), which, first producing what is
good, soon changes evil itself into good by
power working in a god-like manner. Goethe.

comes to pass. Pr.

That which produces and maintains cheerfulness
is nothing but activity. Jean Paul.

That which proves too much proves nothing.

be only the gilded index of far-reaching ruin;
a wrecker's handful of coin gleaned from the
beach to which he has beguiled an argosy.
Ruskin.

That which the droning world, chained to
appearances, will not allow the realist to
say in his own words, it will suffer him to say
in proverbs without contradiction. Emerson.

visible when the sun is out, and the stars are
fallen from heaven. Sir Thomas Browne.

honour. King John, iii. 1.

to remember. Pr.

adequately say, though we may repeat the
words never so often. Emerson.

That which we have we prize not to the                              15
worth; / But being lacked and lost, why
then we rake its value. Much Ado, iv. 1.

That's the best gown that goes up and down
the house. Pr.

That's the humour of it. Henry V., ii. 1.

That's what a man wants in a wife, mostly:                          25
he wants to make sure o' one fool as'll tell
him he's wise. But there's some men can do
wi'out that--they think so much o' themselves
a'ready--an' that's how it is there's
old bachelors. George Eliot.

The abandoning of some lower end in obedience
to a higher aim is often made the very condition
of securing the lower one. J. C. Sharp.

The abiding city and post at which we can
live and die is still ahead of us, it would
appear. Carlyle.

The absent one is an ideal person; those who
are present seem to one another to be quite
commonplace. It is a silly thing that the
ideal is, as it were, ousted by the real; that
may be the reason why to the moderns their
ideal only manifests itself in longing. Goethe.

The absent party is still faulty. Pr.

The accepted and betrothed lover has lost the                       30
wildest charms of his maiden in her acceptance

pursued her as a star--she cannot be heaven
if she stoops to such a one as he. Emerson.

to the sky in a night. Thackeray.

the soul to God. Tiedge.

noblest son, passed away. Willmott.

and the glory of Europe is extinguished for
ever. Burke.

The age of curiosity, like that of chivalry, is
ended, properly speaking, gone. Yet perhaps
only gone to sleep. Carlyle.

is for ever here. Carlyle.

always eminent for private virtue. Hume.

agnosticism of devotion as blindness for
want of vision from blindness through excess
of light. James Martineau.

furnish men with a standard of action and
a motive to work by, which shall not intensify

knowledge, what we know, as well as how
much and how well. Goethe.

The alpha and omega of Socialism is the
transmutation of private competing capital
into united collective capital. Schæffle.

The amateur, however weak may be his efforts
at imitation, need not be discouraged, ...
for one advances to an idea the more surely
and steadily the more accurately and precisely
he considers individual objects. Only
it will not do to measure one's self with
artists; every one must go on in his own
style. Goethe.

The ambitious are ever followed by adulation,
for such alone receive most pleasure from
flattery. Goldsmith.

The amount of intellect necessary to please us                       5
is a most accurate measure of the amount of
intellect we have ourselves. Helvetius.

is capable of serenity of mind and gladness
of heart. Jean Paul.

eye. H. Powers.

The arts of deceit and cunning do continually                       30
grow weaker, and less effectual and serviceable
to them that use them. Tillotson.

The astonishing intellect that occupies itself
in splitting hairs, and not in twisting some
kind of cordage and effectual draught tackle
to take the road with, is not to me the most
astonishing of intellects. I want twisted
cordage, steady pulling, and a peaceable bass
tone of voice; not split hairs, hysterical
spasmodics, and treble. Carlyle.

The Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington.
She was excellent at a slop or a puddle, but
she should not have meddled with a tempest.

Saadi.

The benefactors of mankind are those who

ground between both. Pr.

Butler.

The Bible contains more true sublimity, more
exquisite beauty, more pure morality, more
important history, and finer strains of poetry
and eloquence than can be collected from all
other books, in whatever age or language
they have been written. Sir William Jones.

(The Bible) contains plain teaching for men of
every rank of soul and state of life, which so
far as they honestly and implicitly obey, they
will be happy and innocent to the utmost
powers of their nature, and capable of victory
over all adversities, whether of temptation
or pain. Ruskin.

The Bible is the great family chronicle of the
Jews. Heine.

The Bible of a nation, the practically credited
God's message to a nation, is, beyond all
else, the authentic biography of its heroic
souls. This is the real record of the appearances
of God in the history of a nation;
this, which all men to the marrow of their
bones can believe, and which teaches all men
what the nature of this universe, when you
go to work in it, really is. Carlyle.

The Bible tells us what Christian graces are;                       25
but it is in the struggle of life that we are to
find them. Beecher.

works. No trifle is to be neglected. A

The bishop has set his foot in it, i.e., the broth is
singed. Pr. (The explanation of which, according
to Grose, is: Whenever a bishop passed through a
town or a village, all the inhabitants ran out to
receive his blessing; this frequently caused the
milk on the fire to be left till burnt.)

The biter is often bit. Pr.

The blanks as well as the prizes must be

start a hare. Hen. IV., i. 3.

Church. Tertullian.

The blue-bird carries the sky on his back.

With loads of learned lumber in his head.
Pope.

The books which help you most are those which
make you think the most. Theodore Parker.

The borrower runs in his own debt. Emerson.

The bough that is dead shall be cut away for
the sake of the tree itself. Let the Conservatism
that would preserve the tree, cut
it away. Carlyle.

concealed if he has but prudence. Goldsmith.

The boy stands astonished; his impressions                           5

steals on him by surprise. Goethe.

The boy's story is the best that is ever told.

are the daring. Bayard Taylor.

The breach of custom / Is breach of all. Cymbeline,
iv. 2.

it), all questions of philosophy and divinity.
Ruskin.

Scottish nation--has produced a finer set of
men than you will find it possible to get

always appears inimical to the unprepared
heart. Jean Paul.

The busiest of living agents are certain dead                       20
men's thoughts. Bovee.

The calling of a man's self to a strict account
is a medicine sometimes too piercing and
corrosive; reading good books of morality is
a little flat and dead ... but the best receipt
(best to work, and best to take) is the admonition
of a friend. Bacon.

The camomile, the more it is trodden on, the
faster it grows; yet youth, the more it is

Too oft before their buttons are disclosed, /
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth /
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Ham., i. 3.

The capacity of apprehending what is high is
very rare; and therefore, in common life a
man does well to keep such things for himself,
and only to give out so much as is needful
to have some advantage against others.
Goethe.

The captive bands may chain the hands, /
But love enslaves the man. Burns.

The Carlyles were men who lavished their
heart and conscience upon their work; they
builded themselves, their days, their thoughts
and sorrows, into their houses; they leavened
the soil with the sweat of their rugged brows.
John Burroughs.

The casting away things profitable for the
maintenance of man's life is an unthankful
abuse of the fruits of God's good providence
towards mankind. Hooker.

The castle which Conservatism is set to defend                      30
is the actual state of things, good and bad.
Emerson.

The cat shuts its eyes when stealing the
cream. Pr.

The cause which pleased the gods has in the
end to please Cato also. (?)

The centuries are all lineal children of one
another; and often, in the portrait of early
grandfathers, this and the other enigmatic
feature of the newest grandson will disclose
itself, to mutual elucidation. Carlyle.

The centuries are conspirators against the
sanity and authority of the soul. Emerson.

The certain way to be cheated is to fancy one's                     35
self more cunning than others. Charron.

The chains of habit are generally too small to
be felt till they are too strong to be broken.

th' untrodden bloodless field / The harvest
of her laurels yield. Keble.

The change of a man's self is a very laborious
undertaking. Thomas à Kempis.

The character of a nation is not to be learned
from its fine folks. Scott.

The character of the person that commends                           40
you is to be considered before you set a
value on his esteem. The wise man applauds
him whom he thinks most virtuous; the rest
of the world, him who is most wealthy. (?)

The character of the true philosopher is to
hope all things not unreasonable. Sir John
Herschel.

The characteristic mark of minds (Geister) of
the first order is the directness (Unmittelbarkeit)
of all their judgments. All that they
bring forth (vorbringen) is the result of their
own thinking. Schopenhauer.

The characteristic of a philosopher is that he
looks to himself for all help or harm. Epictetus.

The characteristic of Chaucer is intensity; of
Spencer, remoteness; of Milton, elevation:
of Shakespeare, everything. Hazlitt.

The chariest maid is prodigal enough / If she                       45
unmask her beauty to the moon. Ham.,

puts in at the window. Pr.

admit foul thoughts, without receiving their
tincture. Sterne.

Lets his soul run for nought. George Herbert.

The cheapness of man is every day's tragedy.
Emerson.

The chief glory of every people arises from its                      5
authors. Johnson.

The chief of all the curses of this unhappy age
is the universal gabble of its fools, and of the
flocks that follow them, rendering the quiet
voices of the wise of all past time inaudible.
Ruskin.

The chief requisites for a courtier are a flexible
conscience and an inflexible politeness. Lady
Blessington.

The chief value and virtue of money consists
in its having power over human beings; a
power which is attainable by other means
than by money. Ruskin.

The child is father of the man. Wordsworth.

The child is not to be educated for the present,                    10
but for the remote future, and often
in opposition to the immediate future. Jean
Paul.

The child who desires education will be
bettered by it; the child who dislikes it,
only disgraced. Ruskin.

The child's murmuring is more and is less than
words; there are no notes, and yet it is a
song; there are no syllables, and yet it is
language.... This poor stammering is a
compound of what the child said when it
was an angel, and of what it will say when
it becomes a man. Victor Hugo.

The childhood shows the man / As morning
shows the day. Milton.

The children of others we never love so much
as our own; error, our own child, is so near
our heart. Goethe.

The choicest thing this world has for a man is                      15
affection. J. G. Holland.

The Christian doctrine, that doctrine of Humility,
in all senses godlike, and the parent
of all godlike virtue, is not superior, or inferior,
or equal to any doctrine of Socrates
or Thales, being of a totally different nature;
differing from these as a perfect ideal poem
does from a correct computation in arithmetic.
Carlyle.

The Christian religion having once appeared,
cannot again vanish; having once assumed
its divine shape, can be subject to no dissolution.
Goethe.

The Christian religion is an inspiration and
life--God's life breathed into a man and
breathed through a man. J. G. Holland.

The Christian religion is especially remarkable,
as it so decidedly lays claim to mere
goodwill in man, to his essential temper,
and values this independently of all culture
and manifestation. It stands in opposition
to science and art, and properly to enjoyment.
Novalis.

The Christian religion, often enough dismembered                    20
and scattered abroad, will ever in the
end again gather itself together at the foot
of the cross. Goethe.

The Christian religion, once here, cannot again
pass away; in one or the other form, it will
endure through all time. As in Scripture, so
also in the heart of man, it is written, "The
gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
Carlyle.

The Christianity that cannot get on without a
minimum of four thousand five hundred, will
give place to something better that can.
Carlyle.

The Church is a mere organisation to help a
man to fulfil his duties; it is not the source
from whence those duties sprung. Ward
Beecher.

The Church is the working recognised union
of those who by wise teaching guide the
souls of men. Carlyle.

The Church! Touching the earth with one                             25
small point (the event, viz., at Bethlehem of
the year one); springing out of one small
seed-grain, rising out therefrom, ever higher,
ever broader, high as the heaven itself, broad
till it overshadow the whole visible heaven
and earth, and no star can be seen but
through it. From such a seed-grain so has
it grown; planted in the reverences and
sacred opulences of the soul of mankind; fed
continually by all the noblenesses of forty
generations of man. The world-tree of the
nations for so long! Carlyle.

The Churchmen fain would kill their Church, /
As the Churches have killed their Christ.
Tennyson.

The circle of noble-minded people is the most
precious of all that I have won. Goethe.

The city does not take away, neither does the
country give, solitude: solitude is within us.
Joseph Roux.

The city is recruited from the country. Emerson.

The civil guest / Will no more talk all, than                       30
eat all the feast. George Herbert.

The civilised man lives not in wheeled houses.
He builds stone castles, plants lands, makes
life-long marriage contracts; has long-dated,
hundred-fold possessions, not to be valued in
the money-market; has pedigrees, libraries,
law-codes; has memories and hopes, even
for this earth, that reach over thousands of
years. Carlyle.

The civilised nation consists broadly of mob,
money-collecting machine, and capitalist;
and when the mob wishes to spend money
for any purpose, it sets its money-collecting
machine to borrow the money it needs from
the capitalist, who lends it on condition of
taxing the mob generation after generation.
Ruskin.

The civilised savage (Wilde) is the worst of all
savages. C. J. Weber.

The Classical is healthy, the Romantic sickly.
Goethe.

The clergy are at present divided into three                        35
sections: an immense body who are ignorant;
a small proportion who know and are silent;
and a minute minority who know and speak
according to their knowledge. Huxley.

The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, /
The solemn temples, the great globe
itself, / Yea, all that it inherit, shall dissolve; /
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, /
Leave not a rack behind. Tempest, iv. 1.

The cloud incense of the altar hides / The
true form of the God who there abides. Dr.
W. Smith.

The clouds never pass against the wind.
Hitopadesa.

The clouds that gather round the setting sun /
Do take a sober colouring from an eye /
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality.
Wordsworth.

The clouds that wrap the setting sun / ...
Why, as we watch their floating wreath, /
Seem they the breath of life to breathe? /
To Fancy's eye their motions prove / They
mantle round the sun for love. Keble.

The clouds treat the sea as if it were a mill-pond                   5
or a spring-run, too insignificant to
make any exceptions to. John Burroughs.

The cock, that is the trumpet of the morn, /
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding
throat / Awake the god of day. Ham., i. 1.

The coin that is most current among mankind
is flattery; the only benefit of which is that
by hearing what we are not we may be
instructed what we ought to be. (?)

The combined arts appear to me like a family
of sisters, of whom the greater part were
inclined to good company, but one was light-headed,
and desirous to appropriate and
squander the whole goods and chattels of the
household--the theatre is this wasteful sister.
Goethe.

The comic and the tragic lie close together,
inseparable, like light and shadow. Socrates.

The command "thou shalt" is in all circumstances                    10
a hard one, unless it is softened
down by the adjunct "for that which 'thou
shalt' is just the same as that which rationally
thou also willest." Lindner.

The commencement of atonement is / The
sense of its necessity. Byron.

The common crowd but see the gloom / Of
wayward deeds and fitting doom; / The close
observer can espy / A noble soul and lineage
high. Byron.

The common fluency of speech in many men
and most women is owing to a scarcity of
matter and a scarcity of words. Swift.

The common "keeping up appearances" of
society is a mere selfish struggle of the vain
with the vain. Ruskin.

The company of fools may at first make us                           15
smile, but at last never fails of rendering
us melancholy. Goldsmith.

The complete poet must have a heart in his
brain or a brain in his heart. George Darley.

The complete spiritualisation of the animal
element in nature is the task of our species.
Amiel.

The conceived is never food save to the mind
that conceives. Schiller.

The concessions of the weak are the concessions
of fear. Burke.

The condition of the great body of the people in                    20
a country is the condition of the country
itself. Carlyle.

The condition of the most fascinated (bezaubertsten)
enthusiast is to be preferred to him
who, from sheer fear of error, dares in the
end no longer to affirm or deny. Wieland.

The conditions necessary for the arts of men
are the best for their souls and bodies. Ruskin.

The confidant of my vices is my master, though
he were my valet. Goethe.

The conflict of the old, the existent, and the
persistent, with development, improvement,
and transfigurment is always the same. Out
of every arrangement arises at last pedantry;
to get rid of this latter the former is
destroyed, and some time must elapse before
we become aware that order must be re-established.
Goethe.

The conscience is the inviolable asylum of the                      25
liberty of man. Napoleon.

The conscience is the most elastic material in
the world. To-day you cannot stretch it
over a mole-hill, to-morrow it hides a mountain.
Bulwer Lytton.

The conscience of the man who is given over
to his passions is like the voice of the shipwrecked
mariner overwhelmed by the tempest.
Joseph Roux.

The conscious utterance of thought by speech
or action, to any end, is art. Emerson.

The conscious water saw its god and blushed.
Dryden, on the water into wine at Cana.

The consolation which is derived from truth,                        30
if any there be, is solid and durable; that
which may be derived from error must be,
like its original, fallacious and fugitive.
Johnson.

The contagion of crime is like that of the
plague. Napoleon.

The contingent facts of history can never become
the proof of the truths of reason.
Lessing.

The conversation of a friend is a powerful
alleviator of the fatigue of walking. Dr.
Andrew Combe.

The core will come to the surface. Emerson.

The cormorant Oblivion swallows up / The                            35
carcases that Time has made his prey.
Crowe.

The corpse is not the whole animal; there is
still something that appertains to it, still
a corner-stone, and in this case, as in
every other, a very chief corner-stone--life,
the spirit that makes everything beautiful.
Goethe.

The counsel thou wouldst have another keep,
first keep thyself. Pr.

The country where the entire people is, or
even once has been, laid hold of, filled to the
heart with an infinite religious idea, has
"made a step from which it cannot retrograde."
Carlyle.

The courage (Muth) of truth is the first condition
of philosophic study. Hegel.

The courage that dares only die is on the                           40
whole no sublime affair.... The courage
we desire and prize is not the courage to
die decently, but to live manfully. Carlyle.

The course of nature is the art of God. Young.

The course of Nature's phases, on this our
little fraction of a planet, is partially known
to us; but who knows what deeper courses
these depend on; what infinitely larger cycle
(of causes) our little epicycle revolves on?
Carlyle.

The course of prayer who knows? Keble.

The course of scoundrelism, any more than
that of true love, never did run smooth.
Carlyle.

The course of true love never did run smooth.
Mid. N.'s Dream, i. 1.

The court does not render a man contented,
but it prevents his being so elsewhere. La
Bruyère.

The court is like a palace of marble; it is composed
of people very hard and very polished.
La Bruyère.

The court, nor cart, I like, nor loathe; / Extremes
are counted worst of all: / The golden
mean betwixt them both / Doth surest sit,
and fears no fall. Old ballad.

The court of the past differs from all living                        5
aristocracy in this; it is open to labour and
to merit, but to nothing else. Ruskin.

The covetous man heaps up riches, not to
enjoy them, but to have them. Tillotson.

The covetous man never has money, and the
prodigal will have none shortly. Johnson.

The coxcomb is a fool of parts, a flatterer, a
knave of parts. Steele.

The craftiest wiles are too short and ragged a
cloak to cover a bad heart. Lavater.

The crafty man is always in danger; and                             10
when he thinks he walks in the dark, all
his pretences are so transparent, that he
that runs may read them. Tillotson.

The creed of the true saint is to make the best

sense / Repairs itself by rest. Cymbeline,
ii. 2.

The cross is the invincible sanctuary of the                        15
humble. Cass.

The cross of Christ is the key of Paradise;
the weak man's staff; the convert's convoy;
the upright man's perfection; the soul and
body's health; the prevention of all evil,
and the procurer of all good. Damascen.

The cross was the fitting close of a life of
rejection, scorn, and defeat. W. H. Thomson.

The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark /
When neither is attended, and I think / The
nightingale, if she should sing by day, /
when every goose is cackling, would be
thought / No better a musician than the
wren. Mer. of Venice, v. 1.

The crowd ... if they find / Some stain or
blemish in a name of note, / Not grieving
that their greatest are so small, / Inflate
themselves with some insane delight, / And
judge all Nature from her feet of clay, /
Without the will to lift their eyes, and see /
Her godlike head crown'd with spiritual
fire / And touching other worlds. Tennyson.

The cruelty of the affectionate is more dreadful                    20

demur. W. R. Greg.

The cure for false theology is mother wit.
Emerson.

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, / The
lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea, / The
ploughman homeward plods his weary way, /
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Gray.

The curiosity of knowing things has been
given to man for a scourge. Apocrypha.

The curious unthrift makes his clothes too
wide, / And spares himself, but would his
tailor chide. George Herbert.

Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently
doth rage. Two Gent. of Ver., ii. 7.

The curtains of yesterday drop down, the
curtains of to-morrow roll up; but yesterday

passed away. Cowper.

The day is longer than the brae; we'll be at
the top yet. Gael. Pr.

inward eye opens to the unity of things, to
the omnipresence of law--sees that what is
must be, and ought to be, or is the best.
Emerson.

one's self. Dickens.

The days are too short even for love, how can
there ever be time for quarrelling? Mrs.
Gatty.

The dead do not need us; but for ever and
for evermore we need them. Garfield.

dead, and drop piecemeal into dust, if the
living spirit of religion, freed from its charnel-house,
is to arise on us, new born of
Heaven, and with new healing under its
wings. Carlyle.

The decline of literature indicates the decline                     45

conservative is an old democrat. Emerson.

understanding can reach it, and an influence
flows from it which masters all, and for which
none can account. Goethe.

man is better than a liar. Bible.

that ever afflicted the human mind. Fontanes.

excess caused man to fall; but in charity
there is no excess, neither can man or angel
come in danger by it. Bacon.

night for the morrow, / The devotion to
something afar / From the sphere of our

such as he findeth occupied in good works.

was he. Rabelais.

The dewdrop and the star shine sisterly, /
Globing together in the common work. Sir
Edwin Arnold.

The dictum that truth always triumphs over

... which all experience refutes. History

by persecution. If not suppressed for ever, it
may be thrown back for centuries. J. S. Mill.

The difference between Socrates and Jesus?
The great Conscious; the immeasurably
great Unconscious. Carlyle.

The difference between the great celebrities
and the unknown nobodies is this, the former

up in despair. Anon.

to find a friend worth dying for. Henry Home.

something can be both true and untrue at
the same time. Schopenhauer.

The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.
Ben Jonson.

The dilettante takes the obscure for the profound,
violence for vigour, the indefinite for
the infinite, and the senseless for the supersensuous.
Schiller.

The disciple is not above his master, nor the
servant above his lord. Jesus.

The discovery of what is true, and the practice                     40
of that which is good, are the two most
important objects of philosophy. Voltaire.

The discretion of a man deferreth his anger;
and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.

The disease of the mind leading to fatalist
ruin is the concentration of man upon himself,
whether his heavenly interests or his
worldly interests, matters not; it is their
being his own interests which makes the regard
of them mortal. Ruskin.

The disease which afflicts bureaucratic governments,
and which they usually die of, is
routine. J. S. Mill.

The disease with which the human mind now
labours is want of faith. Emerson.

it seldom go together. Young.

fortune are worthy of attention; but not of
two, the one great, the other humble. Hitopadesa.

The dissection of a sentence is as bad a way
to the understanding of it, as the dissection
of a beast to the biography of it. Ruskin.

seas, but by ignorances; and their divisions
determined, not by dialects, but by enmities.

our gazing. Keble.

The distant sounds of music, that catch new                         50
sweetness as they vibrate through the long-drawn
valley, are not more pleasing to the
ear than the tidings of a far-distant friend.

price and be bought for it. Ruskin.

of operation on every lowly bank and mouldering
stone, as in the lifting of the pillars of
heaven, and setting the foundations of the
earth. Ruskin.

The divine power of the love, of which we
cease not to sing and speak, is this, that it
reproduces every moment the grand qualities
of the beloved object, perfect in the smallest
parts, embraced in the whole; it rests not
either by day or by night, is ravished with
its own work, wonders at its own stirring
activity, finds the well-known always new,
because it is every moment begotten anew
in the sweetest of all occupations. In fact
the image of the beloved one cannot become
old, for every moment is the hour of its birth.
Goethe.

The divine state, "par excellence," is silence
and repose. Amiel.

The doctor sees all the weakness of mankind,
the lawyer all the wickedness, the theologian
all the stupidity. Schopenhauer.

one that catches it. Ger. Pr.

The dog, to gain his private ends, / Went
mad, and bit the man. Goldsmith.

The dome of St. Peter's is great, yet is it but
a foolish chip of an egg-shell compared with
that star-fretted dome where Arcturus and
Orion glance for ever, which latter, notwithstanding,
no one looks at--because the
architect was not a man. Carlyle.

The dome of thought, the palace of the soul.
Byron.

The donkey means one thing and the driver
another. Pr.

The doom of the old has long been pronounced                        15
and irrevocable; the old has passed away;
but, alas! the new appears not in its stead;
the time is still in pangs of travail with the
new. Man has walked by the light of conflagrations,
and amid the sound of falling
cities; and now there is darkness, and long
watching till it be morning. Carlyle in
1831.

The door must either be shut or it must be
open. I must either be natural or unnatural.
Goldsmith.

The dove found no rest for the sole of her foot.
Bible.

The dread of censure is the death of genius.
Simms.

The dread of something after death, / The undiscover'd
country, from whose bourn / No
traveller returns, puzzles the will; / And
makes us rather bear those ills we have /
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Ham., iii. 1.

The dreamer is a madman quiescent, the                              20
madman is a dreamer in action. F. H.
Hedge.

they fall back to the bottom by their own
coarseness. Joubert.

The dress of words, / Like to the Roman girl's
enticing garb, / Should let the play of limb
be seen through it, / And the round rising
form. Bailey.

The drunkard forfeits man, and doth divest /
All worldly right, save what he hath by beast.
George Herbert.

The dry light is ever the best. Heraclitus.

The drying up a single tear has more / Of                           25
honest fame than shedding seas of gore.
Byron.

The dullest John Bull cannot with perfect
complacency adore himself, except under
the figure of Britannia or the British Lion.
Byron.

The dust of controversy is but the falsehood
flying off. Carlyle.

The dwarf behind his steam-engine may remove
mountains, but no dwarf will hew them
down with the pickaxe; and he must be a
Titan that hurls them abroad with his arms.
Carlyle.

The eagle suffers little birds to sing. Tit.
Andron., iv. 4.

The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, /                         30
And these are of them. Macb., i. 3.

curse it; we are bound to sanctify it.
Mazzini.

heavens are studded with stars, wherever
the conditions of existence are unsophisticated.

of life before he has leisure or inclination
to pursue more refined enjoyments.

Comes dear'd by being lack'd. Ant. and
Cleop., i. 4.

The echo of the nest-life, the voice of our
modest, fairer, holier soul, is audible only in
a sorrow-darkened bosom, as the nightingales
warble when one veils their cage.
Jean Paul.

The effect of good music is not caused by
its novelty; on the contrary, it strikes us
more the more familiar we are with it.
Goethe.

The effect of righteousness (shall be) quietness
and assurance for ever. Bible.

The effect of violent animosities between                           40
parties has always been an indifference to
the general welfare and honour of the state.
Macaulay.

The efforts of him who contendeth with one
stronger than himself are as feeble as the
exertions of an insect's wings. Hitopadesa.

The elect are whosoever will, and the non-elect
whosoever won't. Ward Beecher.

The electric telegraph will never be a substitute
for the face of a man, with his soul
in it, encouraging another man to be brave
and true. Dickens.

The element of water moistens the earth, but
blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens.

in the vicissitudes of human life, in the emotions
of the human heart, and the relations
of man to man. Bryant.

The emphasis of facts and persons has nothing
to do with time. Emerson.

The empire of woman is an empire of softness,                        5

are caresses, her menaces are tears.
Rousseau.

The empty vessel makes the greatest sound.
Hen. V., iv. 4.

The end crowns all, / And that old common
arbitrator, Time, / Will one day end it.
Troil. and Cress., iv. 5.

The end of all opposition is negation, and negation
is nothing. Goethe.

The end of all right education of a woman is to
make her love her home better than any
other place; that she should as seldom leave
it as a queen her queendom; nor ever feel
entirely at rest but within its threshold.
Ruskin.

The end of doubt is the beginning of repose.                        10
Petrarch.

The end of labour is to gain leisure. Arist.

The end of man is an action, not a thought,
though it were the noblest. Carlyle.

but a performance; and life always and only
the continual fulfilment of a worthy purpose

way. Jean Paul.

The enemy is more easily repulsed if we never                       15
suffer him to get within us, but, upon the
very first approach, draw up our forces and
fight him without the gate. Thomas à Kempis.

"The English," says Bishop Sprat, "have too
much bravery to be derided, and too much
virtue and honour to mock others." Goldsmith.

The ennobling difference between one man and
another--between one animal and another--is
precisely this, that one feels more than
another. Ruskin.

given where griefs are great. Palladas.

of his neighbours. Socrates.

The envious will die, but envy never. Molière.

The errors of a great mind are more edifying                        25
than the truths of a little. Börne.

The errors of a wise man are literally more
instructive than the truths of a fool. For
the wise man travels in lofty, far-seeing
regions; the fool in low-lying, high-fenced
lanes; retracing the footsteps of the former, to
discover where he deviated, whole provinces
of the universe are laid open to us; in the
path of the latter, granting even that he have
not deviated at all, little is laid open to us but
two wheel-ruts and two hedges. Carlyle.

The errors of a wise man make your rule /
Rather than the perfections of a fool. Wm.
Blake.

The errors of woman spring almost always
from her faith in the good or her confidence
in the true. Balzac.

but the errors of aged men amount
to but this, that more might have been done,
or sooner. Bacon.

The essence of a lie is in deception, not in                        30
words. Ruskin.

The essence of affectation is that it be assumed;
the character is, as it were, forcibly crushed
into some foreign mould, in the hope of being
thereby re-shaped and beautified; and the
unhappy man persuades himself he has become
a new creature of wonderful symmetry,
though every movement betrays not symmetry,
but dislocation. Carlyle.

The essence of all government among good
men is this, that it is mainly occupied in the
production and recognition of human worth,
and in the detection and extinction of human
unworthiness. Ruskin.

The essence of all immorality, of sin, is the making
self the centre to which we subordinate
all other beings and interests. J. C. Sharp.

The essence of all religion that was, and that
will be, is to make men free. Carlyle.

The essence of all vulgarity lies in want of                        35
sensation. Ruskin.

The essence of an aristocracy is to transfer
the source of honour from the living to the
dead, to make the merits of living men depend
not so much upon their own character
and actions as upon the actions and position
of their ancestors. H. Lecky.

The essence of aphorism is the compression
of a mass of thought and observation into a
single saying. John Morley.

The essence of faith lies in this, a deep sense
and conviction that in what we do, though it
were single-handed, with all men standing
aloof, and even saying nay to it, we have
God and all his universe at our back. Ed.

The essence of friendship is entireness, a total
magnanimity and trust. Emerson.

The essence of greatness is the perception                          40
that virtue is enough. Poverty is its ornament.
It does not need plenty, and can very
well abide its loss. Emerson.

The essence of humour is sensibility, warm,
tender, fellow-feeling with all forms of existence;
and unless seasoned and purified
by humour, sensibility is apt to run wild,
will readily corrupt into disease, falsehood,
or, in one word, sentimentality. Carlyle.

The essence of justice is mercy. (?)

The essence of knowledge is, having it, to
apply it; not having it, to confess your ignorance.
Confucius.

The essence of poetry is will and passion.
Hazlitt.

The essence of true nobility is neglect of self.
Let the thought of self pass in, and the
beauty of a great action is gone, like the
bloom from a soiled flower. Froude.

The essence of wealth consists in its authority
over men; if (therefore) the apparent or
nominal wealth fail in this power, it fails in
essence; in fact, ceases to be wealth at all.
And since the essence of wealth consists in
power over men, will it not follow that the
nobler and the more in number the persons
are over whom it has power, the greater the
wealth. Ruskin.

The essence or peculiarity of man is to comprehend
a whole. Emerson.

The essential thing for all creatures is to be                       5
made to do right. Ruskin.

The Eternal is no simulacrum; God is not only
there, but here or nowhere,--in that life-breath
of thine, in that act and thought of
thine,--and thou wert wise to look to it.
Carlyle.

The eternal stars shine out again, as soon as
it is dark enough. Carlyle.

The eternity, before the world and after, is
without our reach; but that little spot of
ground which lies betwixt those two great
oceans, this we are to cultivate. Burnet.

The even and cheerful temper makes us
pleasing to ourselves, to those with whom
we converse, and to Him whom we were
made to please. Addison.

The even-flow of constant cheerfulness                              10
strengthens; while great excitements, driving
us with fierce speed, both wreck the
ship and end often in explosions. Ward
Beecher.

The evening brings a' hame. Sc. Pr.

The evil that goeth out of thy mouth flieth
into thy bosom. Pr.

good is oft interréd with their bones. Jul.

The evil wound is cured, but not the evil name.
Pr.

The ewe that will not hear her lamb when it                         15
baes, will never answer a calf when it bleats.
Much Ado, iii. 3.

The exacting a grateful acknowledgment is
demanding a debt by which the creditor is
not advantaged and the debtor pays with
reluctance. Goldsmith.

The example of good men is visible philosophy.
Pr.

The excellent is rarely found, more rarely
valued. Goethe.

The exception proves the rule. Pr.

our age, payable with interest about thirty
years after date. Colton.

for ever. Bible.

new confession, and the world seems always
waiting for its poet. Emerson.

on the highest authority to be necessary to
every poet who would touch the hearts of
his fellow-creatures. C. Fitzhugh.

at present, while the unexpress, for good or
for evil, is so busy with a poor little fellow.

The eye is the mirror of the soul. Pr.

The eye is the only note-book of the true poet.                     30
Lowell.

The eye is the window of the soul; even an
animal looks for a man's intentions right
into his eyes. H. Powers.

The eye--it cannot choose but see; / We cannot
bid the ear be still; / Our bodies feel,
where'er they be, / Against or with our
will. Wordsworth.

The eye of a critic is often like a microscope,
made so very fine and nice, that it discovers
the atoms, grains, and minutest particles,
without ever comprehending the whole, comparing
the parts, or seeing all at once the
harmony. (?)

The eye of the master will do more work than
both his hands. Ben. Franklin.

The eye repeats every day the first eulogy on                       35
things: "He saw that they were very good."
Emerson.

The eye sees in all things what it brings with
it the faculty of seeing. Goethe.

to obey his mother, the ravens of
the valley shall pick it out, and the young
eagles shall eat it. Bible.

itself. Pr.

The eyes being in the highest part, hold the                        40
post of sentinels. Cic.

The eyes of other people are the eyes that
ruin us. If all but myself were blind, I
would want neither fine clothes, fine houses,
nor fine furniture. Ben. Franklin.

The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding
the evil and the good. Bible.

The face is the index of the mind. Pr.

The face of man gives us fuller and more
interesting information than his tongue; for
his face is the compendium of all he will ever
say, as it is the one record of all he has thought
and endeavoured. Schopenhauer.

The faculty for remembering is not diminished                       45
in proportion to what one has learnt, just as
little as the number of moulds in which you
cast sand lessens its capacity for being cast
in new moulds. Schopenhauer.

The faculty of art is to change events; the
faculty of science is to foresee them. The
phenomena with which we deal are controlled
by art; they are predicted by science. Buckle.

The faculty of listening is a tender thing, and
soon becomes weary and satiated. Luther.

The failings of good men are commonly more
published in the world than their good deeds;
and one fault of a deserving man shall meet
with more reproaches than all his virtues

The faith in an Invisible, Unnameable, Godlike,

remains credible? Carlyle.

relates. Paley.

Emerson.

border. Burns.

weeds. Wall.

The fox puts off all with a jest. L'Estrange.

The fox thrives best when he is most curst. Pr.

not so much by increasing your numerator
as by lessening your denominator. Nay,
unless my algebra deceives me, unity itself
divided by zero will give infinity. Carlyle.

of this universe; who in his heart sees and
knows that injustice cannot befall him here;
that, except by sloth and cowardly falsity,
evil is not possible here. Carlyle.

lies, and against a betrayal of love. Ruskin.                      25

best), but even without that a man learneth
of himself, and bringeth his own thoughts to

stone, which itself cuts not. Bacon.

in this beauteous world. Goethe.

at all. Ruskin.

The happiness of man depends on no creed                            10

The highest gift which we receive from God                          40
and Nature is Life, the revolving movement,

Emerson.

The history of the Church is a history of the
invisible as well as of the visible Church;
which latter, if disjoined from the former, is
but a vacant edifice; gilded, it may be, and
overhung with old votive gifts, yet useless,
nay, pestilentially unclean; to write whose
history is less important than to forward its
downfall. Carlyle.

The history of the world is nothing but the
history of successful or unsuccessful grumbling;

... inculcating through all of them the great
moral, that it is not good for a man to be
contented with evils that he can remove.
John Wagstaffe.

The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be

the giver is bare. Lowell.

away. Luther.

The human heart is like heaven; the more
angels the more room. Fredrika Bremer.

such cases, to fly into direct variance with
reason and common-sense. Goethe.

The imagination of man's heart is evil from his

and as we drift into new latitudes new

little time much beneath them, or, as the
Italian proverb says, "The man who lives
by hope will die by despair." Addison.

at large with somewhat more of certainty
than he who devotes himself to charities.

may render the purchase too dear, by being
bought at the terrible price of our neighbour's
dislike. Lover.

The manners of the ill-mannered are never so
odious, unbearable, exasperating, as they
are to their own nearest kindred. P. G.
Hamerton.

The many still must labour for the one! It is
Nature's doom. Byron.

The march of intellect is proceeding at quick
time; and if its progress be not accompanied
by a corresponding improvement in morals
and religion, the faster it proceeds, with the
more violence will you be hurried down the
road to ruin. Southey.

The march of intellect, which licks all the
world into shape, has reached even the devil.
Goethe.

The march of the human mind is slow. Burke.                       30

The mark of the man of the world is absence
of pretension. He does not make a speech;
he takes a low business-tone, avoids all brag,
is nobody, dresses plainly, promises not at
all, performs much, speaks in monosyllables,
hugs his fact. He calls his employment by
its lowest name, and so takes from evil
tongues their sharpest weapon. Emerson.

The marks of attachment, even to a fault, are
an accumulation of virtues. Hitopadesa.

The mass of men consulted at hustings, upon
any high matter whatsoever, is as ugly an
exhibition of human study as the world sees.
Carlyle.

The master of slaves has seldom the soul of a
man. Henry Mackenzie.

The master-spirit who can rule the storm is                         35
great; but he is much greater who can both
raise and rule it. E. L. Magoon.

The mastiff is quiet while curs are yelping.
Pr.

of its possessions which feeds and educates
good men and women in it. Ruskin.

again. Schiller.

The mean of true valour lies between the extremes
of cowardice and rashness. Cervantes.

The means that Heaven yields must be embraced,                      40
/ And not neglected. Rich. II., iii. 2.

The measure of a master is his success in
bringing all men round to his opinion twenty
years later. Emerson.

The mechanical occupations of man, the watching
any object, as it were, coming into existence
by manual labour, is a very pleasant way
of passing one's time, but our own activity
is at the moment nil. It is almost the same
as with smoking tobacco. Goethe.

The meditative heart / Attends the warning
of each day and hour, / And practises in
secret every virtue. Goethe.

The meek shall inherit the earth. Jesus.

The memory of absent friends becomes dimmed,
although not effaced by time. The distractions
of our life, acquaintance with fresh
objects, in short, every change in our condition,
works upon our hearts as dust and
smoke upon a painting, making the finely
drawn lines quite imperceptible, whilst one
does not know how it happens. Goethe.

The memory of the just is blessed. Bible.

The men I am afraid of are the men who believe
everything, subscribe to everything,
and vote for everything. Bp. Shipley.

The merchant who was at first busy in acquiring
money ceases to grow richer from
the time when he makes it his business only
to count it. Johnson.

The merciful shall obtain mercy. Jesus.                            5

The mere existence and necessity of a philosophy
is an evil. Carlyle.

The mere reality of life would be inconceivably
poor without the charm of fancy, which
brings in its bosom, no doubt, as many vain
fears as idle hopes, but lends much oftener
to the illusions it calls up a gay flattering
hue than one which inspires terror. W. v.
Humboldt.

The merit of originality is not novelty, it is
sincerity. The believing man is the original
man; whatsoever he believes, he believes it
for himself, not for another. Carlyle.

The meteor flag of England, / Shall yet terrific
burn, / Till danger's troubled night depart, /
And the star of peace return. Campbell.

The milder virtues subsist only in co-existence                     10
with the severer, and the heart which pronounces
a blessing on the poor and the merciful
utters with the same breath sentence
of excommunication against all who are
proud-spirited and cruel-hearted. Ed.

The mill will never grind with the water that
is past. Pr.

The mind becomes bankrupt under too large
obligations. All additional benefits lessen
every hope of future returns, and bar up
every avenue that leads to tenderness. Goldsmith.

The mind can make / Substance, and people
planets of its own / With beings brighter
than have been, and give / A breath to forms
that can outlive all flesh. Byron.

forth with delight. Joubert.

make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
Milton.

The mind must not yield to the body. Goethe.                      20

The mind of a fool is empty; and everything
is empty where there is poverty. Hitopadesa.

The mind of a good man doth not alter, even
when he is in distress; the waters of the
ocean are not to be heated by a torch of
straw. Hitopadesa.

The mind of man is no inert receptacle of
knowledge, but absorbs and incorporates
into its own constitution the ideas which it
receives. H. Lecky.

The mind of the greatest man on earth is not
so independent of circumstances as not to
feel inconvenienced by the merest buzzing
noise about him; it does not need the report
of a cannon to disturb his thoughts. The
creaking of a vane or a pulley is quite enough.
Do not wonder that he reasons ill just now;
a fly is buzzing by his ear; it is quite enough
to unfit him for giving good counsel. Pascal.

The mind profits by the wrecks of every                             25
passion, and we may measure our road to
wisdom by the sorrows we have undergone.
Bulwer Lytton.

The mind that made the world is not one mind,
but the mind. Emerson.

pupil of the human eye, contract themselves
the more the stronger light there is shed
upon them. Moore.

wrought were the scaffolding, not the building.
The scaffolding is removed as soon as
the building is finished. Lessing.

The miser is as much in want of that which he                       30
has as of that which he has not. Pub. Syr.

The miser is niggardly in death; two glances
he casts on his coffin and a thousand with
dismay on his anxiously-guarded treasures.
Gellert.

The miserable have no other medicine, / But
only hope. Meas. for Meas., iii. 1.

The misery of man proceeds not from any
single crush of overwhelming evil, but from
small vexations continually repeated. Johnson.

The misfortune in the state is that nobody can
enjoy life in peace, but that everybody must
govern; and in art, that nobody will enjoy
what has been produced, but that every one
wants to reproduce on his own account.
Goethe.

The mixtures of spiritual chemistry refuse to                       35
be analysed. Emerson.

The mob has many heads, but no brains. Pr.

The mob is a monster, with the hands of
Briareus but the head of Polyphemus,--strong
to execute, but blind to perceive.
Colton.

The mob is a sort of bear; while your ring is
through its nose, it will even dance under
your cudgel; but should the ring slip and
you lose your hold, the brute will turn and
rend you. Jane Porter.

(The mob is) the scum that rises uppermost
when the nation boils. Dryden.

The modest virgin, the prudent wife, or the                         40
careful matron, are much more serviceable
in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering
heroines, or virago queens. Goldsmith.

disarmed of its poison, though not of its pain.

to itself if it is to become a worthy segment

from the cottage of a Chandala (outcast).
Hitopadesa.

The moon that shone in Paradise. Hans Andersen.

The moral difference between a man and a
beast is, that the one acts primarily for use,
and the other for pleasure. Ruskin.

The morality of a king is not to be measured                         5
by vulgar rules. There are faults which do
him honour, and virtues that disgrace him.
Junius.

The morality of girls is custom, not principle.
Jean Paul.

The morality of some people is in remnants--never
enough to make a coat. Joubert.

The more a man has in himself the less he will
want from other people--the less, indeed,
other people can be to him. Schopenhauer.

Amiel.

The more angels the more room. Swedenborg.                        10

he is able to accomplish; for he learns to

you will have to endure, and the fewer punishments
to enforce. Ruskin.

The more men refine upon pleasure, the less
will they indulge in excesses of any kind.
Hume.

The more of the solid there is in a man, the
less does he act the balloon. Spurgeon.

The more powerful the obstacle, the more                            20
glory we have in overcoming it; and the
difficulties with which we are met are the
maids of honour which set off virtue. Molière.

The more profound the thought, the more
burdensome. Emerson.

The more riches a fool has, the greater fool he
is. Anon.

of our life, the clearer we should see
through it. Jean Paul.

Christian he is. Novalis.

much the more dost thou resemble the gods.
Goethe.

more busy we are, the more leisure we
have. Hazlitt.

The more we have read, the more we have
learned, the more we have meditated, the
better conditioned we are to affirm that we
know nothing. Voltaire.

The more we know, the greater our thirst for

sympathy than the parched shrub in a sandy
desert. Coleridge.

The more we work, the more we shall be                              30
trodden down. Fr. Peasant Pr.

you are. Disraeli.

The morning stars sang together, and all the
sons of God shouted for joy. Bible.

The most advanced nations are always those
who navigate the most. Emerson.

clouded mind, as lightning leaps only from an
obscure firmament. Bovee.

The most certain sign of wisdom is a continual
cheerfulness. Montaigne.

The most civilised are as near to barbarism as
the most polished steel to rust. Nations,
like metals, have only a superficial brilliancy.

degree of reserve adds vastly to the latent
force of character. Tuckerman.

hundredth part of the charm of a conversation.

The most difficult thing in life is to know yourself.               40
Thales.

The most elevated sensation of music arises
from a confused perception of ideal or visionary
beauty and rapture, which is sufficiently
perceivable to fire the imagination, but not
clear enough to become an object of knowledge.
James Usher.

The most enthusiastic Evangelicals do not
preach a gospel, but keep describing how it
should and might be preached; to awaken
the sacred fire of faith, as by a sacred contagion,
is not their endeavour, but, at most,
to describe how faith shows and acts, and
scientifically distinguish true faith from false.
Carlyle in 1831.

The most enthusiastic mystics were women.
Jean Paul.

The most essential fact about a man is the

one's self. Goethe.

they have to say as if it had never been said
before. Goethe.

in attaining them. Goethe.

The most significant feature in the history of
an epoch is the manner it has of welcoming
a great man. Carlyle.

man, and yet he is the proudest. Montaigne.

himself with being virtuous without
seeking to appear so. Plato.

The mother-grace of all the graces is Christian
good-will. Ward Beecher.

The mother of the useful arts is necessity; that

former has intellect; the latter, genius, which
itself is a kind of luxury. Schopenhauer.

The mother's heart is always with her children.
Pr.

The mother's yearning feels the presence of
the cherished child even in the degraded
man. George Eliot.

life: but violence covereth the mouth of the
wicked. Bible.

in our toilsome course with sweet remembrances.
Novalis.

The music in my heart I bore / Long after it
was heard no more. Wordsworth.

The nation is governed by all that has tongue

is he like the eagle. Goethe.

never blenches, the thought that never wanders--these
are the masters of victory. Burke.

that text be enough. Prof. Blackie, to young
men.

The noble character at certain moments may

The nobler the virtue is, the more eager and
generous resolution do thou express of
attaining to it. Thomas à Kempis.

always mistaken by musicians. James Usher.

The noblest mind the best contentment hath.
Spenser.

The noblest vengeance is to forgive. Pr.

The noblest works and foundations have proceeded                    10

those of their bodies have failed. Bacon.

every given space of ground. Ruskin.

intelligence, but to fortify the feebleness of
human resolutions. Sydney Smith.

The object of reading is not to dip into everything
that even wise men have ever written.
John Morley.

The object of the poet is, and must be, to
"instruct by pleasing," yet not by pleasing
this man and that man; only by pleasing
man, by speaking to the pure nature of man,
can any real "instruction," in this sense, be
conveyed. Carlyle.

The object of the politician is expediency,                         20
and his duty is to adapt his measures to the
often crude, undeveloped, and vacillating
conception of the nation. The object, on
the other hand, of the philosopher is truth,
and his duty is to push every principle which
he believes to be true to its legitimate consequences,
regardless of the results that may
follow. H. Lecky.

The object of true religion should be to impress
the principles of morality deeply in the soul.
Leibnitz.

new, / And God fulfils himself in many
ways, / Lest one good custom should corrupt
the world. Tennyson.

The old prose writers wrote as if they were
speaking to an audience; while among us
prose is invariably written for the eye alone.
Niebuhr.

The older we get the more we must limit ourselves,
if we wish to be active. Goethe.

The oldest, and indeed only true, order of
nobility known under the stars, is that of
just men and sons of God, in opposition to
unjust men and sons of Belial, which latter
indeed are second oldest, and yet a very
unvenerable order. Carlyle.

experienced, and he who has suffered most
has not always the best manners. Bodenstedt.

The one enemy we have in this universe is                           35
stupidity, darkness of mind; of which darkness
there are many sources, every sin a

is to know that it is wrong; how to get out
of it you can decide afterwards at your
leisure. Ruskin.

of freedom in the self-conscious soul. Ed.

The only failure a man ought to fear is failure
in cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best.
George Eliot.

colour in all weathers, is that which is woven
of conviction, and set with the sharp mordant
of experience. Lowell.

multitude only, and scarcely that. Goethe.

hundred times a day, and that of doing
good once a year. Voltaire.

a thousand victories, once foil'd, / Is from the
books of honour razèd quite, / And all the
rest forgot for which he toil'd. Shakespeare.

The painter should grind his own colours; the
architect work in the mason's yard with his

and the authority and wealth which these
must naturally and justly obtain. Ruskin.

which they are charged to defend. Ruskin.

The passions rise higher at domestic than at
imperial tragedies. Johnson.

virgin's. Jean Paul.

those Indians who were found to

and bright, sacred and profane, coarse and

beauty appear. Lord Halifax.

The plainest man that can convince a woman
that he is really in love with her, has done
more to make her in love with him than the

only when ingrafted on that love which is
rooted in the breast of another. Colton.

The pleasure of despising, at all times and in

about happiness. J. C. Sharp.

derived from the beauty and congruity it
sees or conceives in those things which the
sight or imagination lay before it. Cervantes.

promise more than they give. They trouble
us in seeking them, they do not satisfy us
when possessing them, and they make us
despair in losing them. Mme. de Lambert.

The plenty of the poorest place is too great;                       10
the harvest cannot be gathered. Emerson.

The poet bestrides the clouds, the wise man
looks up at them. Arliss.

The poet can never have far to seek for a subject;
for him the ideal world is not remote
from the actual, but under it and within it;
and he is a poet precisely because he can
discern it there. Carlyle.

The poet must believe in his poetry. The fault
of our popular poetry is that it is not sincere.

whispers of eternity, which coarser souls
must travel towards for scores of years before
their dull sense is touched by them. Holmes.

glance from heaven to earth, from earth to
heaven, / And, as imagination bodies forth /
The forms of things unknown, the poet's
pen / Turns them to shapes, and gives to
airy nothing / A local habitation and a name.
Mid. N.'s Dream, v. 1.

The poet's heart is an unlighted torch, which
gives no help to his footsteps till love has
touched it with flame. Lowell.

ours is that of aspiration; the former
stands fast on the soil of the present, the
latter hovers between memory and anticipation.
Schlegel.

The point is not that men should have a great
many books, but that they should have the
right ones, and that they should use those
that they have. John Morley.

death itself. Nathaniel Lee.

The poor are only they who feel poor. Emerson.

currents that issue from the remotest part,
and flow onwards into the remotest future.

and the infinite universe was not made for
one, but for all. Carlyle.

The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance
to all the forces of the crown. It may
be frail, the wind may blow through it, the
storm may enter, the rain may enter, but
the king of England cannot enter! all his
force dares not cross the threshold of that
ruined tenement. Chatham.

The popular ear weighs what you are, not
what you were. Quarles.

The popular man stands on our own level, or
a hairsbreadth higher; and shows us a truth
we can see without shifting our present
intellectual position. The original man
stands above us, and wishes to wrench us
from our old fixtures, and elevate us to a
higher and clearer level. Carlyle.

The population of the world is a conditional
population; not the best, but the best that
could live now. Emerson.

The post of honour is the post of difficulty,                       35

not overcome. Carlyle.

miserable, for the happy impute all their
success to prudence and merit. (?)

drawing lessons from it rarer, and that of
condensing the lesson in a pointed sentence
is rarest of all. John Morley.

The power, whether of painter or poet, to describe                  40
rightly what he calls an ideal thing
depends upon its being to him not an ideal
but a real thing. No man ever did or ever
will work well, but either from actual sight
or sight of faith. Ruskin.

The practice of faith and obedience to some of
our fellow-creatures is the alphabet by which
we learn the higher obedience to heaven;
and it is not only needful to the prosperity
of all noble united action, but essential to the
happiness of all noble living spirits. Ruskin.

The practice of submission to the authority of
one whom one recognises as greater than
one's self outweighs the chance of occasional
mistake. Froude.

us vain, but humble rather. J. M. Barrie.

than the wethers. Ger. Pr.

not know of, or believe in, any blessed
islands till it find them, it may be, in due
time. Ruskin.

Are scattered at the feet of man, like flowers.

mountain into the human at its base. C. H.

by shouldering, hugging, squeezing, smiling,
and bowing. Arbuthnott.

his crown. Mer. of Venice, iv. 1.

world a question of life or death, a question
on which depends the future. Renan.

The question of questions (for men and nations)

often misunderstood, is that it is the beautiful
nature of woman to veil her soul as her
charms. F. Schlegel.

The reason why we sometimes see that men
of the greatest capacities are not rich, is
either because they despise wealth in comparison

same time enjoy all the pleasures and gratifications
of life. Eustace Budgell.

passed away for ever. Ruskin.

The reputation of a man is like his shadow--gigantic
when it precedes him, and pigmy
in its proportions when it follows. Talleyrand.

The reputation of a woman is as a crystal                           15

and so both are devoured. Dutch Pr.

the thief. Othello, i. 3.

The romantic is the instinctive delight in, and
admiration for, sublimity, beauty, and virtue,
unusually manifested. Ruskin.

The root of almost every schism and heresy
from which the Christian Church has suffered
has been the effort of men to earn,
rather than to receive, their salvation; and
the reason that preaching is so commonly
ineffectual is, that it calls on men oftener to
work for God than to behold God working
for them. Ruskin.

The root of sanctity is sanity. A man must
be healthy before he can be holy. We bathe
first, and then perfume. Mme. Swetchine.

that the workmanship is the united effort of
pains, attention, and repeated trial. Burns.

The rough seas that spare not any man.
Pericles, ii. 1.

ruling passion, conquers reason still. Pope.

among men, is but evidence of a still sadder

Aldrich.

the harmony of the world. Hooker.

The second fruit of friendship is healthful and
sovereign for the understanding, as the first
is for the affections; for friendship maketh
indeed a fair day in the affections from storm
and tempests, but it maketh daylight in the

they will turn and rend you. Scott.

mind, but the flowers grow quickly. Bodenstedt.

The seeds of things are very small. George
Eliot.

The seers are wholly a greater race than the
thinkers; (yet) a true thinker, who has a
practical purpose in his thinking, and is
sincere, as Plato, or Carlyle, or Helps, becomes
in some sort a seer, and must be
always of infinite use in his generation.
Ruskin.

The sense of death is most in apprehension, /                       10

The sense of human dignity was the chief
moral agent of antiquity, and the sense of
sin of mediævalism. H. Lecky.

deaths. Carlyle.

does. Goethe.

The sentimental by and by will have to give
place to the practical. Carlyle.

account the sooner made, / The account soon
made, the merrier mind, / The merrier mind
doth thought evade. Sir T. Wyatt.

The shortest way to do many things is to do
only one thing at once. Samuel Smiles.

The showy lives its little hour; the true / To
after times bears rapture ever new. Goethe.

a whole day of snowflakes ... who does
not care for that? Private opinion is weak,

The slender vine twists around the sturdy                           45

because it has not strength sufficient to support
itself. Goldsmith.

The slight that can be conveyed in a glance,
in a gracious smile, in a wave of the hand,
is often the "ne plus ultra" of art. What
insult is so keen, or so keenly felt, as the
polite insult which it is impossible to resent?
Julia Kavanagh.

The slow wheel turns, / The cycles round
themselves and grow complete, / The world's
year whitens to the harvest-tide, / And one

manners. Goethe.

The soldier's trade, verily and essentially, is
not slaying, but being slain ... and the
reason the world honours the soldier is because
he holds his life at the service of the
state. Ruskin.

The soldier's ultimate and perennial office is
to punish knaves and make idle persons
work; the defence of his country against
other countries, which is his office at present,
will soon now be extinct. Ruskin.

The sole terms on which the past can become
ours are its subordination to the present.
Emerson.

The Son of man came not to be ministered

or of devils, be lost and ruined but by his
own only. Carlyle.

The soul of man is a mirror of the mind of God.                     20
Ruskin.

The soul reveals itself in the voice only.... It
is audible, not visible. Longfellow.

spirit. Jesus.

matter. Goethe.

The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak. Jesus of his disciples.

but a wounded spirit who can bear? Bible.

a lawgiver. Montesquieu.

The spirit of poesy is the morning light, which
makes the statue of Memnon sound. Novalis.

The spirit only can teach. Emerson.

The spirit was long ago liberated from the
blind law of nature, and the task it is called
to now is to unfold itself with freedom and
clearness in the sunlight, i.e., in its own light
now at length conscious of itself. Ed.

The spiritual artist too is born blind, and does                    40
not, like certain other creatures, receive
sight in nine days, but far later--perhaps
never. Carlyle.

The spiritual is ever the inner in a man becoming
outer, the invisible becoming visible,
the supernatural becoming natural, the infinite
becoming finite, and the eternal veiling
itself in the guise of time; never an
emancipation from the flesh, but ever an
incarnation in flesh. Ed.

The spiritual is higher than the external; the
spiritual cannot be externally authenticated.
Hegel.

The spiritual is the parent and first cause of
the practical. Carlyle.

The spiritual man is free to rule his world, not
his world to rule him. Ed.

The spiritual problem which Christ resolved                         45
was pretty much this--the derivation of that
from within man which was conceived to be
above man, by the reperception of the forgotten
truth that it was in His own image
God made man. He first opened up the well
within. Ed.

The spiritual universe is no more to be made
out of a man's own head than the material
universe or the moral universe.... No belief
of ours will change the facts or reverse
the laws of the spiritual universe. R. W.
Dale.

The spiritual will always body itself forth in
the temporal history of men; the spiritual is
the beginning of the temporal, always determines
the material. Carlyle.

The spiritual world is not closed; it is thy
sense that is: thy heart is dead. Goethe.

The spring can be apprehended only while it
is flowing. Goethe.

The springing of a serpent is from the sun;
the wisdom of the serpent, whence is that?
Ruskin.

The stars do not come to tell us it is night,                        5
but to lay beams of light through it, and
give the eye a path to walk in. Ward
Beecher.

The stars shall fade away, the sun himself /
Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in
years; / But thou shalt flourish in immortal
youth, / Unhurt amidst the war of elements, /
The wrecks of matter and the crash of
worlds. Addison.

The stars themselves are only bright by distance;
go close, and all is earthy; but vapours
illuminate there; from the breath and from
the countenance of God comes light on
worlds higher than they. Landor.

The "State in danger" is a condition of things
which we have witnessed a hundred times;
and as for the Church, it has seldom been
out of "danger" since we can remember it.

The State must follow, and not lead, the character
and progress of the citizen. Emerson.

find the rock beneath. Whittier.

The still, sad music of humanity. Wordsworth.

The Stoic thought by slandering Happiness to
woo her; by shunning to win her; and
proudly presumed that, by fleeing her, she
would turn and follow him. Arliss.

The Stoic was a proud man, and not a humble,
and he was content if he could only have his
own soul for a prey. He did not see that the
salvation of one man is impossible except in
the salvation of other men, and that no man
can save another unless he descend into that
other's case, and be, as it were, in that
other's stead. Ed.

The stoical exemption which philosophy affects                      15
to give us over the pains and vexations of
human life is as imaginary as the state of
mystical quietism and perfection aimed at by
some crazy enthusiast. Scott.

The stoical scheme of supplying our wants by
lopping off our desires is like cutting off our
feet when we want shoes. Swift.

The stomach has no ears. Pr.

The stone that lieth not in your way need
not offend you. Pr.

The stone which the builders refused has become
the head of the corner. Bible.

so. Taylor.

with disappointed hopes leaveth there his
own offences, and departeth, taking with
him all the good actions of the owner. Hitopadesa.

return! Goethe.

wholesome berries thrive and ripen best /
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality. Hen.
V., i. 1.

Pr.

The street is full of humiliations to the proud.                    25
Emerson.

The strength and power of a country depends
absolutely on the quantity of good men and
women in it. Ruskin.

The strength of aquatic animals is the waters;
of those who dwell in towns, a castle; of footsoldiers,
their own ground; of princes, an
obedient army. Hitopadesa.

The string o'erstretched breaks, and the music
flies; / The string o'erslack is dumb, and
music dies; / Tune us the sitar neither low
nor high. Sir Edwin Arnold.

The string that jars / When rudely touch'd,
ungrateful to the sense, / With pleasure feels
the master's flying fingers, / Swells into harmony
and charms the hearers. Rowe.

The stroke that comes transmitted through                           30
a whole galaxy of elastic balls, is it less
a stroke than if the last ball only had been
struck and sent flying? Carlyle.

The strokes of the pen need deliberation as
much as those of the sword need swiftness.
Julia W. Howe.

The strong man is the wise man; the man
with the gift of method, of faithfulness, of
valour; who has insight into what is what,
into what will follow out of what, the eye to
see and the hand to do. Carlyle.

The strong mind is nowise the mind acquainted
with its strength. Carlyle.

The strong must build stout cabins for the
weak; / Must plan and stint; must sow
and reap and store; / For grain takes root
though all seems bare and bleak. Eugene
Lee-Hamilton.

The strong thing is the just thing: this thou                       35
wilt find throughout in our world;--as indeed
was God and Truth the maker of it, or was
Satan and Falsehood? Carlyle.

The strong torrents, which in their own gladness
fill the hills with hollow thunder and
the vales with winding light, have yet their
bounden charge of field to feed and barge
to bear. Ruskin.

momentum to a feather. Schopenhauer.

The strongest castle, tower, and town, / The
golden bullet beats it down. Shakespeare.

The student is to read history actively and                         40
not passively; to esteem his own life the
text, and books the commentary. Thus
compelled, the muse of history will utter
oracles as never to those who do not respect
themselves. Emerson.

The study of books is a languishing and feeble
motion that hearts not, whereas conversation
teaches and exercises at once. Montaigne.

The stumbler stumbles least in rugged way.
George Herbert.

The style of an author is a faithful copy of his
mind. If you would write a lucid style, let
there first be light in your own mind; and if
you would write a grand style, you ought to
have a grand character. Goethe.

The style of letters should not be too highly
polished. It ought to be neat and correct,
but no more. Blair.

The style of writing required in the great
world is distinguished by a free and daring
grace, a careless security, a fine and sharp
polish, a delicate and perfect taste; while
that fitted for the people is characterised
by a vigorous natural fulness, a profound
depth of feeling, and an engaging naïveté.
Goethe.

The sublime is in a grain of dust. Landor.

The sublime is the temple-step of religion, as                       5
the stars are of immeasurable space. When
what is mighty appears in nature--a storm,
thunder, the starry firmament, death--then
utter the word "God" before the child. A
great misfortune, a great blessing, a great
crime, a noble action, are building-sites for
a child's church. Jean Paul.

The sublime produces a beautiful calmness in
the soul which, entirely possessed by it, feels
as great as it ever can feel. When we compare
such a feeling with that we are sensible
of when we laboriously harass ourselves with
some trifle, and strain every nerve to gain as
much as possible for it, as it were, to patch
it out, striving to furnish joy and aliment to
the mind from its own creation, we then feel
sensibly what a poor expedient, after all, the
latter is. Goethe.

The sublime, when it is introduced at a seasonable
moment, has often carried all before it
with the rapidity of lightning, and shown at
a glance the mighty power of genius. Longinus.

The sublimest canticle to be heard on earth is
the stammering of the human soul on the lips
of infancy. Victor Hugo.

The sublimity of wisdom is to do those things
living which are to be desired when dying.

The substance of a man is full good when sin is
not in a man's conscience. Chaucer.

The substantial wealth of a man consists in
the earth he cultivates with its plants and
animals, and in the rightly produced works
of his own hands. Ruskin.

The success of many works is found in the relation
between the mediocrity of the author's
ideas and that of the ideas of the public.
Chamfort.

The suffering man ought really "to consume
his own smoke;" there is no good in emitting
smoke till you have made it into fire. Carlyle.

The sufficiency of my merit is to know that my                      15
merit is not sufficient. St. Augustine.

The sun can be seen by nothing but its own
light. Pr.

The sun flings out impurities, gets balefully incrusted
with spots; but it does not quench
itself, and become no sun at all, but a mass
of darkness. Carlyle.

The sun! God's crest upon his azure shield, the
heavens. Bailey.

The sun is God. Turner on his deathbed.

The sun may do its duty, though your grapes                         20
are not ripe. Pr.

The sun passeth through pollutions, and itself
remains as pure as before. Bacon.

The sun-steeds of time, as if goaded by invisible
spirits, bear onward the light car of
our destiny, and nothing remains for us but,
with calm self-possession, to grasp the reins,
and now right, now left, to steer the wheels,
here from the precipice, and there from the
rock. Whither he is hasting, who knows?
Does any one consider whence he came?
Goethe.

The sun's power cannot draw a wandering star
from its path. How then could a human
being fall out of God's love! Rückert.

The sunshine of life is made up of very little
beams, that are bright all the time. Aikin.

The superstition in which we have grown up                          25
does not lose its hold over us even when we
recognise it for such. Those who scoff at
their fetters are not all free men. Lessing.

The sure way to miss success is to miss the
opportunity. Philarète Chasles.

succeed. Sheridan.

in pursuit of it. Goldsmith.

The surgeon practises on the orphan's head.
Arab. Pr.

The sweetest music is not in the oratorio, but
in the human voice when it speaks from its
instant life tones of tenderness, truth, or
courage. Emerson.

The sweetest wine makes the sharpest vinegar.
Pr.

The sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
Bible.

The sweets of love are washed with tears.                           35
George Herbert.

The sword is but a hideous flash in the darkness;
right is an eternal ray. Victor Hugo.

things and great are alike part of one mighty
whole. Ruskin.

winds, and ambitious men of the blasts of
fortune. Wm. Penn.

The tanager flies through the green foliage as
if he would ignite the leaves. Thoreau.

The teaching of art is the teaching of all things.
Ruskin.

The teachings of Heaven are given--by sad
law--in so obscure, nay, often in so ironical
a manner, that a blockhead necessarily reads
them wrong. Ruskin.

The tear of joy is a pearl of the first water;
the mourning tear, only of the second. Jean
Paul.

The tears of penitents are the wine of angels.                      45
St. Bernard.

The tell-tale out of school is of all wits the
greatest fool. Swift.

The temper of the pedagogue suits not with
the age; and the world, however it may be
taught, will not be tutored. Shaftesbury.

The temperate man's pleasures are durable,
because they are regular; and all his life is
calm and serene, because it is innocent. (?)

The tempest never rooteth up the grass, which
is feeble, humble, and shooteth not up on
high; but exerteth its power even to distress
the lofty trees; for the great use not their
might but upon the great. Hitopadesa.

The temple of our purest thoughts is--silence!                       5
Mrs. Hale.

diminish the amount of evil than to produce
an amount of happiness. Goethe.

the poetry of affairs, to fuse the circumstance

of nature and of God were intrusted
to none but men of noble minds! Goethe.

The There is never Here. Schiller.                                15

The thin edge of the wedge is to be feared. Pr.

The thing a lie wants, and solicits from all

dark with excess of bright"? Carlyle.

as the painter, clear, without direct sunshine,

to the Lord. Bible.

The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.

have seen, can be again called back before
the mind's eye and before the imagination;
but the heart is not so obliging; it
does not reproduce its pleasing emotions.

The universe is but one vast symbol of God;
nay, if thou wilt have it, what is man himself
but a symbol of God; is not all that he does

themselves, and will not suffer us to share.

by reality, and instead of thinking how
things may be, to see them as they are.

one of the most childish pieces of folly that
can be. Sir Matthew Hale.

proceeds from their being carefully
concealed. Goldsmith.

The very head and front of my offending /

The very nature of the dilettanti is that they                      30

something for which they have no capacity.
Goethe.

The very pain of loving is all other joys before.

book of life, its most charming chapter.
Goethe.

proof of God. Renan.

ears of love. Amiel.

the precepts of reason shows itself equally
great in avoiding as in overcoming dangers.

the frog is destitute of shelter. Hitopadesa.

The virtuous man, from his justice and the
affection he hath for mankind, is the dispeller
of sorrow and pain. Hitopadesa.

and dank vapour, can with difficulty be kindled,
and caused to raise its eyes heavenward.
Heraclitus.

The visible creation is the terminus or the
circumference of the invisible world. Emerson.

those at the first extremity will know all.

The voice of the people ought always to meet
with attention, though it does not always

do; the noble by what they are. Schiller.

The vulgar great are comprehended and
adored, because they are in reality on the
same moral plane with those who admire;

your misses. Pr.

never to do what we ought to be ashamed
of. Cic.

The way to be original is to be healthy.

Satan may be roasted in his own flames;
Tophet may be exploded with its own sulphur.
John Burroughs upon Carlyle's teaching.

The way to heaven is set with briars and

mind with rest, before his trunk with riches.

The ways in which most men get their living,
that is, live, are mere makeshifts, and a

they do not mean better. Thoreau.

thinking brain and the skilful hand. Dr.

The weariest and most loathéd worldly life, /                       45

Can lay on nature, is a paradise / To what
we fear of death. Meas. for Meas., iii. 1.

The wearisome is in permanence here. Carlyle
at Linlathen, in Forfarshire.

The weary night o' care and grief / May hae
a joyful morrow. Burns.

The web of this world is woven of necessity and
contingency; the reason of man places itself
between them, and knows how to rule them
both. It treats the necessary as the ground
of its existence; the contingent it knows how
to direct, lead, and utilise; and it is only
while reason stands firm and steadfast that
man deserves to be called the god of the
earth. Woe to him who has accustomed
himself from his youth to incline to find
something arbitrary in what is necessary,
who would fain ascribe a kind of reason to
the contingent, which it were even a religion
to follow; what is that but to disown one's
own understanding, and to give loose reins
to one's inclinations? We imagine it piety
to saunter along (hinschlendern) without consideration,
and to allow ourselves to be determined
by agreeable accidents, and finally
give to the results of such a vacillating life
the name of Divine guidance. Goethe.

The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good
and ill together; our virtues would be proud
if our faults whipped them not, and our
crimes would despair if they were not
cherished by our virtues. All's Well, iv. 3.

The wedge will rend rocks; but its edge must
be sharp and single; if it is double, the wedge
is bruised in pieces, and will rend nothing.

The wheel is always in motion, and the spoke
which is uppermost will soon be under;
therefore mix trembling with all your joy.
Philip Henry.

The whole art of war consists in getting at                          5
what is on the other side of the hill, or, in
other words, in learning what we do not
know from what we do. Duke of Wellington.

The whole course of things goes to teach us
faith. Emerson.

The whole difference between a man of genius
and other men ... is that the former remains
in great part a child, seeing with the large
eyes of children, in perpetual wonder, not
conscious of much knowledge--conscious
rather of infinite ignorance, and yet infinite
power. Ruskin.

The whole economy of nature is bent on expression.
Emerson.

The whole interest of history lies in the fortunes
of the poor. Emerson.

The whole function of the artist in the world is                    10
to be a seeing and a feeling creature; to be
an instrument of such tenderness and sensitiveness
that no shadow, no hue, no line, no
instantaneous and evanescent expression of
the visible things around him, nor any of the
emotions which they are capable of conveying
to the spirit which has been given him,
shall either be left unrecorded, or fade from
the book of record. Ruskin.

The whole man to one thing at a time.
Pr.

The whole of chivalry and of heraldry is in
courtesy. Emerson.

The whole past is the possession of the present.
Carlyle.

The whole spiritual universe exists only in
process--what Hegel calls "Der Process
des Geistes"--the process of the spirit, that
is to say, not as become, but as becoming;
and if it once ceases to become, it ceases as
such to be. Ed.

The whole universe is at all moments saying                         15
"Nay" to the Spirit of God, and God's
Spirit is at all moments saying "Yea" to
the stolid "Nay" of the universe, which
would fain be let alone; but stubborn as
the material looks and is, it has to obey,
and does obey, the voice of God. Ed.

The whole world is, properly speaking, a tragic
embarras. Rahel.

The whole world of truth and conscience is
nothing without I. Jean Paul.

The wide pasture is but separate spears of
grass; the sheeted bloom of the prairies but
isolated flowers. Ward Beecher.

The wife can carry more out of the house in
her apron than the man can bring in on a
harvest-waggon. Rückert.

Is always at home as if she were lame; /
And the mind that is honest, her chiefest
delight, / Is still to be doing from morning
till night. Sp. Pr.

The wisdom of life is in preventing all the evil
we can, and using what is inevitable to the
best purpose. Ruskin.

The wisdom of nations lies in their proverbs,

little; they save time in speaking; and upon
occasion may be the fullest and safest
answers. William Penn.

The wisdom of the wise and the experience of
ages may be preserved by quotation. Isaac
Disraeli.

The wise are instructed by reason, ordinary                         30

fools are only polite at home. Goldsmith.

to truth; the foolish are those who persist
in their error. Rückert.

creature larger than himself, some law holier
than himself. Ruskin.

the ignoramus thinks he knows. Sp. Pr.

should never fight; because victory, it is
observed, cannot be constant to both combatants.

standeth fast with the other. A man should
not quit one place until he hath fixed upon
another. Hitopadesa.

The wise man must go to the foolish, else
would his wisdom go for nought, since the
foolish never come to the wise. Bodenstedt.

The wise man often shuns society for fear of                        10
being bored. La Bruyère.

The wise man ought to despise glory, but not
honour. Honour is but seldom where glory
is, and glory almost more rarely still where
honour is. Seume.

The wise man should study the acquisition of
science and riches as if he were not subject
to sickness and death; but to the duties of
religion he should attend as if death had
seized him by the hair. Hitopadesa.

The wise man will commit no business of importance
to a proxy when he may do it
himself. L'Estrange.

fool. Emerson.

The wise weigh their words in a balance for
gold. Ecclus.

The wise will determine from the gravity of the
case; the irritable, from sensibility to oppression;

hands. Burke.

lo'ed the lasses O. Burns.

The wisest men are wise to the full in death.
Ruskin.

The wisest, most melodious voice cannot in                          25

shape of a poetic figure, from which the once
earnest, awful, and soul-subduing sense has
vanished without return. Carlyle.

The woman's cause is man's: they rise or
sink / Together. Tennyson.

The womankind will not drill. Carlyle, Father

The work of righteousness shall be peace.

every turn. Schopenhauer.

than by laws. Channing.

The world is governed too much. (?)                                 35

any observation on what passes around

sucker, or branch of the darling plant they
are rearing in their fancy. Burns.

The world is still deceived with ornament. /
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt, /
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice, /
Obscures the show of evil? In religion, /
What damnéd error but some sober brow /
Will bless it and approve it with a text, /
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

men; they make the earth wholesome.

"image of his own dream." Carlyle.

the evils arise which render us really unhappy.

the world of action, for if they once coincided

what they teach in song." Lord Houghton.

men ill at ease. Hawthorne.

have no history than to those who have;
and the silent noble ones, who have enriched
and exalted it by their mere presence, form
a much grander and greater host than those
do whose names stand emblazoned in written
story, and are the loud boast of all. Ed.

The world remains ever the same. Goethe.

The world seldom offers us any choice between
solitude on the one hand and vulgarity on
the other. Schopenhauer.

The world-spirit is a good swimmer, and storms
and waves cannot drown him. Emerson.

The world still wants its poet-priest, who shall
not trifle with Shakespeare, the player, nor
shall grope in graves with Swedenborg, the
mourner; but who shall see, speak, and
act with equal inspiration. Emerson.

The world that surrounds you is the magic                           15
glass of the world within you. To know
yourself you have only to set down a true
statement of those that ever loved or hated
you. Lavater.

The world throws its life into a hero or a
shepherd, and puts him where he is wanted.
Dante and Columbus were Italians in their
time; they would be Russians or Americans
to-day. Emerson.

The world truly exists only in the presence of
man, acts only in the passion of man. The

force in his soul--the pertinence of action in
his deeds. Ruskin.

is like to take six thousand to make out.
Sir Thomas Browne.

than a span. Bacon.

The world's a room of sickness, where each                          20
heart / Knows its own anguish and unrest! /
The truest wisdom there, and noblest art, /
Is his who skills of comfort best. Keble.

The world's a sea. Quarles.

The world's a wood, in which all lose their way, /
Though by a different path each goes astray.
Buckingham.

The world's battle-fields have been in the
heart chiefly. More heroism has there been
displayed in the household and in the closet,
I think, than on the most memorable military
battle-fields of history. Ward Beecher.

The world's great men have not commonly
been great scholars, nor its great scholars
great men. Holmes.

The world's wealth is its original men; by                          25
these and their works it is a world and not
a waste; the memory and record of what
Men it loves--this is the sum of its strength,
its sacred "property for ever," whereby it
upholds itself and steers forward, better or
worse, through the yet undiscovered deep
of Time. Carlyle.

The worse the man, the better the soldier; if

is better than the best which teaches everything
else, and not that. John Sterling.

Pope.

The worst of many is that their goodness is

to turn a wheel. Spurgeon.

The worst superstition is to consider our own
the most tolerable. Lessing.

The worst wheel in the waggon creaks the

The wretchedness which fate has rendered                            40
voiceless and tuneless is not the least
wretched, but the most. Carlyle.

The wrinkles of the heart are more indelible

day or that, but to all men in all times and
places? Carlyle.

The young disease, that must subdue at
length, / Grows with his growth, and
strengthens with his strength. Pope.

but in a more advanced state it grows
rigid, and must be warmed and softened
before it will receive a deep impression.
Joshua Reynolds.

The young talk generously of relieving the
old of their burdens, but the anxious heart
is to the old when they see a load on the back
of the young. J. M. Barrie.

is youth. Jean Paul.

his brethren, all to God; / Let the world
take us as she may, / We must not change
our road. Keble.

ye tak' a thought and men', / Ye aiblins (perhaps)
might--I dinna ken, / Still hae a stake;/
I'm wae to think upon yon den / E'en for
your sake. Burns.

Then gently scan your brother man, / Still
gentler sister woman; / Though they may
gang a kennin' wrang, / To step aside is
human. Burns.

Then in the strife the youth puts forth his
powers, / Knows what he is, and feels himself
a man. Goethe.

Then let us pray that come it may, / As come                        15
it will for a' that, / That sense an' worth,
o'er a' the earth, / May bear the gree and a'
that. Burns.

Then was I as a tree / Whose boughs did bend
with fruit; but, in one night, / A storm, or
robbery, call it what you will, / Shook down
my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves, / And
left me bare to weather. Cymbeline, iii. 3.

Theology is anthropology. Feuerbach.

Theoretical principles must sometimes be suffered
to give way for the sake of practical
advantages. Pitt.

Theories of genius are the peculiar constructions
of our philosophical times; ages of
genius have passed away, and they left no
other record than their works. I. Disraeli.

only is tangible. H. Ballou.

Theories which do not connect measures with
men are not theories for this world. Charles
Fox.

Theory and practice always act upon one
another. It is possible to construe from
what we do what we think, and from what
we think what we will do. Goethe.

so far as it proves to us the connection
(Zusammenhang) that subsists among the
phenomena. Goethe.

man, and which takes shape in moral commandments,

operate in the external universe. Froude.

above the force of words. A silent address
is the genuine eloquence of sincerity. Goldsmith.

the stationary, and the progressive.

much must be done. Johnson.

There are certain things in which mediocrity
is not to be endured, such as poetry, music,
painting, public speaking. La Bruyère.

There are certain times in our life when we find
ourselves in circumstances, that not only
press upon us, but seem to weigh us down
altogether. They give us, however, not
only the opportunity, but they impose on us
the duty of elevating ourselves, and thereby
fulfilling the purpose of the Divine Being in
our creation. Goethe.

There are charms made only for distant admiration.
No spectacle is nobler than a blaze.
Johnson.

There are cloudy days for the mind as well as                       35
for the world, and the man who has the most
genius is twenty times a day in the clouds.
Beaumelle.

than hell. Platen.

There are enough unhappy on this earth.
Tennyson.

There are faces so fluid with expression that
we can hardly find what the mere features
are. Emerson.

which is the case in parables, fables, &c....

speak the truth is violated, because none
was given. Paley.

reduce to an acknowledgment of the Divine
power. Plato.

There are few persons to whom truth is not a
sort of insult. Ségur.

There are few things that are worthy of anger,
and still fewer that can justify malignity.
Johnson.

There are few thoughts likely to come across
ordinary men which have not already been
expressed by greater men in the best possible
way; and it is a wiser, more generous,
more noble thing to remember and point out
the perfect words than to invent poorer ones,
wherewith to encumber temporarily the
world. Ruskin.

There are few who, either by extraordinary
endowment or favour of fortune, have enjoyed
the opportunity of deciding what mode of
life in especial they would wish to embrace.
Cic.

There are few wild beasts more to be dreaded
than a communicative man having nothing
to communicate. Bovee.

There are fewer students of man than of
geometry. Pascal.

There are forty men of wit for one of sense;                         5

ready change. (?)

long that there is no wit for so much room.
Fuller.

There are in man, in the beginning / And at
the end, two blank book-binder's leaves--childhood
and age. Jean Paul.

There are in the history of a man only three
epochs, his birth, his life, and his death; he
is not conscious of being born; he submits to
die; and he forgets to live. La Bruyère.

There are in this day, as in all days, around
and in every man, voices from the gods,
imperative to all, if obeyed by even none,
which say audibly: Arise, thou son of Adam,
son of Time, make this thing more divine,
and that thing, and thyself of all things, and
work, and sleep not; for the Night cometh
wherein no man can work. Carlyle.

There are in this loud stunning tide / Of                           10
human care and crime, / With whom the
melodies abide / Of th' everlasting chime; /
Who carry music in their heart, / Through
dusty lane and wrangling mart, / Plying
their daily task with busier feet, / Because
their secret souls a holy strain repeat.
Keble.

There are interests by the sacrifice of which
peace is too dearly purchased. One should
never be at peace to the shame of his own
soul, to the violation of his integrity or of his
allegiance to God. Chapin.

Beecher.

one morality. Ruskin.

experience has brought it home. J. S.
Mill.

than those of women, but no man
possesses the eloquence of a woman's eye.
C. Weber.

There are moments in life when the heart is
so full of emotion, / That if by chance it be
shaken, or into its depths like a pebble /
Drops some careless word, it overflows;
and its secret, / Spilt on the ground like
water, can never be gathered together.
Longfellow.

There are more fools than wise men, and even                        20
in the wise men more folly than wisdom.
Chamfort.

There are two, and only two, forms of possible
gospel or "good message"--one, that men
are saved by themselves doing what is
right; and the other, that they are saved
by believing that somebody also did right
instead of them. The first of these gospels
is eternally true and holy; the other eternally
false, damnable, and damning. Ruskin.

There are two kinds of genius. The first and                        35

its age, and tells it what it wishes to
be told. Lowell.

when he that is the least educated
will chiefly have to say that he is the least
perverted; and with the multitude of false
eye-glasses, convex, concave, green, even
yellow, has not lost the natural use of his
eyes. Carlyle.

There are very few moments in a man's existence                      5
when he experiences so much ludicrous
distress, or meets with so little charitable
commiseration, as when he is in pursuit of
his own hat. Dickens.

any good by either writing or reading. Ruskin.

store of wit, / Yet want as much again to
manage it; / For wit and judgment ever are

the best actions, for they contain the germ
of them all. Mme. Swetchine.

from those who have themselves learned to
obey. W. E. Forster.

Thomas à Kempis.

There coils a fear beneath the loveliest dream.
T. Watts.

as is common to man. St. Paul.

and of man; the one born of the Spirit, and
obeying it; the other born of the flesh, and
obeying it. Ruskin.

There in others' looks discover / What thy
own life's course has been, / And thy deeds
of years past over, / In thy fellow-men be
seen. Goethe.

There is a better thing than the great man                          20
who is always speaking, and that is the great
man who only speaks when he has a great
word to say. W. Winter.

There is a black speck, say the Arabs, were it
no bigger than a bean's eye, in every soul;
which, once set a-working, will overcloud the
whole man into darkness and quasi-madness,
and hurry him balefully into night. Carlyle.

There is a book, who runs may read, / Which
heavenly truth imparts, / And all the love its
scholars need, / Pure eyes and Christian
hearts. / The works of God above, below, /
Within us, and around, / Are pages in that
book, to show / How God Himself is found.
Keble.

There is a budding morrow in midnight. Keats.

There is a care for trifles which proceeds from
love and conscience, and is most holy; and
a care for trifles which comes of idleness and
frivolity, and is most base. And so, also,
there is a gravity proceeding from thought,
which is most noble; and a gravity proceeding
from dulness and mere incapability of
enjoyment, which is most base. Ruskin.

There is a Cato in every man; a severe censor                       25
of his manners. And he that reverences this
judge will seldom do anything he need repent
of. Burton.

There is a certain artificial polish, a commonplace
vivacity, acquired by perpetually mingling
in the beau monde, which, in the commerce
of the world, supplies the place of
natural suavity and good-humour; but it is
purchased at the expense of all original
and sterling traits of character. Washington
Irving.

body and all its parts, both in acting and
speaking, which argues a man well within.

heroic courage. St. Evremond.

And weak beginnings, lie intreasurèd.                                 2

While virtuous actions are but born and die.

strictly observed, it ceases to be virtue. (?)

are the channels of its communication.

man has but he whose eye can integrate
all the parts--that is, the poet. Emerson.

for their follies. Sir Thomas Browne.

There is a remedy for everything but death.
Cervantes.

There is a remedy for every wrong, and a
satisfaction for every soul. Emerson.

tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming
grief, of deep contrition, and of
unspeakable love. Washington Irving.

There is a skeleton in every house. Pr.

Then is a snake in the grass. Pr.

sparrow. Ham., v. 1.

taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; /

our ventures. Jul. Cæs., iv. 3.

receptive human spirit, a spirit standing before.
C. H. Parkhurst.

There is an abasement because of glory, and

felicitous application of an passage as in
being the author of it. St. Evremond.

There is, at any given moment, a best path
for every man; the thing which, here and

whatsoever hinders him, were it tremendous
cheers and rivers of heavy wet, is slavery.

hand on a human body. Novalis.

he can do without happiness,
and instead thereof find blessedness! Carlyle.

There is in nature an accessible and an inaccessible.

off. He who knows it, and is wise, will confine
himself to the accessible. Goethe.

man must be up and doing, and that all

may, into men's minds, that to live is nothing

but in solitary places, and out of the glowing
intelligence which He gave to men of old.

There is no mortal extant, out of the depths of
Bedlam, but lives all skinned, thatched,
covered over with formulas; and is, as it

science. Goethe.

There is no such flatterer as is a man's self,
and there is no such remedy against flattery
of a man's self as the liberty of a friend.
Lord Bacon.

is that he should be articulate. Stedman.

without a thorough good-humour, a natural
sweetness of temper, enlivened by cheerfulness.
Lady Montagu.

There is no such thing as chance; and what
seems to us merest accident springs from
the deepest source of destiny. Schiller.

There is no such thing as Liberty in the universe:                  30
there can never be. The stars have

not; and we men have the mockery and
semblance of it only for our heaviest punishment.

slavery of wisdom to folly. Carlyle.

There is, properly speaking, no misfortune in                       25

after overcoming this obstruction, but bursts
forth with the greater force. Novalis.

There is really something absurd about the

in our age, and yet every fool thinks himself
justified in criticising persons. Bulwer
Lytton.

There is sentiment in all women, and sentiment                      30
gives delicacy to thought, and tact to
manner. But sentiment with men is generally
acquired, an offspring of the intellectual
quality, not, as with the other sex, of the
moral. Bulwer Lytton.

There is so much of good among the worst, so
much of evil in the best, such seeming partialities
in providence, so many things to
lessen and expand, yea, and with all man's
boast, so little real freedom of his will, that
to look a little lower than the surface, garb,
or dialect, or fashion, thou shalt feebly pronounce
for a saint, and faintly condemn for a
sinner. Tupper.

There is so much trouble in coming into the
world, and so much more, as well as meanness,

while to be here at all. Lord Bolingbroke.

There is some soul of goodness in things evil, /
Would men observingly distil it out. Henry
V., iv. 1.

There is some use in having two attorneys in
one firm. Their movements resemble those

bolts the operative brother to pin like a
bull-dog. Scott.

than the king himself. Chatham.

image of weeping beauty. Steele.

There is something too dear in the hope of
seeing again.... "Dear heart, be quiet;"
we say; "you will not be long separated
from those people that you love; be quiet,
dear heart!" And then we give it in the
meanwhile a shadow, so that it has something,
and then it is good and quiet, like
a little child whose mother gives it a doll
instead of the apple which it ought not to
eat. Goethe.

There is still a real magic in the action and
reaction of minds on one another. The
casual deliration of a few becomes, by this
mysterious reverberation, the frenzy of
many; men lose the use, not only of their
understandings, but of their bodily senses;
while the most obdurate unbelieving hearts
melt like the rest in the furnace where all
are cast as victims and as fuel. Carlyle.

There is still enough to satisfy one in spite of
all misfortunes. Goethe.

There is such a choice of difficulties that I am
myself at a loss how to determine. J. Wolfe

a little more silent than we are. Carlyle.

more curse; in the meantime you must be
humble and honest enough to take your
share of it. Ruskin.

new modes than in adhering to the old ones.
It is true that the foolish invent them, but
the wise may conform to, instead of contradicting,
them. Joubert.

There must always remain something that is
antagonistic to good. Plato.

There must be a man behind a book. Emerson.

There must be hearts which know the depths
of our being, and swear by us, even when
the whole world forsakes us. Gutzkow.

There must be work done by the arms, or none
of us would live; and work done by the
brains, or the life would not be worth having.
And the same men cannot do both. Ruskin.

There must first be seducing men before                             15
seduced women. Jean Paul.

There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the
grave / To tell us this. Ham., i. 5.

which the most ignorant was not the most
violent. Pope.

in the breasts of men as now. Emerson.

There occur cases in human life when it is
wisdom not to be too wise. Schiller.

There remaineth a rest to the people of God.

fewer hands than that of discerning when to
have done. Swift.

There the wicked cease from troubling, and                          30
there the weary be at rest. Bible.

There was a little city, and few men within it;
and there came a great king against it, and
besieged it, and built bulwarks against it.

and he by his wisdom delivered the city, yet no
man remembered that same poor man. Bible.

There was a time when meadow, grove, and
stream, / The earth and every common
sight, / To me did seem / Apparelled in
celestial light, / The glory and the freshness
of a dream. / It is not now as it has been of
yore; / Turn wheresoe'er I may, / By night
or day, / The things which I have seen, I
now can see no more. Wordsworth.

There was a time when the world acted upon
books. Now books act upon the world.
Joubert.

Israel that entered Jordan. Ward Beecher.

fed the soul of Love with tears. Tennyson.

thinking he has made the property of his
mind. Pestalozzi.

ground. Sp. Pr.

Bacon.

shade. John Quincy Adams.

our neighbour for God. Sir Thomas Browne.

has little to do with the worth or unworth of
a book. Carlyle.

deeply considered, and speedily reformed,
then is the utmost bound of civil liberty attained
that wise men look for. Milton.

well as of vital religion, that the soul shall
find a true centre out from and above itself,

This is the humour of it. Henry V., ii. 1.                        45

This is the monstrosity in love--that the will is
infinite, and the execution confined; that the
desire is boundless, and the act a slave to
limit. Troil. and Cress., iii. 2.

This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth /
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow
blossoms, / And bears his blushing honours
thick upon him; / The third day comes a
frost, a killing frost; / And when he thinks,
good easy man, full surely / His greatness
is a-ripening, nips his root, / And then he
falls, as I do. Hen. VIII., iii. 2.

bodiless creation ecstasy / Is very cunning

will aid if men will call; / For the blue sky
bends over all. Coleridge.

This so solid-seeming world is, after all, but an
air-image, our Me the only reality; and
Nature, with its thousand-fold production
and destruction, but the reflex of our own
inward force, the "Phantasy of our Dream,"
or, what the earth-spirit in "Faust" names
it, "the living visible garment of God."
Carlyle.

up alone, but must also break his looking-glass.
Boileau.

This world surely is wide enough to hold both

despised. La Roche.

Those only obtain love, for the most part, who
seek it not. Goethe.

Those only who know little can be said to

want tempters to urge them on. Tillotson.

Those who are elevated enough in life to reason                     50
and to reflect, yet low enough to keep clear
of the venal contagion of a court--these are
a nation's strength! Burns.

Those who are quite satisfied sit still and do
nothing; those who are not quite satisfied
are the sole benefactors of the world. Landor.

Those who attempt to level never equalise;
they load the edifice of society by setting
up in the air what the solidity of the structure
requires to be on the ground. Burke.

follies, begin at the wrong end, since the
attempt naturally presupposes us capable of

Pr.

Those who dwell in fear dwell next door to
hate; and I think it is the cowardice of
women that makes them such intense haters.

be honoured than they who produce them;
for these only gave them life, those the art
of living well. Arist.

Those who first study fate, and say, Fate is
the only cause of fortune and misfortune,
terrify themselves. Hitopadesa.

Those who give the first shock to a state are                       10
naturally the first to be overwhelmed in its
ruin. The fruits of public commotion are
seldom enjoyed by the man who was the first
to set it a-going; he only troubles the waters
for another's net. Montaigne.

Those who have even studied good books may
still be fools. Hitopadesa.

Those who injure one party to benefit another
are quite as unjust as if they converted the

happiness in this world must not complain if
happiness be not their portion. Froude.

Those who set their minds to deny things, and                       20
are fond of pulling things to pieces, must be
treated like deniers-of-motion; one need only
keep incessantly walking up and down before
them in as composed a manner as possible.
Goethe.

Those who trust us educate us. George Eliot.

Those who will not be ruled by the rudder
must be ruled by the rock. Cornish Pr.

Those who would make us feel must feel themselves.

ever lived in the tide of times. Jul. Cæs.,
iii. 1.

fulfil, / A noiseless revelation in the sky.

to my soul, / If sympathy of love unite
our thoughts. 2 Hen. VI., i. 1.

have not the gift thou hast. From this imperfection
springs sociability. Gellert.

Thou little thinkest what a little foolery
governs the world. John Selden.

Thou mayest as well expect to grow stronger
by always eating, as wiser by always reading.

thou writest a letter than when thou speakest
in presence. Fuller.

every one, which every hour is singing to us
all our life long. Goethe.

My services are bound. King Lear, i. 2.

Thou of an independent mind, / With soul
resolved, with soul resigned; / Prepared

wilt not be, nor have a slave; / Virtue alone
who dost revere, / Thy own reproach alone
dost fear, / Approach this shrine (Independence),
and worship here. Burns.

Thou shall hear no more complaints from me;

meat. Rom. and Jul., iii. 1.

Time wasted is existence; used, is life.

intrinsic merit, and not the slender helps of
the title. Goldsmith.

Titles of honour add not to his worth who is
himself an honour to his title. John Ford.

no personal merit are at best but the royal

as if he had never to die. Vauvenargues.

or of life. Goethe.

To act is easy, to think is hard; to act
according to our thought is troublesome.

God's. Cowley.

To be a philosopher is not merely to have
subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school,

people. Junius.

watery sentimentalism. Schopenhauer.

affection, the noblest and the best that a
mortal can be. Wieland.

To be angry is to avenge the faults of others

self. Arist.

that sent thee, the affliction will not be very

Of being independent. Burns.

and scoundrelism of them it has not even
a chance to do. Carlyle.

morals; and to have a deference for others
governs our manners. Sterne.

man. Goethe.

like a rusty mail, / In monumental mockery.

be in sorrow. Johnson.

winds and in the seas, / To have known him
in the circling of the suns, / And in the
changeful fates and lives of men. Lewis
Morris.

is to weave them into garlands. Mme.
Swetchine.

To have neither superior, nor inferior, nor                         10
equal, united manlike to you; without father,
without child, without brother,--man knows
no sadder destiny. Carlyle.

To have no assistance from other minds in
resolving doubts, in appeasing scruples, in
balancing deliberations, is a very wretched
destitution. Johnson.

To have no pain, and not be bored, is the
utmost happiness possible to man on earth.

poet, to have beheld or heard the greatest
works of any great painter or musician, is
a possession added to the best things of life.
Swinburne.

To have religion upon authority, and not upon
conviction, is like a finger-watch, to be set
forwards or backwards, as he pleases that
has it in keeping. William Penn.

To have the fear of God before our eyes, and,                       15
in our mutual dealings with each other, to
govern our actions by the eternal measures
of right and wrong; the first of these will
comprehend the duties of religion; the
second, those of morality. Sterne.

To have the gift of life and bread to sustain it
with can never suffice as a substitute for the
ministry and service which the life itself is
given us that we may fulfil. To find and
work out this is man's only satisfaction and
true reward. Ed.

To hear complaints is wearisome alike to the
wretched and the happy. Johnson.

To Him no high, no low, no great, no small; /
He fills, He bounds, connects and equals all.

To holy tears, / In lonely hours, Christ risen
appears; / In social hours, who Christ would
see / Must turn all tasks to charity. Keble.

intolerable, so that even the most ugly living
face is more engaging. Schopenhauer.

and catch the good that is within our reach,
is the great art of life. Johnson.

To judge by the event is an error all abuse                         25
and all commit; for in every instance, courage,
if crowned with success, is heroism; if
clouded by defeat, temerity. Colton.

To judge is to see clearly, to care for what is
just. Amiel.

To keep the wolf from the door. Pr.

To know a man, observe how he wins his
object, rather than how he loses it; for
when we fail, our pride supports us,--when
we succeed, it betrays us. Colton.

to retain in the memory what is entrusted
to it. Montaigne.

To know evil of others and not speak it, is                         30

others upon knowledge, but he can never
be good himself who speaks evil of others
upon suspicion. Arthur Warwick.

life, / Is the prime wisdom. Milton.

To know the divine laws and inner harmonies                         40
of this universe must always be the highest
glory for a man; and not to know them
always the highest disgrace for a man,
however common it be. Carlyle.

To know the true opinions of men, one ought
to pay more respect to their actions than
their words. Descartes.

phrase / For visits, ombre, balls, and plays.

beggars. Cymbeline, iii. 6.

To look at things as well as we can, to inscribe
them in our memory, to be observant, and
let no day pass without gathering something;
then to apply one's self to those
branches of knowledge which give the mind
a sure direction, to apportion everything its
place, to assign to everything its value (in
my opinion a genuine philosophy and a fundamental
mathesis), this is what we have
now to do. Goethe.

very happy or very unhappy. Revery is the
child of extreme. Rivarol.

To love and to be loved is the greatest happiness

love is to be useful to others. Béranger.

wife, / That's the true pathos and sublime /
O' human life. Burns.

To make a boy despise his mother's care is the
straightest way to make him also despise his
Redeemer's voice; and to make him scorn his
father and his father's house, the straightest
way to make him deny his God and his God's
heaven. Ruskin.

of the greatest and commonest of human
follies. Schopenhauer.

every one. Goethe.

a revelation, is the test of genius. Lowell.

is given, / When tost by tides of human
fate, / To anchor fast in heaven. Watts.

To me more dear, congenial to my heart, / One                       25
native charm, than all the gloss of art.

can no longer sustain my spirit. Goethe.

give / Thoughts that do often lie too deep for
tears. Wordsworth.

us from helping ourselves. Jarno, in Goethe's

myself, the action, and the author. Bp.
Hall.

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, /                           30
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, /
To the last syllable of recorded time; / And
all our yesterdays have lighted fools / To
dusty death. Macb., v. 5.

To-morrow is a satire on to-day, and shows its
weakness. Young.

itself's too late; the wise lived yesterday.

what far country does this morrow lie?

lights of a ship, which illumine only the
track it has passed. Coleridge.

Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
Othello, i. 3.

kingdoms of this world, and say: It is thine;

that is thine while thou canst keep it; nestle
thyself there, and bless Heaven! Carlyle.

evil by evil is evil. Mahomet.

To pass through a bustling crowd with its restless                  45

great a crowd and bustle one feels himself
perfectly calm and solitary. Goethe.

course / Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly
grief: / It shows a will most incorrect
to heaven. Ham., i. 2.

the best answer to calumny. Washington.

To place wit before good sense is to place the
superfluous before the necessary. M. de

To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my
father bred me early, / For one, he said, to
labour bred, was a match for fortune fairly.
Burns.

To popular religion, the real kingdom of God
is the New Jerusalem with its jaspers and
emeralds; righteousness and peace and joy
are only the kingdom of God figuratively.

upon just reasons, requires faculties which

to enjoy. Delille.

is to prove or doubt the existence of existence.
Jean Paul.

To put the cart before the horse. Pr.

well as in the esteem of the stronger, is the
first step from barbarism to civilisation.
Canning.

To read without reflecting is like eating without
digesting. Burke.

To receive a simple primitive phenomenon, to

superior natures. Goethe.

To reconcile despotism with freedom is to make
your despotism just. Carlyle.

To reform a world, to reform a nation, no wise                      15

slower, reformation, is what each man begins
and perfects on himself. Carlyle.

Better to reign in hell than serve in heav'n.

away / From this world's ills, that at the
very worst / Will soon blow o'er. Blair.

To say of a man "He means well," is worth
nothing except he does well. Plaut.

To say that we have a clear conscience is to                        25
utter a solecism; had we never sinned, we
would have had no conscience. Carlyle.

To scorn delights and live laborious days.
Milton.

To secure and promote the feeling of cheerfulness
should be the supreme aim of all our

hour. Wm. Blake.

than happiness, though it be with wounded

it, according to rules laid down. Carlyle.

To shoot wide of the mark, i.e., guess foolishly                  40
when you don't know. Pr.

To show mercy is nothing--thy soul must be
full of mercy; to be pure in act is nothing--thou
shalt be pure in heart also. Ruskin.

know why; / To sport an hour with beauty's
charm, / Then throw it idly by. Moore.

clever man. Cato.

charm of talking. Hare.

To taste of human flesh is less criminal in the
eyes of God than to stifle human thought.
Draper.

To tax the community for the advantage of a
class is not protection; it is plunder, and I
disclaim it. Disraeli.

To tell our own secrets is generally folly, but
that folly is without guilt; to communicate
those with which we are intrusted is always
treachery, and treachery for the most part
combined with folly. Johnson.

To the minnow every cranny and pebble, and                          10
quality and accident, of its little native creek
may have become familiar; but does the minnow
understand the ocean tides and periodic
currents, the trade-winds, and monsoons, and
moon's eclipses; by all of which the condition
of its little creek is regulated, and may (from
time to time, unmiraculously enough) be quite
overset and reversed? Such a minnow is
man; his creek, this planet earth; his ocean,
the immeasurable All; his monsoons and
periodic currents, the mysterious course of
Providence through æons of æons. Carlyle.

of his wretchedness that he is conscious of
virtue, that he feels himself the victim not of
suffering only, but of injustice. Carlyle.

To the vulgar eye few things are wonderful

to believe that the man, the mere man whom
they see, may perhaps painfully feel, toiling
at their side through the poor jostlings of
existence, can be made of finer clay than
themselves. Carlyle.

To the wisest man, wide as is his vision, Nature
remains of quite infinite depth, of quite infinite
expansion; and all experience thereof
limits itself to some few computed centuries
and measured square miles. Carlyle.

To the "Worship of sorrow" (Goethe's definition
of Christianity) ascribe what origin and
genesis thou pleasest, has not that worship
originated and been generated? Is it not
here? Feel it in thy heart, and then say
whether it is of God! Carlyle.

To those to whom we owe affection, let us be                        25
dumb until we are strong, though we should
never be strong. Emerson.

was a blessing becometh an evil. Hitopadesa.

in them, and then have come out of them.
Amiel.

To unpractised eyes, a Peak of Teneriffe, nay,
a Strasburg Minster, when we stand on it,
may seem higher than a Chimborazo; because
the former rise abruptly, without
abutement or environment; the latter rises
gradually, carrying half a world along with
it; and only the deeper azure of the heavens,
the widened horizon, the "eternal sunshine,"
disclose to the geographer that the "region
of change" lies far below. Carlyle.

To use books rightly is to go to them for help.
Ruskin.

To use studies too much for ornament is
affectation. Bacon.

To vice, innocence must always seem only a
superior kind of chicanery. Ouida.

To wail friends lost / Is not by much so wholesome,                 40
profitable, / As to rejoice at friends
but newly found. Love's L. Lost, v. 2.

To wed unequally is to suffer equally. Anon.

To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
Ham., v. 1.

To what excesses men go for a religion of
whose truth they are so little persuaded, and
to whose precepts they pay so little regard.

George Herbert.

To whom is the mere glare of the fire a virtue?
Hitopadesa.

To wilful men / The injuries that they themselves
procure / Must be their schoolmasters.

Too austere a philosophy makes few wise men;                        30
too rigorous politics, few good subjects; and
too hard a religion, few religious persons
whose devotion is of long continuance. St.
Evremond.

as it were, the playful teasing fondness

True humour springs not more from the head                          10
than from the heart; it is not contempt, its
essence is love; it issues not in laughter, but

were, into our affections what is below us,
while sublimity draws down into our affections
what is above us. Carlyle.

and does not complain. You may know it
by that. Varnhagen von Ense.

criminal; false modesty everything that is
unfashionable. Addison.

True morality scorns morality; that is, the                         25

redress, and builds her grandeur on the
public good. James Miller.

True religion is the poetry of the heart; it has
enchantments useful to our manners; it

under us, to recognise humility and poverty,

broken for sin, and broken from sin. Thornton.

True repentance is to cease from sin. St.                         35
Ambrose.

True sense and reason reach their aim / With
little help from art or rule. / Be earnest!
Then what need to seek / The words that
best your meaning speak? Goethe.

cloudy fancy; and a hundred acres of solid
earth are far more valuable than a million

wounded, writhes with pain, / And dies

true. Johnson.

Truth hath always a fast bottom. Pr.

of apostasy!" Carlyle.

Truth in its own essence cannot be / But good.

to examine whether that on which we differ

useful only for turnip-manure. Carlyle.

Under the weight of his knowledge, a man
cannot move so lightly as in the days of his
simplicity. Ruskin.

Under white ashes there often lurk glowing

give / To more virtue than doth live.
Jonson, on Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland.

And he wants wit that wants resolvèd will, /

better. Two Gent. of Verona, ii. 6.

satisfies desires, it simplifies needs, it foresees
the wishes of the imagination; it is an

that one. Jean Paul.

Universal plodding prisons up / The nimble
spirits in the arteries, / As motion and long-during
action tires / The sinewy vigour of
the traveller. Love's L. Lost, iv. 3.

Universus mundus exercet histrioniam--All
the world practises the player's art.

Unjust acquisition is like a barbed arrow,                          40
which must be drawn backward with horrible
anguish, or else will be your destruction.
Jeremy Taylor.

it is the wisest way for the advocates
of truth to give them full light. Whately.

Unless we are accustomed to them from early
youth, splendid chambers and elegant furniture
are for people who neither have nor can
have any thoughts. Goethe.

Unless we can cast off the prejudices of the
man and become as children, docile and unperverted,
we need never hope to enter the
temple of philosophy. Sir Wm. Hamilton.

Unless we place our religion and our treasure
in the same thing, religion will always be
sacrificed. Epictetus.

Unless we see our object, how shall we know                          5
how to place or prize it in our understanding,
our imagination, our affections? Carlyle.

Unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised; /

may learn. Mer. of Venice, iii. 2.

Unlike my subject now shall be my song; / It
shall be witty, but it shan't be long. Chesterfield.

Unlike the sun, intellectual luminaries shine
brightest after they set. Colton.

Unmarried men are best friends, best masters,
best servants, but not always best subjects;
for they are light to run away, and
almost all fugitives are of that condition.
Bacon.

Unmingled good cannot be expected; but as                           10
we may lawfully gather all the good within
our reach, we may be allowed to lament over
that which we lose. Johnson.

Unmingled joys to no one here befall; / Who
least, hath some; who most, hath never all.
Coleridge.

Unmöglich ist's, was Edle nicht vermögen--That

Unnatural deeds / Do breed unnatural troubles:
infected minds / To their deaf pillows will discharge
their secrets. Macb., v. 1.

Unpublished nature will have its whole secret                       20
told. Emerson.

Unreasonable haste is the direct road to error.
Molière.

Unreflective minds possess thoughts only as a
jug does water, by containing them. In a
disciplined mind knowledge exists like vital
force in the physical frame, ready to be
directed to tongue, or hand, or foot, hither,
thither, anywhere, and for any use desired.
Coley.

Unseasonable mirth always turns to sorrow.
Cervantes.

Unselfish and noble acts are the most radiant
epochs in the biography of souls. When

des Kranken für die Gesundheit--Our
feeling for nature is like the sensation of an invalid
for health. Schiller.

Unsociable tempers are contracted in solitude,
which will in the end not fail of corrupting
the understanding as well as the manners,
and of utterly disqualifying a man for the
satisfactions and duties of life. Men must
be taken as they are, and we neither make
them nor ourselves better by flying from or
quarrelling with them. Burke.

Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel. Bible.

Unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil; /
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear.

is the destiny of the poetic art.
Feuchtersleben.

Unter allen Völkerschaften haben die Griechen
den Traum des Lebens am schönsten geträumt--Of
all peoples the Greek has dreamt
most enchantingly the dream of life. Goethe.

Unter mancherlei wunderlichen Albernheiten
der Schulen kommt mir keine so vollkommen
lächerlich vor, als der Streit über die
Aechtheit alter Schriften, alter Werke. Ist
es denn der Autor oder die Schrift die wir
bewundern oder tadeln? es ist immer nur
der Autor, den wir vor uns haben; was
kümmern uns die Namen, wenn wir ein
Geisteswerk auslegen?--Among the manifold
strange follies of the schools, I know no one so
utterly ridiculous and absurd as the controversy
about the authenticity of old writings, old works.
Is it the author or the writing we admire or
censure? It is always the author we have before
us. What have we to do with names, when it is
a work of the spirit we are interpreting? Goethe.

Unthinking, idle, wild, and young, / I laughed,
and danced, and talked, and sung. Princess
Amelia.

Until men have learned industry, economy, and                       35
self-control, they cannot be safely intrusted
with wealth. Gladstone.

affairs as they do themselves, it is not very
safe to laugh at them or to find fault with

he seemeth to have. Jesus.

ever at the doors. Tennyson.

Unto the pure all things are pure. St. Paul.

Unto the youth should be shown the worth of                         40
a noble and ripened age, and unto the old
man, youth; that both may rejoice in the
eternal circle, and life may in life be made
perfect. Goethe.

Unwilling service earns no thanks. Dan. Pr.                       10

Unwise work, if it but persist, is everywhere
struggling towards correction and restoration
to health; for it is still in contact with
Nature, and all Nature incessantly contradicts
it, and will heal it or annihilate it; not
so with unwise talk, which addresses itself,
regardless of veridical Nature, to the universal
suffrages; and can, if it be dexterous,
find harbour there, till all the suffrages are
bankrupt and gone to Houndsditch. Carlyle.

Unworthy offspring brag most of their worthy
descent. Dan. Pr.

Uom, se' tu grande o vil? Muori, e il saprai--Man,
whether thou be great or vile, die, and it

Up from unfeeling mould, / To seraphs burning                       15
round the Almighty's throne, / Life rising
still on life, in higher tone, / Perfection forms,
and with perfection bliss. Thomson.

Up! up! my friend, and quit your books, / Or
surely you'll grow double. / Up! up! my
friend, and clear your looks, / Why all this
toil and trouble? Wordsworth.

Upbraiding turns a benefit into an injury. Pr.

Upon every occasion, be sure to make a conscience
of what you do or say. Thomas à

found a city of brick, and left it one of
marble. Suet. of the Rome of Cæsar Augustus.

invenerit--A city for sale and ripe for
ruin, once it finds a purchaser. Sall. of Rome.

Urbes constituit ætas: hora dissolvit. Momento
fit cinis, diu sylva--It takes an age to
build a city, but an hour involves it in ruin.
A forest is long in growing, but in a moment it
may be reduced to ashes. Sen.

Urbi et orbi--For Rome (lit. the city) and the
world.

Urit enim fulgore suo, qui prægravat artes /
Infra se positas: exstinctus amabitur idem--He
who depresses the merits of those beneath
him blasts them by his very splendour; but when
his light is extinguished, he will be admired. Hor.

Ursprünglich eignen Sinn lass dir nicht rauben! /
Woran die Menge glaubt, ist leicht
zu glauben--Let no one conjure you out of
your own native sense of things; what the multitude
believe in is easy to believe. Goethe.

Urticæ proxima sæpe rosa est--The nettle is                         30
often next to the rose. Ovid.

Use almost can change the stamp of nature, /
And either curb the devil or throw him out.
Ham., iii. 4.

Use doth breed a habit in a man. Two Gent.
of Verona, v. 4.

Use every man after his desert, and who
should 'scape whipping? Use them after
your own honour and dignity; the less they
deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Ham., ii. 2.

Use him (the frog or bait) as if you loved him.
Isaak Walton.

Use is the judge, the law, and rule of speech.                      35
Roscommon.

Use makes a better soldier than the most
urgent considerations of duty--familiarity
with danger enabling him to estimate the
danger. He sees how much is the risk, and
is not afflicted with imagination; knows
practically Marshal Saxe's rule, that every
soldier killed costs the enemy his weight in
lead. Emerson.

Use sin as it will use you; spare it not, for it
will not spare you: it is your murderer, and
the murderer of the whole world. Use it,
therefore, as a murderer should be used; kill
it before it kills you; and though it bring
you to the grave, it shall not be able to keep
you there. Baxter.

Use sometimes to be alone. George Herbert.

Use the pen; there is no magic in it, but it
keeps the mind from staggering about. (?)

Use thy youth so that thou mayest have comfort                      40
to remember it when it hath forsaken
thee, and not sigh and grieve at the account
thereof. Use it as the springtime which
soon departeth, and wherein thou oughtest
to plant and sow all provisions for a long and
happy life. Sir Walter Raleigh.

Used with due abstinence, hope acts as a
healthful tonic; intemperately indulged, as
an enervating opiate. The visions of future
triumph, which at first animate exertion, if
dwelt upon too intently, will usurp the place
of the stern reality; and noble objects will
be contemplated, not for their own inherent
worth, but on account of the day-dreams
they engender. Thus hope, aided by imagination,
makes one man a hero, another a
somnambulist, and a third a lunatic; while it
renders them all enthusiasts. Sir J. Stephen.

Useful be where thou livest, that they may /
Both want and wish thy pleasing presence
still. / Kindness, good parts, great places,
are the way / To compass this. George
Herbert.

Usefulness comes by labour, wit by ease.
George Herbert.

Usque ad aras--To the very altars; to the last
extremity.

Usque ad nauseam--Till one is utterly sick
of it.

Usque adeone mori miserum est?--Is it then so                        5
very dreadful to die? Virg.

Usque adeone / Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire
hoc sciat alter?--Is then your knowledge to
pass for nothing unless others know of it?

Usually speaking, the worst-bred person in
company is a young traveller just returned
from abroad. Swift.

Usury is a "concessum propter duritiam cordis"
(a concession on account of hardness of
heart); for, since there must be borrowing
and lending, and men are so hard of heart as
they will not lend freely, usury must be permitted.
Bacon.

Usus est tyrannus--Custom is a tyrant. Pr.

Usus promptum facit--Practice makes perfect.                        10
Pr.

Ut ager, quamvis fertilis, sine cultura fructuosus
esse non potest, sic sine doctrina
animus--As a field, however fertile, can yield
no fruit without culture, so neither can the mind
of man without education. Sen.

drinking and running. Pr.

will is commendable, though the ability

must you humour them. Think, at the same
time, how short life is. Plaut.

Ut homo est, ita morem geras--As a man is, so                       15
must you humour him. Ter.

Ut placeas, debes immemor esse tui--That you                        20
may please others you must be forgetful of yourself.
Ovid.

Ut plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco /
Ignotos--As is the way with most people, you
turn up your nose at men of obscure origin.
Hor.

Ut possedis--As you now are; as you possess.

Ut prosim--That I may benefit others. M.

Ut quimus, quando ut volumus non licet--As
we can, when we cannot as we wish. Ter.

Ut quisque contemtissimus et ludibrio est, ita                      25
solutæ linguæ est--The more despicable and
ridiculous a man is, the readier he is with his
tongue. Sen.

Ut ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent, /
Humani vultus--Human countenances, as they
smile on those who smile, so they weep with
those that weep. Hor.

often are men of the greatest genius lost
in obscurity! Plaut.

have sown so shall you also reap. Cic.

human affairs go, nothing is everlasting. Plaut.

Ut sunt molles in calamitate mortalium animi!--How                  30
weak are the hearts of mortals under
calamity! Tac.

administrator equally in peace or in war. Ovid.

attained to fame by their industry, this man has
by his indolence. Tac.

nulli--It is equally an error to confide in all and
in none. Sen.

Uttered out of time, or concealed in its season,                    40
good savoureth of evil. Tupper.

Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, /
That the rude sea grew civil at her song, /

ready to forge cannon-balls or to print New
Testaments; to navigate a corsair's vessel
or a missionary ship. Horace Mann.

bringt kein Frühling mir zurück--What a
moment has taken from me no spring brings
back to me. Hoffmann.

it springs; no more can moral theories. J. C.

did shrink, / Water, water everywhere, / Nor
any drop to drink. Coleridge.

flow. Pr.

were not opaque. Emerson.

We all bear the misfortunes of other people
with a heroic constancy. La Roche.

We all complain of the shortness of time, and
yet have much more than we know what to
do with. Our lives are spent either in doing
nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the
purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought
to do; we are always complaining our days
are few, and acting as though there would
be no end of them. Sen.

We all know a hundred whose coats are well                          35
made, and a score who have excellent
manners; but of gentlemen how many? Let
us take a little scrap of paper and each
make out his list. Thackeray.

and wreck is seldom so much an insufficient
knowledge of the route, as imperfect discipline
of the will. John Morley.

and the pleasure of pleasing ought
to be greatest, and at last always will be
greatest, when our endeavours are exerted

stern, terrible. Joubert.

perfection. Vauvenargues.

hue, the hue of our moral character, from

the same opinion as ourselves. Thomas à
Kempis.

see only the past. Mme. Swetchine.

morning of the times. Tennyson.

We are apt to mistake our vocation by looking                       10
out of the way for occasions to exercise
great and rare virtues, and by stepping over
the ordinary ones that lie directly in the
road before us. Hannah More.

We are apt to pick quarrels with the world
for every little foolery. L'Estrange.

We are as liable to be corrupted by books as
by companions. Fielding.

We are as much informed of a writer's genius
by what he selects as by what he originates.

We are as turkeys driven, with a stick and
red clout, to market. Sterne.

We are awkward for want of thought. The                             15
inspiration is scanty, and does not arrive
at the extremities. Emerson.

We are born with faculties and powers capable
almost of anything, such, at least, as might
carry us further than can easily be imagined;
but it is only the exercise of those
powers that gives us ability and skill in
anything, and leads us towards perfection.
Locke.

We are bound to be honest, but not to be rich.
Pr.

We are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
because our days upon earth are a shadow.

and again when we are grey and put
all our burden on the Lord. J. M. Barrie.

years, to say anything new in morality.
The finest and most beautiful thoughts concerning
manners have been carried away
before our times, and nothing is left for us
but to glean after the ancients and the more
ingenious of the moderns. La Bruyère.

feel it is an art beyond us. Mackenzie.

and not happy because we are contented.
Landor.

the prerogative of a higher power. Montaigne.

round a little, and see what is passing under
our eyes. Carlyle.

on things perishable an imperishable

should our courage be. Hen. V., iv. 1.

not know, because they have never deceived
us. Johnson.

We can only obey our own polarity. Emerson.

We are instinctively more inclined to hope
than to fear; just as our eyes turn of themselves
towards light rather than darkness.
Schopenhauer.

We are less convinced by what we hear than
by what we see. Herodotus.

We are members of one great body. Nature
planted in us a mutual love, and fitted us for
a social life. We must consider that we were
born for the good of the whole. Sen.

ye go for men. Macb., iii. 1.

than when we are discontented with ourselves.

We are never more like God than when we                             40
are doing good. Calvin.

imagine. La Roche.

any of the great achievements which are the
landmarks of human action and human progress.
Disraeli.

We are not, indeed, satisfied with our own
opinions, whatever we may pretend, till they
are ratified and confirmed by suffrage of the
rest of mankind. We dispute and wrangle
for ever; we endeavour to get men to come
to us when we do not go to them. Sir Joshua
Reynolds.

We are not sent into this world to do anything
into which we cannot put our hearts. We
have certain work to do for our bread, and
that is to be done strenuously; other work
to do for our delight, and that is to be done
heartily; neither is to be done by halves or
shifts, but with a will; and what is not worth
this effort is not to be done at all. Ruskin.

We are not strong by our power to penetrate,
but by our relatedness. Emerson.

We are not to be astonished that the wise
walk more slowly in their road to virtue
than fools in their passage to vice; since

time, if the eternal is every moment present.

whom we think so. Lord Greville.

know how to appreciate. Goethe.

our pretensions. Mme. de Girardin.

We are ourselves / Our heaven and hell, the
joy, the penalty, / The yearning, the fruition.
Lewis Morris.

We are pent, / Who sing to-day, by all the
garnered wealth / Of ages of past song.
Lewis Morris.

autumn and winter we stand by the old;
reformers in the morning, conservers at
night. Emerson.

We are rid of the Wicked One, but the wicked
are still with us. Goethe.

We are ruined not by what we really want,                           15

what we omitted to do. Johnson.

rests / Upon our will.... And
when we think we lead, we are most led.

We are such stuff / As dreams are made on;
and our little life / Is rounded with a sleep.

aright. Hazlitt.

three times as much by our pride, and four
times as much by our folly; and from these
taxes the Commissioners cannot ease or
deliver us by allowing an abatement. Ben.
Franklin.

We are the children of our own deeds. Victor
Hugo.

We are the miracle of miracles--the great
inscrutable mystery of God. We cannot
understand it, we know not how to speak of
it; but we may feel and know, if we like,
that it is verily so. Carlyle.

We are the slaves of objects round us, and
appear little or important according as
these contract or give us room to expand.
Goethe.

We are to earn the joys of a higher existence,                      25
not by scorning, but by using, all the gifts
of God in this. W. R. Greg.

We are too good for pure instinct. Goethe.

We are very fond of some families because
they can be traced beyond the Conquest,
whereas indeed the farther back the worse,
as being the nearer allied to a race of
robbers and thieves. De Foe.

We are wiser than we know. Emerson.

We ask advice, but we mean approbation.
Colton.

We barter life for pottage. Keble.                                30

hour. W. R. Greg.

any other way. Rowland Hill.

the truth. St. Paul.

We can finish nothing in this life, but we can
make a beginning, and bequeath a noble
example. Smiles.

We can hardly be confident of the state of
our own minds, but as it stands attested by
some external action. Johnson.

without religion; so, on the other hand,
there is nothing better to be expected from
religion without morality. Sterne.

We can live without our friends, but not without                    40
our neighbours. Pr.

We can more easily avenge an injury than
requite a kindness; on this account, because
there is less difficulty in getting the better of
the wicked than in making one's self equal
with the good. Cic.

We can never soon enough convince ourselves
how easily we can be dispensed with
in the world. Goethe.

We can offer up much in the large, but to
make sacrifices in little things is what we are
seldom equal to. Goethe.

We can only know a little, and the question is
merely whether or not we know this well.
Goethe.

We can only possess wealth according to our                         45
capacity. Ruskin.

We can receive anything from love, for that is
a way of receiving it from ourselves; but
not from any one who assumes to bestow.
Emerson.

We can sometimes love what we do not understand,
but it is impossible completely to
understand what we do not love. Mrs.
Jameson.

We can take up no scheme, however wild and
impracticable, but it will strike off some
flower or fruit from the tree of knowledge.
Ward Beecher.

measure utilise it. The projectile force of
the bullet does not annul or suspend gravity;
it uses it. John Burroughs.

Cannot be truly follow'd. King Lear, v. 3.

We cannot all serve our country in the same
way, but each may do his best, according as
God has endowed him. Goethe.

like opaline dove's-neck lustres, hovering
and evanescent. Herein it resembles the
most excellent things, which have all this
rainbow character, defying all attempts at
appropriation and use. Emerson.

We cannot be just if we are not humane.                              5
Vauvenargues.

We cannot be kind to each other here for an
hour; / We whisper, and hint, and chuckle,
and grin at a brother's shame; / However
we brave it out, we men are a little breed.
Tennyson.

We cannot but speak the things we have seen
and heard. St. Peter and St. John.

We cannot conquer fate and necessity, yet we
can yield to them in such a manner as to be
greater than if we could. Landor.

We cannot fashion our children after our
fancy. We must have them and love them
as God has given them to us. Goethe.

We should be wooed, and were not made to
woo. Mid. N.'s Dream, ii. 2.

We cannot make our exodus from Houndsditch
(i.e., the now dead religion of the past)
till we have got our own (i.e., out of it) along
with us. Carlyle.

We cannot overstate our debt to the past, but
the moment has the supreme claim. Emerson.

We cannot part with our friends. We cannot
let our angels go. We do not see that they
only go out that archangels may come in.
We are idolaters of the old. We do not
believe in the richness of the soul, in its
proper eternity and omnipresence. Emerson.

We cannot pass our guardian angel's bound, /
Resign'd or sullen, he will hear our sighs.
Keble.

We cannot speak a loyal word and be meanly                          15
silent; we cannot kill and not kill at the
same moment; but a moment is room enough
for the loyal and mean desire, for the outflash
of a murderous thought, and the sharp
backward stroke of repentance. George Eliot.

We cannot think too highly of our nature, nor
too humbly of ourselves. Colton.

presence of Paul than of the fair and ruddy

teach them to sing. Jean Paul.

artifices as we do ourselves. Schopenhauer.

of life, have learned to bear its ills without
descanting on the burden. Juv.

We derive from nature no fault that may not                         25
become a virtue, no virtue that may not degenerate
into a fault. Faults of the latter
kind are most difficult to cure. Goethe.

We do everything by custom, even believe by
it; our very axioms, let us boast of our Freethinking
as we may, are oftenest simply such
beliefs as we have never heard questioned.
Carlyle.

We do not believe immortality because we
have proved it, but we for ever try to prove
it because we believe it. James Martineau.

amongst those of the highest fortune. Juv.

We do not correct the man we hang; we correct
others by him. Montaigne.

We do not count a man's years until he has                          30
nothing else to count. Emerson.

We do not determine what we will think....
We have little control over our thoughts.

We do not die wholly at our deaths; we
have mouldered away gradually long before.
Hazlitt.

We do not judge men by what they are in
themselves, but by what they are relatively
to us. Mme. Swetchine.

We do not know what is really good or bad
fortune. Rousseau.

We do not teach one another the lessons of                          35
honesty and sincerity that the brutes do,
or of steadiness and solitude that the rocks
do. The fault is commonly mutual, for we
do not habitually demand any more of each
other. Thoreau.

We don't always care most for those flat-pattern
flowers that press best in the herbarium.
Holmes.

We draw the foam from the great river of
humanity with our quills, and imagine to ourselves
that we have caught floating islands
at least. Goethe.

a weapon to our passion. Goethe.

We easily dispense with what was never our
own. Platen.

doing; and our best doing is our best enjoyment.
Jacobi.

We estimate (lit. measure) great men by their
virtue, not by their success. Corn. Nep.

We exaggerate misfortune and happiness
alike. We are never either so wretched
or so happy as we say we are. Balzac.

well. / Faith can sing through days of sorrow, /

We expect everything, and are prepared for
nothing. Mme. Swetchine.

We expect in letters to discover somewhat                           45
of a person's real character. It is childish
indeed to expect that we are to find the
whole heart of the author unveiled....
Still as letters from one friend to another
make the nearest approaches to conversation,
we may expect to see more of a
character displayed in these than in other
productions which are studied for public
view. Blair.

We expect old men to be conservative, but
when a nation's young men are so, its
funeral-bell is already rung. Ward Beecher.

sticking-place, / And we'll not fail. Macb.,
i. 7.

small, / So wait till life have passed from
out the world. Browning.

We find God twice--once within, once without                         5
us; within us as an eye, without us as a
light. Jean Paul.

We forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order
to be like other people. Schopenhauer.

We furnish our minds as we furnish our houses--with
the fancies of others, and according to
the mode and age of our country; we pick up
our ideas and notions in common conversation
as in schools. Bolingbroke.

We gain nothing by being with such as ourselves.
We encourage one another in mediocrity.
I am always longing to be with men
more excellent than myself. Lamb.

We gain the strength of the temptation we
resist. Emerson.

store; / Enough requires too much; too
much craves more. Quarles.

to profit by it. La Roche.

the grain. W. R. Alger.

are insane, the sane must go to the hospital.

they say, "Darkness, be thou my light."

to great ones. Ger. Pr.

Yet the pursuit, and yet the flight is vain.
Prior.

We hate delay, yet it makes us wise. Pr.

know them, and we will not know them
because we hate them. Colton.

whole human family is bathed with an
element of love like a fine ether. Emerson.

a priest. Amiel.

in this world, and must know the river and
its ways, or get drowned some day. Carlyle.

troubles of others. La Roche.

We have always considered taxes to be the                           25
sinews of the state. Cic.

We have, and this is an interesting fact, a plant
which may serve as a symbol of the most advanced
age, since, having passed the period
of flowers and fruit, it still thrives cheerfully
without further foundation. Goethe.

believe always, and never turn back. Simms.

of enmity, fair love of hate. Rich. III.,

We have met the enemy, and they are ours.
Oliver H. Perry.

We have more indolence in the mind than in
the body. La Roche.

mathesis. Archimedes and Plato could not
have read the "Méchanique Céleste;" but
neither would the whole French Institute see
aught in that saying, "God geometrises," but
sentimental rhodomontade. Carlyle.

We have no more / The world to choose from,                         35
who, where'er we turn, / Tread through old
thoughts and fair. Yet must we sing--/ We
have no choice. Lewis Morris.

his object, whatever it may be, as he saw it.

We have not the innocence of Eden; but by
God's help and Christ's example, we may
have the victory of Gethsemane. Chapin.

We have not the love of greatness, but the
love of the love of greatness. Carlyle.

We have not wings, we cannot soar; / But                            40
we have feet to scale and climb / By slow
degrees, by more and more, / The cloudy
summits of our time. Longfellow.

We have nothing to do with what is happening
in space (or possibly may happen in time);
we have only to attend to what is happening
here--and now. Ruskin.

We have raised Pain and Sorrow into heaven,
and in our temples, on our altars. Grief
stands symbol of our faith, and it shall last
as long as man is mortal and unhappy. Wm.
Smith.

We have scotch'd the snake, but not killed
it. Macb., iii. 2.

We have such exorbitant eyes, that, on seeing
the smallest arc, we complete the curve, and
when the curtain is lifted from the diagram
which it served to veil, we are vexed to find
that no more was drawn than just that
fragment of an arc which we first beheld.
Emerson.

We hear constantly of what Nature is doing,                         45
but we rarely hear of what man is thinking.
We want ideas, and we get more facts.
Buckle.

We hear the rain fall, but not the snow. Bitter
grief is loud, calm grief is silent. Auerbach.

We, ignorant of ourselves, / Beg often our own
harms, which the wise powers / Deny us for
our good; so find we profit / By losing of our
prayers. Ant. and Cleo., ii. 1.

We in turn / Shall one day be Time's ancients,
and inspire / The wiser, higher race, which
yet shall sing; / Because to sing is human,
and high thought / Grows rhythmic ere its
close. Lewis Morris.

We inherit, not life only, but all the garniture
and form of life; and work, and speak, and
even think and feel, as our fathers, and
primeval grandfathers, from the beginning,
have given it us. Carlyle.

We injure mysteries, which are matters of
faith, by any attempt at explanation in order
to make them matters of reason. Could
they be explained, they would cease to be
mysteries; and it has been well said that a
thing is not necessarily against reason because
it happens to be above it. Colton.

We keep but what we give, / And only daily                           5
dying may we live. Lewis Morris.

We know accurately only when we know
little; with knowledge doubt increases.
Goethe.

We know better than we do. Emerson.

We know God easily, provided we do not
constrain ourselves to define him. Joubert.

We know not oftentimes what we are able to
do, but temptations shows us what we are.
Thomas à Kempis.

We know truth when we see it, let sceptic                           10
and scoffer say what they choose. Emerson.

We know what we are, but we know not
what we may be. Ham., iv. 5.

We learn nothing from mere hearing, and he
who does not take an active part in certain
subjects knows them but half and superficially.
Goethe.

We learn to know a thing best in the place
where it is native. Goethe.

We learn to know nothing but what we love;
and the deeper we mean to penetrate into
any matter with insight, the stronger and
more vital must our love and passion be.
Goethe.

We learn wisdom from failure much more than                         15
from success; we often discover what will
do by finding out what will not do; and probably
he who never made a mistake never
made a discovery. Horne Tooke used to
say of his studies in intellectual philosophy,
that he had become all the better acquainted
with the country through having had the
good luck sometimes to lose his way. Smiles.

We lie down and rise up with the skeleton
allotted to us for our mortal companion--the
phantom of ourselves. Dickens.

We like only such actions as have long already
had the praise of men, and do not perceive
that anything man can do may be
divinely done. Emerson.

We like slipping, but not falling; our real
desire is to be tempted enough. Hare.

We like to see through others, but not that
others should see through us. La Roche.

We live by admiration, hope, and love; / And                        20
even as these are well and wisely fix'd, / In
dignity of being we ascend. Wordsworth.

We live by our imaginations, by our admirations,
by our sentiments. Emerson.

We live in a real, and a solid, and a truthful
world. In such a world only truth, in the
long run, can hope to prosper. Prof. Blackie.

We live in a world which is full of misery and
ignorance, and the plain duty of each and
all of us is to try to make the little corner
he can influence somewhat less miserable
and somewhat less ignorant than it was
before he entered it. To do this effectually,
it is necessary to be fully possessed of only
two beliefs: the first, that the order of
nature is ascertainable by our faculties to an
extent which is practically unlimited; the
second, that our volition counts for something
as a condition of the course of events.
Huxley.

We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not
breaths; / In feelings, not in figures on a
dial. Bailey. (?)

We live in the age of systems. Rückert.                           25

We loathe what none are left to share; / Even
bless 'twere woe alone to bear. Byron.

We long in vain to undo what has been done.
Schopenhauer.

We long to use what lies beyond our scope, /
Yet cannot use even what within it lies.
Goethe.

We look before and after, / And pine for what
is not; / E'en our sincerest laughter / With
some pain is fraught; / Our sweetest songs
are those which tell of saddest thought.
Shelley.

We love a girl for very different things than                       30
understanding. We love her for her beauty,
her youth, her mirth, her confidingness, her
character, with its faults, caprices, and God
knows what other inexpressible charms; but
we do not love her for her understanding. Her
mind we esteem (if it is brilliant), and it may
greatly elevate her in our opinion; nay,
more, it may enchain us when we already
love. But her understanding is not that
which awakens and inflames our passions.
Goethe.

We love in others what we lack ourselves, /
And would be everything but what we are.
R. H. Stoddart.

We love justice greatly, and just men but
little. Joseph Roux.

We love peace, as we abhor pusillanimity;
but not peace at any price. There is a
peace more destructive of the manhood of
living man than war is destructive of his
material body. Chains are worse than
bayonets. Douglas Jerrold.

We love those who admire us, but not those
whom we admire. La Roche.

We love to see wisdom in unpretending forms,                        35
to recognise her royal features under a
week-day vesture. Carlyle.

We make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge, when we
should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.
All's Well, ii. 3.

We make way for the man who boldly pushes
past us. Bovee.

We manufacture everything there (in our manufacturing
cities) except men; we blanch cotton,
and strengthen steel, and refine sugar, and
shape pottery; but to brighten, to strengthen,
to refine, or to form a single living
spirit, never enters into our estimate of advantages.
Ruskin.

We may acquire liberty, but it is never recovered
if it is once lost. Rousseau.

We may all agree in lamenting that there are
so many houses where you will not find a
good atlas, a good dictionary, or a good
cyclopædia of reference. What is still more
lamentable, in a good many more houses
where these books are, is that they are
never referred to or opened. John Morley.

We may almost say that a new life begins
when a man once sees with his own eyes
all that before he has but partially read or
heard of. Goethe.

We may be as good as we please, if we please
to be good. Barrow.

We may be pretty certain that persons whom                           5
all the world treats ill deserve entirely the
treatment they get. Thackeray.

We may build more splendid habitations, /
Fill our rooms with paintings and with sculptures,/
But we cannot / Buy with gold the
old associations! Longfellow.

We may daily discover crowds acquire sufficient
wealth to buy gentility, but very few
that possess the virtues which ennoble human
nature, and (in the best sense of the word)
constitute a gentleman. Shenstone.

We may despise the world, but we cannot do
without it. Baron Wessenberg.

We may fall in with a thousand learned men
before we fall in with one wise. Klinger.

We may give more offence by our silence than                        10
even by impertinence. Hazlitt.

We may grasp virtue so hard as to convert
it into a vice. Montaigne.

We may have a law, or we may have no law,
but we cannot have half a law. Johnson.

We may have once been slugs, and may one
day be angels, but we are men now; and
we must, as men, do our work honourably and
thoroughly. Ruskin.

We may lay in a stock of pleasures, as we
would lay in a stock of wine; but if we defer
the tasting of them too long, we shall find
that both are soured by age. Colton.

We may, like the ships, by tempests be toss'd /                     15
On perilous deeps, but cannot be lost. Newton.

We may not be able to parry evil thoughts, but
we may surely guard against their taking root
in us and bringing forth evil deeds. Luther.

We may outrun / By violent swiftness that
which we run at, / And lose by overrunning.
Hen. VIII., i. 1.

We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said
of strawberries, "Doubtless God could have
made a better berry, but doubtless God
never did;" and so, if I might be judge, God
never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent
recreation than angling. Izaak Walton.

We may seek God by our intellect (Verstand),
but we can find him only with the
heart. Cötvös.

We may take Fancy for a companion, but must                         20
follow Reason as our guide. Johnson.

We mount to heaven mostly on the ruins of
our cherished schemes, finding our failures
were successes. A. B. Alcott.

We move too much in platoons; we march
by sections; we do not live in our vital individuality
enough; we are slaves to fashion,
in mind and in heart, if not to our passions
and appetites. Chapin.

We must accept ourselves as we are. Scherer.

We must accept the post to which Heaven
appoints us, and do the duty to which
Heaven calls us, and think it no shame,
but an honour, to hold any office, however
lowly, under heaven's King. Ed.

We must all receive and learn both from those                       25
who were before us and from those who are
with us. Even the greatest genius would not
go far if he tried to owe everything to his
own internal self. Goethe.

We must all toil--or steal; no faithful workman
finds his life a pastime. Carlyle.

We must avoid fastidiousness; neatness, when
it is moderate, is a virtue; but when it is
carried to an extreme, it narrows the mind.
Fénelon.

We must be as courteous to a man as we are
to a picture, which we are willing to give the
advantage of a good light. Emerson.

We must be free or die who speak the tongue /
That Shakespeare spake, the faith and morals
hold / Which Milton held. Wordsworth.

We must be our own before we can be                                 30
another's. Emerson.

We must bear what Heaven sends us; no
noble heart will bear injustice. Schiller.

We must carry the beautiful with us, or we
find it not. Emerson.

We must first cross a valley before we regain
a favourable and cheerful height; meanwhile,
let us see how we can stroll through
it with our friends pleasantly and profitably.
Goethe.

We must first pray, and then labour; first implore
the blessing of God, and use those
means which he puts into our hands.
Johnson.

We must have the real thing before we can                           35
have a science of the thing. Froude.

We must hold by what is definite, and not
split up our strength in many directions.
Hegel.

We must, if we would husband life and not
waste it, bravely resolve to dispense with
the dispensable, to content ourselves with
the minimum of want, to stake our reputation,
if such be dear to us, upon intrinsic
worth, and show once again, if we can, by
our mere life and labour, what are the "roots
of honour" and the "veins of wealth." Ed.

We must judge of a form of government by its
general tendency, not by happy accidents.
Macaulay.

We must labour unceasingly to render our
piety reasonable, and our reason pious.
Mme. Swetchine.

We must needs die, and are as water spilt on                        40
the ground which cannot be gathered up
again. Bible.

We must not arrogate to ourselves a spirit of
forgiveness, until we have been touched to
the quick where we are sensitive and borne
it meekly. Ward Beecher.

We must not contradict, but instruct, him that
contradicts us. Antisthenes.

We must not judge of despots by the temporary
successes which the possession of
power enabled them to achieve, but by the
state in which they leave their country at
their death or at their fall. Mme. de Staël.

We must not make a scarecrow of the law.
Meas. for Meas., ii. 1.

We must not only strike the iron while it is
hot, but strike it till it is made hot. Sharp.

We must not regard what the many say of us;
but what he, the one man who has understanding
of just and unjust, will say, and
what the truth will say. Plato.

We must not stand upon trifles. Cervantes.

We must not stint / Our necessary actions, in                        5
the fear / To cope malicious censurers; which
ever, / As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow /
That is new trimmed, but benefit no further /
Than vainly longing. Hen. VIII., i. 2.

We must not suppose ourselves always to have
conquered a temptation when we have fled
from it. Thomas à Kempis.

We must not take the faults of our youth with
us into our old age, for old age brings with it
its own defects. Goethe.

We must put up with our contemporaries,
since we can neither live with our ancestors
nor posterity. George Eliot.

We must sometimes cease to adhere to our
own opinion for the sake of peace. Thomas
à Kempis.

We must strive to make of humanity one                              10
single family. Mazzini.

We must take the current when it serves, / Or
lose our ventures. Jul. Cæs., iv. 3.

We must take the world as we find it. Pr.

We need change of objects. Emerson.

We (in England) need examples of people who,
leaving Heaven to decide whether they are
to rise in the world, decide for themselves
that they will be happy in it, and have resolved
to seek--not greater wealth, but
simpler pleasure; not higher fortune, but
deeper felicity; making the first of possessions
self-possession, and honouring themselves
in the harmless pride and calm pursuits
of peace. Ruskin.

We need greater virtues to sustain good than                        15
evil fortune. La Roche.

We need not die while we are living. Ward
Beecher.

We needs must love the highest when we see
it, / Not Lancelot, nor another. Tennyson.

We never can know the truth of sin; for its
nature is to deceive alike on the one side
the sinner and on the other the judge.
Ruskin.

We never can say why we love, but only that we
love. The heart is ready enough at feigning
excuses for all that it does or imagines of
wrong; but ask it to give a reason for any
of its beautiful and divine motions, and it can
only look upward and be dumb. Lowell.

We never desire ardently what we desire                             20
rationally. La Roche.

We never learn what people are by their
coming to us; we must go to them if we
wish to know what they are made of, and
see how they conduct or misconduct their
surroundings. Goethe.

We never live, but we hope to live; and as we
are always arranging for being happy, it
cannot be but that we never are so. Pascal.

We never love truly but once. It is the first
time. Succeeding passions are less involuntary.
Du Cœur.

We never reflect on the man we love without
exulting in our choice; while he who has
bound us to him by benefits alone rises to
our idea as a person to whom we have, in
some measure, forfeited our freedom. Goldsmith.

We never see anything isolated in Nature,                           25
but everything in connection with something
else which is before it, beside it, under
it, and over it. Goethe.

We never sufficiently consider that a language
is properly only symbolical, only figurative,
and expresses objects never immediately,
but only in reflection; yet how difficult it is
not to put the sign in place of the thing,
always to keep the thing as it is (das Wesen)
before one's mind, and not annihilated by
the expression (das Wort). Goethe.

We often quarrel with the unfortunate to get
rid of pitying them. Vauvenargues.

We ought certainly to despise malice if we
cannot oppose it. Goldsmith.

We ought not, in general, to take the opinions
of others upon trust, but to reason and judge
for ourselves. Locke.

We ought not to isolate ourselves, for we                           30
cannot remain in a state of isolation. Social
intercourse makes us the more able to bear
with ourselves and with others. Goethe.

We ought not to judge men by their absolute
excellence, but by the distance which they
have travelled from the point at which they
started. Ward Beecher.

We ought not to quit our post without the
permission of Him who commands; the post
of man is life. Pythagoras.

We ought not to seek too high joys. We may
be bright without transfiguration. Ward
Beecher.

We ought not to teach children the sciences,
but to give them a taste for them. Rousseau.

We ought to attempt no more than what is in                         35
the compass of our genius and according to
our vein. Dryden.

We ought to be ashamed of our pride, but
never proud of our shame. (?)

We ought to obey God rather than man. St.
Peter.

We ought to regard our servants as friends in
a lower state. Plato.

We our betters see bearing our woes, / We
scarcely think our miseries our foes. King
Lear, iii. 6.

We owe it to our ancestors to preserve entire                       40
those rights which they have delivered to
our care; we owe it to our posterity not to
suffer their dearest inheritance to be destroyed.
Junius.

We owe to man higher succours than food and
fire. We owe to man, man. Emerson.

We own whom we love. The universe is
God's because He loves. Ward Beecher.

We pain ourselves to please nobody. Emerson.

We pardon as long as we love. La Roche.

We part with true joy almost more lightly                           45
than with a beautiful dream. Fr. Grillparzer.

We pass our life in deliberation, and we die
upon it. Pasquier Quesnel.

We pity in others only those evils which we
have ourselves experienced. Rousseau.

We play the fools with the time, and the spirits
of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
Hen. IV., ii. 2.

We poets in our youth begin in gladness, /
But thereof come in the end despondency
and madness. Wordsworth.

We promise according to our hopes, and perform
according to our fears. La Roche.

We properly learn from those books only
which are above our criticism, which we
cannot judge. Goethe.

We read far too many things, thus losing time                        5
and gaining nothing. We should only read
what we admire. Goethe.

We readily believe what we wish to be true. Pr.

We reap what we sow, but Nature has love
over and above that justice, and gives us
shadow and blossom and fruit that spring
from no planting of ours. George Eliot.

We receive but little advantage from repeated
protestations of gratitude, but they cost
them very much from whom we exact them
in return. Goldsmith.

We reform others unconsciously when we
walk uprightly. Mme. Swetchine.

We retain from our studies only that which                          10
we practically apply. Goethe.

We sacrifice to dress till household joys and
comforts cease. Dress drains our cellar
dry and keeps our larder lean. Cowper.

We see but the outside of the rich man's
happiness; few consider him to be like the
silkworm, that, when she seems to play, is
at the very same time spinning her own
bowels and consuming herself. Isaac Walton.

We see farthest into the future--and that is
not far--when we most carefully consider
the facts of the present. Dr. Jowett.

We see so darkly into futurity, we never know
when we have real cause to rejoice or lament.
The worst appearances have often happy
consequences, as the best lead many times
into the greatest misfortunes. Lady Montagu.

We see the blossoms wither and the leaves                           15
fall, but we likewise see fruits ripen and new
buds shoot forth. Goethe.

We seek but half the causes of our deeds, /
Seeking them only in the outer life, / And
heedless of the encircling spirit-world, /
Which, though unseen, is felt, and sows in
us / All germs of pure and world-wide purposes.
Lowell.

We seldom give our love to what is worthiest
in its object. J. M. Barrie.

We seldom speak of the virtue we have, but
much more frequently of that which we have
not. Lessing.

"We shall fight in the shade." Leonidas, to
the threat of the Persians that their forest of
arrows would darken the sun.

We shall find no fiend in hell can match the                        20
fury of a disappointed woman,--scorned,
slighted, dismissed without a parting pang.
Cibber.

We should always keep a corner of our heads
open and free, that we may make room for
the opinions of our friends. Joubert.

We should be slower to think that the man
at his worst is the real man, and certain
that the better we are ourselves the less
likely is he to be at his worst in our company.
J. M. Barrie.

We should be sparing in our intimacies; because
it so very often happens that the more
perfectly men are understood, the less they
are esteemed. Thomas à Kempis.

We should come home from adventures, and
perils, and discoveries every day with new
experience and character. Thoreau.

We should count time by heart-throbs. / He                          25
most lives / Who thinks most, feels the
noblest, / Acts the best. Bailey.

We should despise the wretch who has never
once thought what it is he is doing (vollbringt).
Goethe (?).

We should distinguish between laughter inspired
by joy, and that which arises from
mockery. Goldsmith.

We should eat to live, and not live to eat.
Pr.

We should feel sorrow, but not sink under its
oppression. Confucius.

We should forgive freely, but forget rarely.                        30
I will not be revenged, and this I owe to my
enemy; but I will remember, and this I owe
to myself. Colton.

We should guard against a talent which we
cannot hope to practise in perfection. Improve
it as we may, we shall always in the
end, when the merit of the master has become
apparent to us, painfully lament the
loss of time and strength devoted to such
botching. Goethe.

We should have all our communications with
men as in the presence of God; and with
God, as in the presence of men. Colton.

We should hold the immutable mean that lies
between insensibility and anguish; our attempts
should be, not to extinguish nature,
but to repress it; not to stand unmoved at
distress, but endeavour to turn every disaster
to our own advantage. Confucius.

We should labour to treat with ease of things
that are difficult; with familiarity, of things
that are novel; and with perspicuity, of things
that are profound. Colton.

We should live each day as if it were the full                      35
term of our life. (?)

We should manage our fortune like our constitution;
enjoy it when good, have patience
when bad, and never apply violent remedies
but in cases of necessity. La Roche.

We should never risk pleasantry except with
well-bred people, and people with brains.
La Bruyère.

We should never so entirely avoid danger as
to appear irresolute and cowardly; but, at
the same time, we should avoid unnecessarily
exposing ourselves to danger, than
which nothing can be more foolish. Cic.

We should not be too hasty in bestowing either
our praise or censure on mankind, since we
shall often find such a mixture of good and
evil in the same character, that it may require
a very accurate judgment and a very
elaborate inquiry to determine on which side
the balance turns. Fielding.

We should not spur a willing horse. Pr.                           40

We should not trust the heart too much. The
heart speaks to us very gladly, as our mouth
expresses itself. If the mouth were as much
inclined to speak the feelings of the heart,
it would have been the fashion long ago to
put a padlock on the mouth. Lessing.

We should often feel ashamed of our most
brilliant actions were the world to see the
motives from which they sprung. La Roche.

We should only utter higher maxims so far as
they can benefit the world. The rest we
should keep within ourselves, and they will
diffuse over our actions a lustre like the mild
radiance of a hidden sun. Goethe.

We should round every day of stirring action
with an evening of thought. We learn
nothing of our experience except we muse
upon it. Bovee.

We should seem ignorant that we oblige, and
leave the mind at full liberty to give or refuse
its affections; for constraint may indeed
leave the receiver still grateful but it will
certainly produce disgust. Goldsmith.

We should take a prudent care for the future,                        5
but so as to enjoy the present. It is no part
of wisdom to be miserable to-day, because
we may happen to be so to-morrow. (?)

We should, to the last moment of our lives,
continue a settled intercourse with all the true
examples of grandeur. Sir Joshua Reynolds.

We shut our eyes, and, like people in the
dark, we fall foul upon the very thing we
search for, without finding it. Sen.

We sink to rise. Emerson.

We smile at the satire expended upon the
follies of others, but we forget to weep at our
own. Mme. Necker.

We sometimes meet an original gentleman,                            10
who, if manners had not existed, would have
invented them. Emerson.

We sometimes see a change of expression in
our companion, and say, His father or his
mother comes to the windows of his eyes,
and sometimes a remote relative. In different
hours, a man represents each of several of
his ancestors, as if there were seven or eight
of us rolled up in each man's skin--seven or
eight ancestors at least--and they constitute
the variety of notes for that new piece of
music which his life is. Emerson.

We speak that we do know, and testify that
we have seen. Jesus.

We still are fain, with wrath and strife, / To
seek for gain, to shrink from loss, / Content
to scratch our shallow cross / On the rough
surface of old life. Dr. W. Smith.

We swallow at one gulp a lie which flatters
us, but only drop by drop a truth which is
bitter to us. Diderot.

We take a great deal for granted in this world,                     15
and expect that everything, as a matter of
course, ought to fit into our humours, wishes,
and wants; it is often only when danger
threatens that we awake to the discovery
that the guiding reins are held by one whom
we had well-nigh forgotten in our careless
ease. Mrs. Gatty.

When we come home, are to ourselves unknown,
/ And unacquainted still with our
own soul. Davies.

We think our civilisation near its meridian;
but we are yet only at the cock-crowing and
the morning star. Emerson.

We tolerate everybody, because we doubt                             25
everything; or else we tolerate nobody, because
we believe something. Mrs. E. B.
Browning.

We trample grass, and prize the flowers of
May; / Yet grass is green when flowers do
fade away. R. Southwell.

him from our thoughts, not by referring to
his will on slight occasions. Ruskin.

We triumph without glory when we conquer
without danger. Corn.

We underpin our houses with granite; what                           30
of our habits and our lives? Thoreau.

We use up in the passions the stuff that was

than anything else. Ruskin.

We want foolishly to think the creed a man
professes a more significant fact than the
man he is. Thoreau.

We want one man to be always thinking, and
another to be always working, and we call
the one a gentleman, and the other an operative;
whereas the workman ought often to
be thinking, and the thinker often to be
working, and both should be gentlemen in
the best sense. Ruskin.

We waste our best years in distilling the
sweetest flowers of life into potions which,
after all, do not immortalise, but only intoxicate.

challenge the Judge of all with it as he
should enter his presence. Dr. Gordon.

we publish them. All's Well, i. 3.

better fortune, and turn away our eyes, lest
the wants and woes of our brother-mortals
should disturb the selfish apathy of our
souls. Burns.

We write from aspiration and antagonism, as
well as from experience. We paint those
qualities which we do not possess. Emerson.

We'd jump the life to come. But, in these                           10
cases, / We still have judgment here; that
we but teach / Bloody instructions, which,
being taught, return / To plague the inventor.
This even-handed justice / Commends
the ingredients of our poison'd chalice /
To our own lips. Macb., i. 7.

beggar's song, that lived upon the alms-basket.

which cannot be amended. La Roche.

Weaknesses, so called, are neither more nor
less than vice in disguise. Lavater.

heart, as frost and fire are both alien to the
human flesh. Famine and gluttony alike
drive nature away from the heart of man.

Wealth consists of the good, and therefore
useful, things in the possession of the nation;
money is only the written or coined
sign of the relative quantities of wealth in
each person's possession. Ruskin.

Wealth cannot purchase any great private                            20

at which the man in his native poverty
would have revolted. Burns.

intrinsic value and of a capacity to use it.

himself only, and with no meaner bait.
Emerson.

Wealth is not his that has it, but his that
enjoys it. Ben. Franklin.

Wealth is the application of mind to nature;

order, in timeliness, in being at the right
spot. Emerson.

Wealth is the conjuror's devil; / Whom when he
thinks he hath, the devil hath him. Herbert.

Wealth is the possession of useful articles
which we can use, (so that) instead of depending
merely on a "have," it is thus seen
to depend on a "can." Ruskin.

Wealth leaves us at death; kinsmen at the                           30
grave; but virtues of the mind unto the
heavens with us we have. Lord Vaux.

Wealth makes wit waver. Sc. Pr.

Wealth maketh many friends, but the poor is
separated from his neighbour. Bible.

Wealth of every species necessarily flows to
the hands of him who exerteth himself.
Hitopadesa.

Wealth only by its use we know. Anon.

Wealth, power, and even the advantages of                           35
youth, have little to do with that which
gives repose to the mind and firmness to
the frame. Scott.

Wealth richer than both the Indies lies for
every man, if he will endure. Not his oaks
only and his fruit-trees, his very heart roots
itself wherever he may abide--roots itself,
draws nourishment from the deep fountains
of universal being. Carlyle.

Wealth which breeds idleness, of which the
English peerage is an example, and of which
we are beginning to abound in specimens in
this country (America), is only a sort of human
oyster-bed, where heirs and heiresses are
planted, to spend a contemptible life of
slothfulness in growing plump and succulent
for the grave-worm's banquet. Horace Mann.

Wealth without contentment climbs a hill, /
To feel those tempests which fly over
ditches. George Herbert.

Wear your learning, like your watch, in a
private pocket; and do not pull it out and
strike it, merely to show that you have one.

like the watchmen. Chesterfield.

Wearers of rings and chains! / Pray do not                          40
take the pains / To set me right. / In vain
my faults ye quote; / I write as others wrote /
On Sunium's height. Landor.

Weariness / Can snore upon the flint, when
resty sloth / Finds the down pillow hard.

rout: / When they that are without would
fain go in, / And they that are within would
fain go out. Sir J. Davis.

who are outside wish to get in, and those
who are inside wish to get out. Arab. Pr.

Wee modest crimson-tipped flower, / Thou's                           5

spare thee now is past my power, / Thou
bonny gem. Burns.

Weep no more, lady, weep no more. / For                             10
sorrow is in vain; / For violets pluck'd, the
sweetest showers / Will ne'er revive again.
Anon.

Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
cometh in the morning. Bible.

Weh dem Lande, wo man nicht mehr singt--Woe
to the land where the voice of song has
gone dumb. Seume.

Weigh not so much what men say, as what
they prove: remembering that truth is simple
and naked, and needs not invective to apparel
her comeliness. Sir P. Sidney.

Weighty things are done in solitude, that is,
without society. The means of improvement
consist not in projects, or in any violent
designs, for these cool, and cool very soon,
but in patient practising for whole long days,
by which I make the thing clear to my highest
reason. Jean Paul.

Weighty work must be done with few words.                           15

for the same reason. Anon.

hath need"--we ask not why, / And in this
faith we live or die. Lewis Morris.

What shapest thou here at the world; 'Tis
shapen long ago; / The Maker shaped it,
He thought it best even so. / Thy lot is

race. Goethe.

revenge the insult, or even return the blow,

that, in God's name, leave uncredited.

What the Maker sends us remains mysteriously
with us after the bearer of it is dead
and gone; and we, as we "mourn over, long
for, and love distant and departed" goodness,
are more embraced and possessed by it than
we were when it was present with us only
in the flesh, and we could look upon it and
handle it. Ed.

poison, is the fleeting and the false. Leigh
Hunt.

What the Puritans gave the world was not
thought, but action. Wendell Phillips.

is the interesting point. Carlyle.

What thou seest is not there on its own                              5
account, strictly taken, is not there at all.

enough in thee to kill care. Much Ado, v. 1.

hodden gray, and a' that? / Gie fools their

man for a' that. Burns.

The fiddlestick shall scrape them
into sense. (?)

Who bravely dares must sometimes risk a
fall. Smollett.

What though the field be lost? / All is not                         10
lost; th' unconquerable will, / And study
of revenge, immortal hate, / And courage
never to submit or yield. Milton.

will from time to time break through! Carlyle.

us? Wordsworth.

best to overlook it; for folly scarcely can deserve
resentment, and malice is punished by

must unquestionably refine our nature and
elevate us in the scale of being. Channing.

incapable of those we owe to the living.

soon as we are aware of it. Goethe.

Whatever is highest and holiest is tinged
with melancholy. The eye of genius has
always a plaintive expression, and its natural
language is pathos. A prophet is sadder

than all prophets was "a man of sorrow and
acquainted with grief." Mrs. Child.

Whatever is, is right. Pope.

Whatever is known to thyself alone has always
very great value. Emerson.

Whatever is natural admits of variety. Mme.
de Stäel.

is holpen takes it for a fortune, and he that
is hurt for a wrong. Bacon.

be burnt in this world. Carlyle.

spot. Willmott.

Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing                        5

which his powers of swimming and wading
must be put to the test again. Goethe.

any one, it is very hard to overcome. If a
dog were made king, would he not gnaw

is to be overcome by bearing it. Virg.

Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared                        10

complication of causes was from eternity
spinning the thread not only of thy being,
but of that which is incident to it. Marcus
Aurelius.

at large, or any individual in it, this is my
measure of iniquity. Burns.

soul, gathers its soft halo from the eyes;
and if the heart be the lurking-place of crime,
the eyes are sure to betray the secret. F.
Saunders.

always be found within a narrow compass,
and amidst the objects more immediately
within our reach. Bulwer Lytton.

Whatever outward thing offers itself to the
eye, is merely the garment or body of a
thing which already existed invisibly within.

duty. T. Edwards.

Whatever the skill of any country may be in                         20
the sciences, it is from its excellence in polite
learning alone that it must expect a character
from posterity. Goldsmith.

Whatever theologians may choose to assert,
it is certain that mankind at large has far
more virtue than vice. Buckle.

Whatever these two men (the Carlyles, father
and son) touched with their hands in honest
toil became sacred to them, a page out of
their own lives. A silent, inarticulate kind
of religion they put into their work. John
Burroughs.

Whatever we think out, whatever we take in
hand to do, should be perfectly and finally
finished, that a word, if it must alter, will
only tend to spoil it; we have then nothing
to do but to unite the severed, to recollect
and restore the dismembered. Goethe.

Whatever you are, be a man. Pr.

Whatever you may think now, they (the deeds                         25
of each day) are only biding their time; and

leisure to hear their story and scoff at you,
they will come forward and tell all the bitter
tale. Disraeli to young men.

there must be some reason for it.

it alone. Scott.

of his integrity, he is set fast; and nothing

Wheresoever two or three living men are                             35

others that we know not of? Ham., iii. 1.

thence. Celia Burleigh.

wants to repose. Dr. Walter Smith.

house. Thoreau.

Wickedness is its own punishment. Quarles.                        35

when we soar. Wordsworth.

Wise, cultivated, genial conversation is the
best flower of civilisation, and the best result
which life has to offer us--a cup for gods,

among whom every villain has a
chance of power, every simpleton of praise,
and every scoundrel of fortune. Ruskin.

Wise men mingle mirth with their cares, as a

to resort to intoxication for the ease of one's
mind is to cure melancholy by madness.

possessor, if he knows not how to use it
discreetly. Montaigne.

Wit is a pernicious thing when it is not tempered                    5

best fire. Sir Thomas Overbury.

liking; / But if thou want it, buy it not too
dear. George Herbert.

there is generally a joyful feeling of strength,

what cannot on any possible ground be defended;
and state only what I know to be
incontrovertibly true. Ruskin.

lover ever best succeeds. Aaron Hill.

lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.

due, when it is in the power of thine hand
to do it. Bible.

not. Ecclus.

men united by the pursuit of a clearly defined
common aim of irresistible attractiveness
naturally coalesce; and since they coalesce
naturally, they are clearly right in coalescing
and find their advantage in it. Matthew
Arnold.

Without tact you can learn nothing. Tact                            45

Women's rage, like shallow water, / Does                            40
but show their hurtless nature; / When the
stream seems rough and frowning, / There
is still least fear of drowning. Durfey.

Women's sins are not alone the ills they do, /
But those that they provoke you to. Dr.
Walter Smith.

Wonder is from surprise, and surprise ceases
upon experience. South.

Wonder on till truth make all things plain.
Mid. N.'s Dream.

"Wonder," says Aristotle, "is the first cause
of philosophy." This is quite as true in the
progress of the individual as in that of the
concrete mind; and the constant aim of
philosophy is to destroy its parent. Bulwer
Lytton.

Wondrous indeed is the virtue of a true book.
Not like a dead city of stones, yearly crumbling,
yearly needing repair; more like a tilled
field, but then a spiritual field; like a spiritual
tree, let me rather say, it stands from year to
year, and from age to age (we have books
that already number some one hundred and
fifty human ages); and yearly comes its
new produce of leaves (commentaries, deductions,
philosophical, political systems, or
were it only sermons, pamphlets, journalistic
essays), every one of which is talismanic and
thaumaturgic, for it can persuade men. Carlyle.

Wondrous is the strength of cheerfulness,
altogether past calculation its powers of
endurance. Carlyle.

Woodman, spare that tree! / Touch not a
single bough! / In youth it sheltered me, /
And I'll protect it now. G. P. Morris.

Words are also actions, and actions are a kind
of words. Emerson.

Words are but poor interpreters in the realms                        5
of emotion. When all words end, music
begins; when they suggest, it realises; and
hence the secret of its strange, ineffable
power. H. R. Haweis.

Words are but wind, but seein's believin'.
Sc. Pr.

Words are fools' pence. Pr.

Words are good, but they are not the best.
The best is not to be explained by words.
Goethe.

Words are like leaves, and when they most
abound / Much fruit of sense beneath is
rarely found. Pope.

Words are like sea-shells on the shore; they                        10
show / Where the mind ends, and not how
far it has been. Bailey.

Words are men's daughters, but God's sons
are things. Izaak Walton.

Words are rather the drowsy part of poetry;
imagination the life of it. Owen Feltham.

Words are the motes of thought, and nothing
more. Bailey.

Words are things, and a small drop of ink, /
Falling like dew upon a thought, produces /
That which makes thousands, perhaps millions,
think. Byron.

Words are wise men's counters, but they are                         15
the money of fools. Hobbes.

Words are women, deeds are men. George
Herbert.

Words become luminous when the finger of
the poet touches them with his phosphorus.
Joubert.

Words do sometimes fly from the tongue that
the heart did neither hatch nor harbour.
Feltham.

Words, like Nature, half reveal / And half
conceal the soul within. Tennyson.

Words may be counterfeit, false coined, and                         20
current only from the tongue, without the
mind; but passion is in the soul, and always
speaks the heart. Southern.

Words of love are works of love. W. R.
Alger.

Words pay no debts. Troil. and Cress.,
iii. 2.

Words that are now dead were once alive.
A. Coles.

Words, "those fickle daughters of the earth,"
are the creation of a being that is finite, and
when applied to explain that which is infinite,
they fail; for that which is made surpasses
not the maker; nor can that which is immeasurable
by our thoughts be measured by
our tongues. Colton.

Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath                          25
give. Macb., ii. 1.

Words which flow fresh and warm from a full
heart, and which are instinct with the life
and breath of human feeling, pass into household
memories, and partake of the immortality
of the affections from which they
spring. Whipple.

Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Ham., iii. 3.

Work, according to my feeling, is as much of
a necessity to man as eating and sleeping.
Even those who do nothing which to a sensible
man can be called work, still imagine
that they are doing something. The world
possesses not a man who is an idler in his
own eyes. W. v. Humboldt.

Work alone is noble. Carlyle.

"Work and wait," "Work and wait," is what                           30
God says to us in creation and in providence.
J. G. Holland.

Work earnestly at anything, you will by degrees
learn to work at almost all things.
Carlyle.

Work first, you are God's servants; fee first,
you are the fiend's. Ruskin.

Work for eternity: not the meagre rhetorical
eternity of the periodical critics, but for the
real eternity, wherein dwelleth the Divine.
Carlyle.

Work for immortality if you will: then wait
for it. J. G. Holland.

Work for some good, be it ever so slowly; /                         35
Cherish some flower, be it ever so lowly; /
Labour! all labour is noble and holy: / Let
thy great deeds be thy prayer to thy God.
Francis S. Osgood.

Work, go, fall, rise, speak, be silent! In this
manner do the rich sport with those needy
men, who are held by the grip of dependence.
Hitopadesa.

Work is for the living. Carlyle.

Work is not man's punishment; it is his reward
and his strength, his glory and his
pleasure. George Sand.

Work is of a religious nature,--work is of
a brave nature, which it is the aim of all
religion to be. "All work of man is as the
swimmer's." A waste ocean threatens to
devour him; if he front it not bravely, it
will keep its word. By incessant wise defiance
of it, lusty rebuke and buffet of it,
behold how it loyally supports him,--bears
him as its conqueror along! "It is so," says
Goethe, "with all things that man undertakes
in this world." Carlyle.

Work is only done well when it is done with                         40
a will. Ruskin.

Work is our business; its success is God's.
Ger. Pr.

Work is the cure for all the maladies and
miseries of man--honest work, which you
intend getting done. Carlyle.

Work is the inevitable condition of human life,
the true source of human welfare. Tolstoi.

Work is the mission of man on this planet.
Carlyle.

Work is the only universal currency which
God accepts. A nation's welfare will depend
on its ability to master the world; that, on
power of work; that, on its power of thought.
Theodore Parker.

Work, properly so called, is an appeal from
the Seen to the Unseen--a devout calling
upon Higher Powers; and unless they stand
by us, it will not be a work, but a quackery.
Carlyle.

Work till the last beam fadeth, / Fadeth to
shine no more; / Work while the night is
darkening, / When man's work is o'er.
Walker.

Work touches the keys of endless activity,                           5
opens the infinite, and stands awe-struck
before the immensity of what there is to do.
Phillips Brooks.

Work was made for man, and not man for
work. J. G. Holland.

Work without hope draws nectar in a sieve, /
And hope without an object cannot live.
Coleridge.

Work, work, work, / Till the brain begins to
swim; / Work, work, work, / Till the eyes
are heavy and dim; / Seam, and gusset,
and band, / Band, and gusset, and seam, /
Till over the buttons I fall asleep, / And sew
them on in a dream. Hood.

Works of true merit are seldom very popular
in their own day; for knowledge is on the
march, and men of genius are the "præstolatores"
or "videttes," that are far in advance
of their comrades. They are not with them,
but before them; not in the camp, but beyond
it. Colton.

Worldly affairs, which my friends thought so                        10
heavy upon me, they are most of them of
our own making, and fall away as soon as
we know ourselves. Law.

Worldly riches are like nuts; many clothes
are torn in getting them, many a tooth
broke in cracking them, but never a belly
filled with eating them. R. Venning.

Worse than being fool'd / Of others, is to fool
one's self. Tennyson.

Worse than despair, / Worse than the bitterness
of death, is hope; / It is the only ill
which can find place / Upon the giddy, sharp,
and narrow hour / Tottering beneath us.
Shelley.

Worship is transcendent wonder; wonder for
which there is no limit or measure. Carlyle.

Worship that is false will kill the soul as                         15
quickly as no worship. Saying.

Worship your heroes from afar; contact
withers them. Mme. Necker.

Worte sind der Seele Bild--Words are the soul's
magic. Goethe.

Worte sind gut, wenn Werke folgen--Words
are good if works follow. Ger. Pr.

Worth makes the man, and want of it the
fellow; / The rest is all but leather or prunello.
Pope.

Worth many thousand is the first salute; /                          20
Him that salutes thee, therefore, friendly
greet. Goethe.

Worthless people live only to eat and drink;
people of worth eat and drink only to live.
Socrates.

Would they could sell us experience, though
at diamond prices, but then no one would
use the article second-hand! Balzac.

Would we but pledge ourselves to truth as
heartily as we do to a real or imaginary
mistress, and think life too short only because
it abridges our time of service, what
a new world we should have! Lowell.

Would we but quit ourselves like men, and
resolutely stand our ground, we should not
fail of succours from above. Thomas à
Kempis.

Would Wisdom for herself be wooed, / And                            25
wake the foolish from his dream, / She must
be glad as well as good, / And must not only
be, but seem. Coventry Patmore.

Would you have men think well of you, then
do not speak well of yourself. Pascal.

Wouldst thou a maiden make thy prize, /
Thyself alone the bribe must be. Goethe.

Wouldst thou both eat thy cake and have it?
George Herbert.

Wouldst thou know thyself, then see how
others act; wouldst thou understand others,
look thou into thine own heart. Schiller.

Wouldst thou plant for eternity? then plant                         30
into the deep infinite faculties of man, his
fantasy and heart. Wouldst thou plant for
year and day? then plant into his shallow
superficial faculties, his self-love and arithmetical
understanding, what will grow there.
Carlyle.

"Wouldst thou," so the helmsman answered, /
"Learn the secret of the sea? / Only those
who brave its dangers / Comprehend its
mystery!" Longfellow.

Wouldst thou subject all things to thyself?
Subject thyself to reason. Seneca.

Wouldst thou the life of souls discern? / Nor
human wisdom nor divine / Helps thee by
aught beside to learn; / Love is life's only
sign. Keble.

Wouldst thou travel the path of truth and
goodness? Never deceive either thyself or
others. Goethe.

Wounds and hardships provoke our courage,                           35
and when our fortunes are at the lowest, our
wits and minds are commonly at the best.
Charron.

Wounds cannot be cured without searching.
Bacon.

Wrap thyself up like a woodlouse, and dream
revenge. Congreve.

Write down the advice of him who loves
you, though you like it not at present.
Pr.

Write how you will, the critic shall show the
world you could have written better. Goldsmith.

Write, so much given to God; thou shalt be                          40
heard. George Herbert.

Write thy wrongs in ashes. Sir T. Browne.

Writers of novels and romances in general
bring a double loss on their readers--they
rob them both of their time and money; representing
men, manners, and things, that never
have been, nor are likely to be; either confounding
or perverting history and truth,
inflating the mind, or committing violence
upon the understanding. Mary Wortley
Montagu.

Writing is not literature unless it gives to the
reader a pleasure which arises not only from
the things said, but from the way in which
they are said; and that pleasure is only given
when the words are carefully or curiously
or beautifully put together into sentences.
Stopford Brooke.

Written all of it (Christianity) in us already in
sympathetic ink. Bible awakens it, and you
can read. Dr. Chalmers to Carlyle in conversation.

Wrong is not only different from right, but it
is in strict scientific terms infinitely different.
Carlyle.

Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt
never is. Our pride remembers it for ever.
It implies a discovery of weaknesses, which
we are much more careful to conceal than
crimes. Many a man will confess his crimes
to a common friend, but I never knew a man
who would tell his silly weaknesses to his
most intimate one. Chesterfield.

Würf er einen Groschen auf's Dach, fiel ihm                          5
ein Thaler herunter--If he threw a penny up,
a dollar came down. Ger. Pr.

Ye may darken over the blue heavens, ye

Beyond the howling of that wrath, beyond

paradise restored. Mrs. Gatty.

Ye men of gloom and austerity, who paint the                        20
face of Infinite Benevolence with an eternal
frown, read in the everlasting book, wide
open to your view, the lesson it would teach.
Its pictures are not in black and sombre
hues, but bright and glowing tints; its
music--save when ye drown it--is not in
sighs and groans, but songs and cheerful
sounds. Listen to the million voices in the
summer air, and find one dismal as your
own. Dickens.

Ye shall know them by their fruits. Jesus.

Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven!...
In our aspirations to be great, / Our destinies
o'erleap their mortal state, / And claim a

reverence from afar, / That fortune, fame,
power, life, have named themselves a star.
Byron.

Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg / The
murmur of the world. Tennyson.

Ye'll find mankind an unco squad, / And
muckle they may grieve ye. Burns.

Yea, let all good things await / Him who cares                      25
not to be great, / But as he saves or serves
the state. Tennyson.

Yea, surely the sea like a harper laid hand
on the shore as a lyre. Swinburne.

Year chases year, decay pursues decay, / Still

Johnson.

Years do not make sages; they only make
old men. Mme. Swetchine.

Years following years steal something every
day; / At last they steal us from ourselves
away. Pope.

from the limb, / And life's enchanted cup
but sparkles near the brim. Byron.

Yes, there are things we must dream and
dare, / And execute ere thought be half
aware. Byron.

Yes, you find people ready enough to do the
good Samaritan without the oil and twopence.
Sydney Smith.

Yet a little while, and we shall all meet there,
and our Mother's bosom will screen us all;
and Oppression's harness, and Sorrow's fire-whip,
and all the Gehenna bailiffs that
patrol and inhabit ever-vexed Time, cannot
harm us any more. Carlyle.

Yet all that poets sing, and grief hath known, /
Of hopes laid waste, knells in that word--Alone.
Bulwer Lytton.

Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd, /                       35

Lear, iv. 1.

Yet do I fear thy nature; / It is too full o' the
milk o' human kindness. Macb., i. 5.

Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing
purpose runs, / And the thoughts of men
are widen'd by the process of the suns.
Tennyson.

Yet I've heard say, by wise men in my day, /
That none are outwitted so easy as they /
Who reckon with all men as if they suspect
them, / And traffic in caution, and watch to
detect them. Dr. W. Smith.

Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide, /
The Scripture assures us the Lord will provide.
Newton.

Yet taught by Time, my heart has learned to
glow / For other's good and melt at other's
woe. Pope.

Yet there are surely times when there is
nought / So needed as unsettling, just to

Yield to God's word and will, and you will
escape many a calamity. Spurgeon.

Yielding is sometimes the best way of succeeding.

Yielding, timid weakness is always abused and
insulted by the unjust and unfeeling; but
meekness, when sustained by the "fortiter
in re," is always respected, commonly successful.
Chesterfield.

You accuse woman of wavering affection.
Blame her not; she is but seeking a constant
man. Goethe.

You always aspire to very little at first, but                      10
as you mount the ladder, you are sure to
look down upon what you formerly looked
up to as the height of happiness. Brothers
Mayhew.

You always end ere you begin. Two Gent. of
Verona, ii. 4.

You are always willing enough to read lives,
but never willing to lead them. Ruskin.

You are not very good if you are not better
than your best friends imagine you to be.
Lavater.

You are obliged to your imagination for three-fourths               15

say, meaning the power or the caprice
thereof; but you are not beyond the power

You are to come to your study as to the table,
with a sharp appetite, whereby that which

You are transported by calamity / Thither
where more attends you. Coriolanus, i. 1.

You arrive at truth through poetry, and I
arrive at poetry through truth. Joubert.

Knock as you please, there's nobody at

Körner.

You can imagine thistle-down so light that
when you run after it your running motion

troubles, they, chasing, shall raise him higher
and higher. Ward Beecher.

You cannot abolish slavery by Act of Parliament,
but can only abolish the name of it,

You cannot fathom your mind. There is a well                        30

more you draw from it, the more clear and
fruitful it will be. G. A. Sala.

You cannot get anything out of Nature or from
God by gambling;--only out of your neighbour.
Ruskin.

You cannot have the ware and the money both
at once; and he who always hankers for the

him of the purchase when the ware is in his
hands. Goethe.

You cannot have your work well done if the
work be not of a right kind. Carlyle.

You cannot hide any secret. Emerson.

You cannot lead a fighting world without                            35
having it regimented, chivalried; nor can
you any more continue to lead a working
world unregimented, anarchic. Carlyle.

You cannot love the real sun, that is to say,
physical light and colour, rightly, unless you
love the spiritual sun, that is to say, justice
and truth, rightly. Ruskin.

You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's
ear. Pr.

You cannot push a man far up a tree. Pr.

You cannot put a quartern loaf into a child's
head; you must break it up, and give him

You cannot rear a temple like a hut of sticks                       40
and turf. Dr. W. Smith.

believe. Coleridge.

You do not educate a man by telling him what
he knew not, but by making him what he
was not, and what he will remain for ever.
Ruskin.

your carrots for their flowers. Now that's
the way you should choose women. George
Eliot.

You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant; /
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart /
Is true as steel; leave you your power to
draw, / And I shall have no power to follow
you. Mid. N.'s Dream, ii. 2.

You feel yourself an exile in the East; but in
the West too it is exile; I know not where
under the sun it is not exile. Carlyle to a
young friend.

You find faut wi' your meat, and the faut's                          5
all i' your own stomach. George Eliot.

You find yourself refreshed by the presence of
cheerful people. Why not make earnest
effort to confer that pleasure on others?
You will find half the battle is gained if you
never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.
Mrs. L. M. Child.

You frighten me out of my seven senses.
Swift.

You gazed at the moon and fell in the gutter.
Pr.

You give me nothing during your life, but you
promise to provide for me at your death.
If you are not a fool, you know what I

You have no hold on a human being whose
affections are without a tap-root! Southey.

You have not outgrown, you cannot outgrow,

Macb., iii. 2.

You have too much respect upon the world; /
They lose it that do buy it with much care.
Mer. of Ven., i. 1.

You knock a man into the ditch, and then you
tell him to remain content in the "position in
which Providence has placed him." Ruskin.

when afloat on the billows, though a cable
would hardly move her when pulled up on
the beach. Scott.

principal, nor is it my principle to pay the
interest. Sheridan to a creditor of his.

good for bad, blessings for curses. Rich.

You know not where a blessing may light. Pr.

You know that in everything women write
there are always a thousand faults of grammar,

You lie nearest to the river of life when you
bend to it. You cannot drink but as you
stoop. J. H. Evans.

You live one half year with deception and
art; / With art and deception you live
t'other part. It. Pr.

You make but a poor trap to catch luck if you                       25
go and bait it with wickedness. George
Eliot.

You may as soon separate weight from lead,
heat from fire, moistness from water, and
brightness from the sun, as misery, discontent,
calamity, and danger from man.
Burton.

You may as well ask a loom which weaves
huckaback why it does not make cashmere,
as expect poetry from this engineer, or a
chemical discovery from that jobber. Emerson.

You may depend upon it, religion is, in its

manners. Coleridge.

You may depend upon it that he is a good man
whose intimate friends are all good. Lavater.

words, are the most exquisite revenge for

where beauty is, than in anxiously inquiring

form, the outline of which no definition holds.

up to themselves. J. Boswell.

Your noblest natures are most credulous.
Chapman.

Your own soul is the thing you ought to look
after. Thomas à Kempis.

Your own words and actions are the only
things you will be called to account for.
Thomas à Kempis.

Your prime one need is to do right, under
whatever compulsion, till you can do it without
compulsion. And then you are a Man.

Youth beholds happiness gleaming in the prospect.
Age looks back on the happiness of
youth, and, instead of hopes, seeks its enjoyment

enjoy them. Rückert.

Youth ever thinks that good whose goodness

Youth fades; love droops; the leaves of friendship                  40
fall; a mother's secret hope outlives them

Youth holds no society with grief. Euripides.

Youth is a blunder; manhood, a struggle; old
age, a regret. Disraeli.

Youth is ever apt to judge in haste, and lose
the medium in the wild extreme. Aaron Hill.

Youth is ever confiding; and we can almost
forgive its disinclination to follow the counsels
of age, for the sake of the generous disdain
with which it rejects suspicion. W. H.
Harrison.

Youth is full of sport, age's breath is short; /                    45
Youth is nimble, age is lame: / Youth is hot

wild, and age is tame. Shakespeare.

Youth is not rich in time; it may be, poor;

can tell. Young.

Youth is not the age of pleasure; we then

have brought down our wishes to our experience,
then we become calm and begin
to enjoy ourselves. Lord Liverpool.

Youth is the season of credulity. Chatham.

age, if it will hit, / Shoots a bow short, and
lessens still his stake, / As the day lessens,
and his life with it. George Herbert.

livery that it wears, / Than settled age his
sables and his weeds, / Importing health and

Youth would rather be stimulated than instructed.
Goethe.

Youth, when thought is speech and speech
is truth. Scott.

Youth will never live to age, without they keep
themselves in breath with exercise, and in
heart with joyfulness. Too much thinking
doth consume the spirits; and oft it falls out,
that while one thinks too much of doing, he
leaves to do the effect of his thinking. Sir
P. Sidney.

Youthful failing is not to be admired except in
so far as one may hope that it will not be the
failing of old age. Goethe.

Handelnd erreicht der Glückliche sie, der
Leidende duldend; / Wohl ihm, den sein
Geschick liebend auf beiden geführt--There
are two roads on which man strives to virtue;
