PREFACE.

    "Out of the old fieldes cometh al this new corne fro yere to yere,"
     And out of the fresh woodes cometh al these new flowres here.


THE small thin volume, the first to bear the title of this collection,
after passing through eight editions, each enlarged, now culminates in
its ninth,--and with it, closes its tentative life.

This extract from the Preface of the fourth edition is applicable to the
present one:--

"It is not easy to determine in all cases the degree of familiarity that
may belong to phrases and sentences which present themselves for
admission; for what is familiar to one class of readers may be quite new
to another. Many maxims of the most famous writers of our language, and
numberless curious and happy turns from orators and poets, have knocked
at the door, and it was hard to deny them. But to admit these simply on
their own merits, without assurance that the general reader would readily
recognize them as old friends, was aside from the purpose of this
collection. Still, it has been thought better to incur the risk of erring
on the side of fulness."

With the many additions to the English writers, the present edition
contains selections from the French, and from the wit and wisdom of the
ancients. A few passages have been admitted without a claim to
familiarity, but solely on the ground of coincidence of thought.

I am under great obligations to M. H. MORGAN, Ph. D., of Harvard
University, for the translation of Marcus Aurelius, and for the
translation and selections from the Greek tragic writers. I am indebted
to the kindness of Mr. DANIEL W. WILDER, of Kansas, for the quotations
from Pilpay, with contributions from Diogenes Laertius, Montaigne,
Burton, and Pope's Homer; to Dr. WILLIAM J. ROLFE for quotations from
Robert Browning; to Mr. JAMES W. MCINTYRE for quotations from Coleridge,
Shelley, Keats, Mrs. Browning, Robert Browning, and Tennyson. And I have
incurred other obligations to friends for here a little and there a
little.

It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the great assistance I have received
from Mr. A. W. STEVENS, the accomplished reader of the University Press,
as this work was passing through the press.

In withdrawing from this very agreeable pursuit, I beg to offer my
sincere thanks to all who have assisted me either in the way of
suggestions or by contributions; and especially to those lovers of this
subsidiary literature for their kind appreciation of former editions.

Accepted by scholars as an authoritative book of reference, it has grown
with its growth in public estimation with each reissue. Of the last two
editions forty thousand copies were printed, apart from the English
reprints. The present enlargement of text equals three hundred and fifty
pages of the previous edition, and the index is increased with upwards of
ten thousand lines.

[15-8] Him that makes shoes go barefoot himself.--BURTON: _Anatomy
    of Melancholy. Democritus to the Reader._

[15-9] This phrase derives its origin from the custom of certain
    manors where tenants are authorized to take fire-bote _by hook or
    by crook_; that is, so much of the underwood as many be cut with a
    crook, and so much of the loose timber as may be collected from
    the boughs by means of a hook. One of the earliest citations of
    this proverb occurs in John Wycliffe's _Controversial Tracts,
    circa 1370_.--See Skelton, page 8. RABELAIS: _book v. chap. xiii._

    to Lucius._

    Lord Macaulay (_History of England, vol. i. chap. iii._) thinks
    that this proverb originated in the preference generally given to
    the gray mares of Flanders over the finest coach-horses of
    England. Macaulay, however, is writing of the latter half of the
    seventeenth century, while the proverb was used a century earlier.

    Fain would I, but I dare not; I dare, and yet I may not;

_Fain Would I._


    Passions are likened best to floods and streams:
    The shallow murmur, but the deep are dumb.[25-1]

_The Silent Lover._


    Go, Soul, the body's guest,
      Upon a thankless arrant:
    Fear not to touch the best,

    Even such is time, that takes in trust
    Our youth, our joys, our all we have,
    And pays us but with age and dust;
    Who in the dark and silent grave,
    When we have wandered all our ways,
    Shuts up the story of our days.
    But from this earth, this grave, this dust,
    My God shall raise me up, I trust!

    Cupid and my Campaspe play'd
    At cards for kisses: Cupid paid.
    He stakes his quiver, bow, and arrows,
    His mother's doves, and team of sparrows:
    Loses them too. Then down he throws
    The coral of his lip, the rose
    Growing on 's cheek (but none knows how);
    With these, the crystal of his brow,
    And then the dimple on his chin:
    All these did my Campaspe win.
    At last he set her both his eyes:
    She won, and Cupid blind did rise.
      O Love! has she done this to thee?
      What shall, alas! become of me?

    Herself the glory of a creditor,
    Both thanks and use.

    Are of imagination all compact:

    Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
    The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
    Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
    And as imagination bodies forth
    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
    Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
    A local habitation and a name.

    That if it would but apprehend some joy,
    It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
    Or in the night, imagining some fear,
    How easy is a bush supposed a bear!

_The Merchant of Venice. Act i. Sc. 1._

    The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
    In doing courtesies.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     Thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your
     mother.[64-2]

    What! wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    I am a tainted wether of the flock,
    Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
    Drops earliest to the ground.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    I never knew so young a body with so old a head.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
    Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
    'T is mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
    The throned monarch better than his crown;
    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
    The attribute to awe and majesty,
    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
    But mercy is above this sceptred sway,
    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
    It is an attribute to God himself;
    And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
    When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
    Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
    That in the course of justice none of us
    Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
    The deeds of mercy.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    Is it so nominated in the bond?[65-1]

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    'T is not in the bond.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    Speak me fair in death.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    An upright judge, a learned judge!

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
    Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    You take my house when you do take the prop
    That doth sustain my house; you take my life
    When you do take the means whereby I live.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    He is well paid that is well satisfied.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here we will sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
    There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.
    Such harmony is in immortal souls;
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._


    I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._


    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._


    How far that little candle throws his beams!
    So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._


    How many things by season season'd are
    To their right praise and true perfection!

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._


    This night methinks is but the daylight sick.

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._

_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
    Of starved people.

    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
    Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 1._

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    O, good old man, how well in thee appears
    The constant service of the antique world,
    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
    Where none will sweat but for promotion.

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 3._

    And then he drew a dial from his poke,
    And looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
    Says very wisely, "It is ten o'clock:
    Thus we may see," quoth he, "how the world wags."

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._


    And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
    And then from hour to hour we rot and rot;
    And thereby hangs a tale.[68-1]

    With observation, the which he vents
    In mangled forms.

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._

    The "why" is plain as way to parish church.

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._


    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
    If ever you have look'd on better days,
    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._


    True is it that we have seen better days.

                       All the world 's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players.[69-1]
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
    And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard;
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lined,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
    His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._

     It is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,

     of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most

    She sat like patience on a monument,
    Smiling at grief.

     flat: nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if
     they had gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of

     come on,--how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or an arm? no:
     or take away the grief of a wound? no. Honour hath no skill in
     surgery, then? no. What is honour? a word. What is in that word
     honour; what is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
     he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no. Doth he hear it?
     no. 'T is insensible, then? yea, to the dead. But will it not
     live with the living? no. Why? detraction will not suffer it.
     Therefore I 'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon. And so
     ends my catechism.

    Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
    Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
    The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
    With busy hammers closing rivets up,[92-1]
    Give dreadful note of preparation.

    Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.

     Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are
     alive at this day to testify it.

_King Henry VI. Part II. Act iv. Sc. 2._


     Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in
     erecting a grammar-school; and whereas, before, our forefathers
     had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused
     printing to be used, and, contrary to the king, his crown and
     dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill.

_King Henry VI. Part II. Act iv. Sc. 7._


    How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,
    Within whose circuit is Elysium

    A little fire is quickly trodden out;
    Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench.

_King Henry VI. Part III. Act iv. Sc. 8._


    Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
    The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

_King Henry VI. Part III. Act v. Sc. 6._


    Now is the winter of our discontent
    Made glorious summer by this sun of York,
    And all the clouds that loured upon our house
    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,
    Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
    Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;
    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
    But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
    I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty
    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
    I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,
    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
    Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time
    Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
    And that so lamely and unfashionable
    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them,--
    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
    Have no delight to pass away the time,
    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun.

_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 1._

    And thus I clothe my naked villany
    With old odd ends stolen out of[96-2] holy writ,
    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.

_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 3._


    O, I have passed a miserable night,
    So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
    I would not spend another such a night,
    Though 't were to buy a world of happy days.

_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
    What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
    What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
    Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
    Ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,
    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
    All scattered in the bottom of the sea:
    Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes
    Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
    As 't were in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems.

    Orpheus with his lute made trees,

_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    I have touched the highest point of all my greatness;
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
    And no man see me more.

_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Press not a falling man too far!

_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory,
    But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
    At length broke under me and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
    I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._

    Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
    A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.

_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._


      I charge thee, fling away ambition:
    By that sin fell the angels.

_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
    Corruption wins not more than honesty.
    Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
    To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
    Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
    Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,
    Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!

    The common curse of mankind,--folly and ignorance.

_Troilus and Cressida. Act ii. Sc. 3._

    That 's curdied by the frost from purest snow
    And hangs on Dian's temple.

_Coriolanus. Act v. Sc. 3._

    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._


    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you!
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep.

    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._


                   True, I talk of dreams,
    Which are the children of an idle brain,

    For you and I are past our dancing days.[105-1]

    Shall have the chinks.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[105-3]


    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[105-4]


    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[105-4]


    What 's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet.

    _Rom._ Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

    _Jul._ O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[106-2]


    The god of my idolatry.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[106-2]


    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say, "It lightens."

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[106-2]


    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[106-2]


    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[106-2]


    Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._[106-2]


    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give,
    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
    And vice sometimes by action dignified.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Stabbed with a white wench's black eye.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    The courageous captain of complements.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    One, two, and the third in your bosom.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    I am the very pink of courtesy.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


     A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will
     speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    My man 's as true as steel.[107-1]

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    These violent delights have violent ends.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 6._


    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 6._


    Here comes the lady! O, so light a foot
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 6._


     Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    A word and a blow.[107-2]

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    A plague o' both your houses!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


     _Rom._ Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

     _Mer._ No, 't is not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
     church-door; but 't is enough, 't will serve.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


                     When he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night,
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                             They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    The damned use that word in hell.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._


    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._


                        All these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._


    Villain and he be many miles asunder.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._


    Thank me no thanks, nor proud me no prouds.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._


    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    I do remember an apothecary,--
    And hereabouts he dwells.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


                      Meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    A beggarly account of empty boxes.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Famine is in thy cheeks.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    _Ap._ My poverty, but not my will, consents.

    _Rom._ I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


                  The strength
    Of twenty men.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book.

_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 3._


                         Her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.

_Romeo and Juliet, Act v. Sc. 3._


                      Beauty's ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

_Romeo and Juliet, Act v. Sc. 3._


                  Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace!

_Romeo and Juliet, Act v. Sc. 3._


    But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
    Leaving no tract behind.

_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 1._


     Here 's that which is too weak to be a sinner,--honest water,
     which ne'er left man i' the mire.

_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
    I pray for no man but myself;
    Grant I may never prove so fond,
    To trust man on his oath or bond.

_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Men shut their doors against a setting sun.

_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 2._


                                Every room
    Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy.

_Timon of Athens. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    'T is lack of kindly warmth.

_Timon of Athens. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Every man has his fault, and honesty is his.

_Timon of Athens. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

_Timon of Athens. Act iii. Sc. 5._


    We have seen better days.

_Timon of Athens. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    Are not within the leaf of pity writ.

_Timon of Athens. Act iv. Sc. 3._


          I 'll example you with thievery:
    The sun 's a thief, and with his great attraction
    Robs the vast sea; the moon 's an arrant thief,
    And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
    The sea 's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
    The moon into salt tears; the earth 's a thief,
    That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
    From general excrement: each thing 's a thief.

_Timon of Athens. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Life's uncertain voyage.

_Timon of Athens. Act v. Sc. 1._


    As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 1._


    The live-long day.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 1._


    Beware the ides of March.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Well, honour is the subject of my story.
    I cannot tell what you and other men
    Think of this life; but, for my single self,
    I had as lief not be as live to be
    In awe of such a thing as I myself.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


                         "Darest thou, Cassius, now
    Leap in with me into this angry flood,
    And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
    And bade him follow.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Help me, Cassius, or I sink!

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


          Ye gods, it doth amaze me
    A man of such a feeble temper should
    So get the start of the majestic world
    And bear the palm alone.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
    Like a Colossus, and we petty men
    Walk under his huge legs and peep about
    To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
    Men at some time are masters of their fates:
    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
    But in ourselves, that we are underlings.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


                         Conjure with 'em,--
    Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.
    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
    Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,
    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
    As easily as a king.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Let me have men about me that are fat,
    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


                        He reads much;
    He is a great observer, and he looks
    Quite through the deeds of men.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
    As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit
    That could be moved to smile at anything.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


    But, for my own part, it was Greek to me.

_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._


                        'T is a common proof,
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost[111-1] round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
    The Genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    A dish fit for the gods.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
    He says he does, being then most flattered.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


      With an angry wafture of your hand,
    Gave sign for me to leave you.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    You are my true and honourable wife,
    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops[112-1]
    That visit my sad heart.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
    Being so father'd and so husbanded?

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._


            These things are beyond all use,
    And I do fear them.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.

_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    _Cæs._ The ides of March are come.

    _Sooth._ Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    But I am constant as the northern star,
    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
    There is no fellow in the firmament.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Et tu, Brute!

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


                  How many ages hence
    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
    In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    The choice and master spirits of this age.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Though last, not least in love.[113-1]

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Cry "Havoc," and let slip the dogs of war.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._


     Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my cause, and be
     silent that you may hear.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     Not that I loved Cæsar less, but that I loved Rome more.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Who is here so base that would be a bondman?

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
    I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
    The evil that men do lives after them;
    The good is oft interred with their bones.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    For Brutus is an honourable man;
    So are they all, all honourable men.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept:
    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
    And men have lost their reason.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    But yesterday the word of Cæsar might
    Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
    And none so poor to do him reverence.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    See what a rent the envious Casca made.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    This was the most unkindest cut of all.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


                              Great Cæsar fell.
    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
    Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
    I am no orator, as Brutus is;
    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    I only speak right on.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


                       Put a tongue
    In every wound of Cæsar that should move
    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    When love begins to sicken and decay,
    It useth an enforced ceremony.
    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 2._


                            You yourself
    Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    The foremost man of all this world.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
    Than such a Roman.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
    Did I say "better"?

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
    That they pass by me as the idle wind,
    Which I respect not.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts:
    Dash him to pieces!

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


                         All his faults observed,
    Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    There is a tide in the affairs of men
    Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
    Omitted, all the voyage of their life
    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


      We must take the current when it serves,
    Or lose our ventures.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
    And nature must obey necessity.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    _Brutus._ Then I shall see thee again?

    _Ghost._ Ay, at Philippi.

    _Brutus._ Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.

_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
    And leave them honeyless.

_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
    If not, why then this parting was well made.

_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 1._


          O, that a man might know
    The end of this day's business ere it come!

_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 1._


    The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!

_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 3._


    This was the noblest Roman of them all.

_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 5._


    His life was gentle, and the elements
    So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up
    And say to all the world, "This was a man!"

_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 5._


    _1 W._ When shall we three meet again
                In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

    _2 W._ When the hurlyburly 's done,
                When the battle 's lost and won.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 1._


    Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 1._


    Banners flout the sky.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his pent-house lid.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Dwindle, peak, and pine.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


                        What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on 't?

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Stands not within the prospect of belief.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
    And these are of them.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


                        The insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
    Win us with honest trifles, to betray 's
    In deepest consequence.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


                       Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the use of nature. Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


                           Nothing is
    But what is not.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


    If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


                  Come what come may,
    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._


                  Nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been studied in his death
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
    As 't were a careless trifle.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 4._


                      There 's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 4._


    More is thy due than more than all can pay.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 4._


                    Yet do I fear thy nature;
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._


                       What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._


    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
    Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under 't.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Which shall to all our nights and days to come
    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._


    This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Unto our gentle senses.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 6._


                   The heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
    The air is delicate.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 6._


    If it were done when 't is done, then 't were well
    It were done quickly: if the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
    With his surcease success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We 'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgment here; that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught, return
    To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


                        Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off;
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,
    And falls on the other.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


                              I have bought
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


    Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"
    Like the poor cat i' the adage.[118-1]

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


    I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


                          Nor time nor place
    Did then adhere.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


    _Macb._ If we should fail?

    _Lady M._                  We fail!
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
    And we 'll not fail.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


    Memory, the warder of the brain.

_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._


                 There 's husbandry in heaven;
    Their candles are all out.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


                               Shut up
    In measureless content.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Is this a dagger which I see before me,
    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
    To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


                 Now o'er the one half-world
    Nature seems dead.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


                Thou sure and firm-set earth,
    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


                     The bell invites me.
    Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
    That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good-night.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[119-1]


                The attempt and not the deed
    Confounds us.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[119-1]


    I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
    Stuck in my throat.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[119-1]


    Methought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
    Macbeth does murder sleep!" the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
    Chief nourisher in life's feast.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[120-1]


    Infirm of purpose!

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[120-1]


                      'T is the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[120-1]


    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._[120-1]


    The labour we delight in physics pain.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


      Dire combustion and confused events
    New hatch'd to the woful time.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


                        Tongue nor heart
    Cannot conceive nor name thee!

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


    Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
    Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
    The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
    The life o' the building!

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vault to brag of.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


    Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
    Loyal and neutral, in a moment?

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


    There 's daggers in men's smiles.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._[120-2]


    A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
    Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 4._[120-3]


    Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
    Thine own life's means!

_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    I must become a borrower of the night
    For a dark hour or twain.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    _Mur._         We are men, my liege.

    _Mac._ Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._


                            I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
    That I would set my life on any chance,
    To mend it, or be rid on 't.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._


              Things without all remedy
    Should be without regard; what 's done is done.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


               Better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the torture of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well:
    Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can touch him further.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    In them Nature's copy 's not eterne.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    A deed of dreadful note.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
    Till thou applaud the deed.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Now spurs the lated traveller apace
    To gain the timely inn.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
    To saucy doubts and fears.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
    And health on both!

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Thou canst not say I did it; never shake
    Thy gory locks at me.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    The air-drawn dagger.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                     The time has been,
    That when the brains were out the man would die,
    And there an end; but now they rise again,
    With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
    And push us from our stools.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    I drink to the general joy o' the whole table.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
    Which thou dost glare with!

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                A thing of custom,--'t is no other;
    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                What man dare, I dare:
    Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger,--
    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
    Shall never tremble.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                  Hence, horrible shadow!
    Unreal mockery, hence!

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    You have displac'd the mirth, broke the good meeting,
    With most admir'd disorder.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                Can such things be,
    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
    Without our special wonder?

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Stand not upon the order of your going,
    But go at once.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    _Macb._             What is the night?

    _L. Macb._ Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                              I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
    Returning were as tedious as go o'er.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                         My little spirit, see,
    Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.

_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 5._


    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    Eye of newt and toe of frog,
    Wool of bat and tongue of dog.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
          Open, locks,
          Whoever knocks!

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    A deed without a name.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


          I 'll make assurance double sure,
    And take a bond of fate.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
    Come like shadows, so depart!

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    I 'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round.[123-1]

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    The weird sisters.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    The flighty purpose never is o'ertook,
    Unless the deed go with it.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._


                   When our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
    Uproar the universal peace, confound
    All unity on earth.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Stands Scotland where it did?

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    I cannot but remember such things were,
    That were most precious to me.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
    And braggart with my tongue.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    The night is long that never finds the day.

_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Out, damned spot! out, I say!

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard?

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._


     Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood
     in him?

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._


     All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
    I cannot taint with fear.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._


                      My way of life
    Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf;
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but in their stead
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._


    _Doct._            Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.

    _Macb._                        Cure her of that.
    Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,
    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
    Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
    And with some sweet oblivious antidote
    Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
    Which weighs upon the heart?

    _Doct._                      Therein the patient
    Must minister to himself.

    _Macb._ Throw physic to the dogs: I 'll none of it.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._


    I would applaud thee to the very echo,
    That should applaud again.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._


    Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
    The cry is still, "They come!" our castle's strength
    Will laugh a siege to scorn.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._


                            My fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in 't: I have supp'd full with horrors.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._


    To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time,
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life 's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more: it is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._


    I pull in resolution, and begin
    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
    That lies like truth: "Fear not, till Birnam wood
    Do come to Dunsinane."

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._


    I gin to be aweary of the sun.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._


                   Blow, wind! come, wrack!
    At least we 'll die with harness on our back.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._


    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 6._


    I bear a charmed life.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._[126-1]


    And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd,
    That palter with us in a double sense:
    That keep the word of promise to our ear
    And break it to our hope.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._[126-1]


    Live to be the show and gaze o' the time.

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._[126-1]


                      Lay on, Macduff,
    And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"

_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._[126-1]


    For this relief much thanks: 't is bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


                             Whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


                              This sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir[127-1] abroad;
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.[127-2]

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._


    The memory be green.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,[127-3]
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    The head is not more native to the heart.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    A little more than kin, and less than kind.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


                 All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not "seems."
    'T is not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    But I have that within which passeth show;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


                     'T is a fault to Heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    That it should come to this!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


                  Why, she would hang on him,
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Frailty, thy name is woman!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    A little month.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Like Niobe, all tears.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    A beast, that wants discourse of reason.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    It is not nor it cannot come to good.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    In my mind's eye, Horatio.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    He was a man, take him for all in all,
    I shall not look upon his like again.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Season your admiration for a while.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    In the dead vast and middle of the night.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Arm'd at point exactly, cap-a-pe.[128-1]

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    _Ham._ His beard was grizzled,--no?

    _Hor._ It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Let it be tenable in your silence still.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Gave it an understanding, but no tongue.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


                   Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._


    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.[129-1]

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Give thy thoughts no tongue.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops[129-2] of steel.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


                                 Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear 't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all: to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Springes to catch woodcocks.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._


    _Ham._ The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

    _Hor._ It is a nipping and an eager air.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honoured in the breach than the observance.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee: I 'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous,[131-1] and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


    I do not set my life at a pin's fee.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


                     My fate cries out,
    And makes each petty artery in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


                     Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I 'll make a ghost of him that lets me!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._


                   I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,[131-2]
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
    And each particular hair to stand an end,
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:[131-3]
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That roots itself[131-4] in ease on Lethe wharf.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


                     O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhousell'd, disappointed, unaneled,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


                           Leave her to heaven
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


                 While memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I 'll wipe away all trivial fond records.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Within the book and volume of my brain.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain:
    At least I 'm sure it may be so in Denmark.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    _Ham._ There 's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he 's an arrant knave.

    _Hor._ There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


        Every man has business and desire,
    Such as it is.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


               Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right!

_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._


    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    This is the very ecstasy of love.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Brevity is the soul of wit.[133-1]

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    More matter, with less art.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    That he is mad, 't is true: 't is true 't is pity;
    And pity 't is 't is true.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


            Find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Doubt thou the stars are fire;
      Doubt that the sun doth move;
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
      But never doubt I love.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     To be honest as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of
     ten thousand.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Still harping on my daughter.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?

    _Ham._ Words, words, words.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    They have a plentiful lack of wit.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    A dream itself is but a shadow.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     This goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;
     this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
     o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden
     fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and
     pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man!
     how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving
     how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in
     apprehension how like a god!

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Man delights not me: no, nor woman neither.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could
     find it out.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    I know a hawk from a handsaw.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    One fair daughter and no more,
    The which he loved passing well.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Come, give us a taste of your quality.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     The play, I remember, pleased not the million; 't was caviare to
     the general.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     They are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after
     your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill
     report while you live.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     Use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    What 's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her?

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


                   Unpack my heart with words,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ.[135-1]

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


                 The devil hath power
    To assume a pleasing shape.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Abuses me to damn me.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


                      The play 's the thing
    Wherein I 'll catch the conscience of the king.

_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._


                      With devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The devil himself.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


      To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    Whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep:
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to,--'t is a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there 's the rub:
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause: there 's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life;
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels[136-1] bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And lose the name of action.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


                   Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins remember'd.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    I am myself indifferent honest.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


     Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
     calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


     I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given
     you one face, and you make yourselves another.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's eye, tongue, sword.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    The observed of all observers!

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


                                   O, woe is me,
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._


     Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
     gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the
     whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance
     that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul to
     hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters,
     to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the
     most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and
     noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
     Termagant; it out-herods Herod.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this
     special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    To hold, as 't were, the mirror up to nature.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     The very age and body of the time his form and pressure.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     Though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
     grieve.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Not to speak it profanely.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not
     made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    _First Play._ We have reformed that indifferently with
    us, sir.

    _Ham._ O, reform it altogether.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


      They are not a pipe for fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee.--Something too much of this.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Here 's metal more attractive.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I 'll have a suit of
     sables.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     There 's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a
     year.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    This is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    _Ham._ Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

    _Oph._ 'T is brief, my lord.

    _Ham._ As woman's love.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Our wills and fates do so contrary run
    That our devices still are overthrown.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    The lady doth protest[138-1] too much, methinks.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    The story is extant, and writ in choice Italian.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
      The hart ungalled play;
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
      So runs the world away.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    'T is as easy as lying.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    It will discourse most eloquent music.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Pluck out the heart of my mystery.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     _Ham._ Do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a
     camel?

     _Pol._ By the mass, and 't is like a camel, indeed.

     _Ham._ Methinks it is like a weasel.

     _Pol._ It is backed like a weasel.

     _Ham._ Or like a whale?

     _Pol._ Very like a whale.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    They fool me to the top of my bent.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    By and by is easily said.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    'T is now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't,
    A brother's murder.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


           Like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                           'T is not so above;
    There is no shuffling, there the action lies
    In his true nature.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay!
    Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                       About some act
    That has no relish of salvation in 't.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Dead, for a ducat, dead!

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
    If it be made of penetrable stuff.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                           Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    False as dicers' oaths.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    A rhapsody of words.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                                    What act
    That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See, what a grace was seated on this brow:
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,--
    A combination and a form indeed,
    Where every god did seem to set his seal,
    To give the world assurance of a man.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                             At your age
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it 's humble.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellions hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
    And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
    And put it in his pocket!

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    A king of shreds and patches.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                      How is 't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy?

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    This is the very coinage of your brain:
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                       Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will re-word; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what 's past; avoid what is to come.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                        Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    I must be cruel, only to be kind:
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    For 't is the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar.

_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                 Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are relieved,
    Or not at all.[141-1]

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 3._


     A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of
     the fish that hath fed of that worm.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unused.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 4._


                      Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour 's at the stake.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 4._


    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    We know what we are, but know not what we may be.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
    All in the morning betime.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    Come, my coach! Good night, sweet ladies; good night.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
    But in battalions.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    There 's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    That treason can but peep to what it would.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    Nature is fine in love, and where 't is fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


     There 's rosemary, that 's for remembrance; . . . and there is
     pansies, that 's for thoughts.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


     You must wear your rue with a difference. There 's a daisy; I
     would give you some violets, but they withered.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    His beard was as white as snow,
    All flaxen was his poll.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._


    A very riband in the cap of youth.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._


                        That we would do,
    We should do when we would.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._


    One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow.[143-1]

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._


                 Nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will.

_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._


     _1 Clo._ Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens
     not his own life.

     _2 Clo._ But is this law?

     _1 Clo._ Ay, marry, is 't; crowner's quest law.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._

     Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     A politician, . . . one that would circumvent God.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his
     quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his
     tricks?

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she 's dead.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or
     equivocation will undo us.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so
     near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite
     jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a
     thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my
     gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
     not how oft. Where be your gibes now; your gambols, your songs?
     your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a
     roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen?
     Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an
     inch thick, to this favour she must come.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


     To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination
     trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it stopping a
     bung-hole?

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    'T were to consider too curiously, to consider so.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Imperious Cæsar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


                   Lay her i' the earth:
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring![144-1]

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    A ministering angel shall my sister be.[144-2]

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Sweets to the sweet: farewell!

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


        Though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I something in me dangerous.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


                       Forty thousand brothers
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,
    Make up my sum.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._


                      Nay, an thou 'lt mouth,
    I 'll rant as well as thou.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._

    There 's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will.[145-1]

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    It did me yeoman's service.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


           The bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a towering passion.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


     The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry
     cannon by our sides.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    'T is the breathing time of day with me.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


     There 's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be
     now, 't is not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if
     it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. Since no
     man has aught of what he leaves, what is 't to leave betimes?

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


       I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    And hurt my brother.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Now the king drinks to Hamlet.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    A hit, a very palpable hit.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


                        This fell sergeant, death,
    Is strict in his arrest.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Report me and my cause aright.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Absent thee from felicity awhile.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    The rest is silence.

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Although the last, not least.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._


    Nothing will come of nothing.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._


                     Mend your speech a little,
    Lest it may mar your fortunes.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._


          I want that glib and oily art,
    To speak and purpose not.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._


    A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
    As I am glad I have not.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._


    Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides.

     That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in; and the
     best of me is diligence.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend!

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 4._


    How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
    To have a thankless child!

    Striving to better, oft we mar what 's well.

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 4._

    Thy element 's below.

    Of her confine.

    Necessity's sharp pinch!

_King Lear. Act ii. Sc. 4._


      Let not women's weapons, water-drops,
    Stain my man's cheeks!

_King Lear. Act ii. Sc. 4._


    Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._


     There was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._


                   Tremble, thou wretch,
    That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
    Unwhipp'd of justice.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._


                                I am a man
    More sinn'd against than sinning.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Oh, that way madness lies; let me shun that.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
    That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
    How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
    Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you
    From seasons such as these?

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                      Take physic, pomp;
    Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel.

_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    Out-paramoured the Turk.

                    Patience and sorrow strove
    Who should express her goodliest.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 3._


                          Half way down
    Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
    Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
    The fishermen that walk upon the beach
    Appear like mice.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._


    Nature 's above art in that respect.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._


    Ay, every inch a king.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._


     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
     imagination.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._


     A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine
     ears: see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
     thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice,
     which is the thief?

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._


    Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
    Robes and furr'd gowns hide all.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._


                     Mine enemy's dog,

    Pray you now, forget and forgive.

_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 7._


    Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
    The gods themselves throw incense.

_King Lear. Act v. Sc. 3._

    Nor the division of a battle knows.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._


    The bookish theoric.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._


                'T is the curse of service,
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,
    And not by old gradation, where each second
    Stood heir to the first.

    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd.

    The wealthy curled darlings of our nation.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approv'd good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her:
    The very head and front of my offending
    Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,[149-1]
    And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
    Of my whole course of love.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Her father loved me; oft invited me;
    Still question'd me the story of my life,
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have passed.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear[150-1]
    Would Desdemona seriously incline.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    And often did beguile her of her tears,
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 't was strange, 't was passing strange.
    'T was pitiful, 't was wondrous pitiful;
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That Heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    I do perceive here a divided duty.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
    My thrice-driven bed of down.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    I saw Othello's visage in his mind.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Put money in thy purse.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


     The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to
     him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    Framed to make women false.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._


    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    For I am nothing, if not critical.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    I am not merry; but I do beguile
    The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    She that was ever fair and never proud,
    Had tongue at will, and yet was never loud.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

      _Des._ To do what?

      _Iago._ To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

      _Des._ O most lame and impotent conclusion!

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


     You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    If after every tempest come such calms,
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Egregiously an ass.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Potations pottle-deep.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    King Stephen was a worthy peer,
      His breeches cost him but a crown;
    He held them sixpence all too dear,--
      With that he called the tailor lown.[152-1]

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
    From her propriety.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


                   Your name is great
    In mouths of wisest censure.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


                Cassio, I love thee;
    But never more be officer of mine.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    _Iago._ What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

    _Cas._ Ay, past all surgery.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


     Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost my
     reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what
     remains is bestial.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


     O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known
     by, let us call thee devil!

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


     O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
     their brains!

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


     _Cas._ Every inordinate cup is unbless'd, and the ingredient is a
     devil.

     _Iago._ Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it
     be well used.

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    How poor are they that have not patience!

_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
    But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
    Chaos is come again.[153-1]

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


            Speak to me as to thy thinkings,
    As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
    The worst of words.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
    Who steals my purse steals trash; 't is something, nothing;
    'T was mine, 't is his, and has been slave to thousands;
    But he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him
    And makes me poor indeed.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                 O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
    It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
    The meat it feeds on.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly[153-2] loves!

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Poor and content is rich and rich enough.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                    To be once in doubt
    Is once to be resolv'd.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,
    I 'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
    To prey at fortune.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                         I am declined
    Into the vale of years.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                 O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                  Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                  Not poppy, nor mandragora,
    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    Which thou owedst yesterday.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    I swear 't is better to be much abused
    Than but to know 't a little.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolen,
    Let him not know 't, and he 's not robb'd at all.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                      O, now, for ever
    Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
    Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
    That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
    Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
    The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
    The royal banner, and all quality,
    Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
    And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
    The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
    Farewell! Othello's occupation 's gone!

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                        No hinge nor loop
    To hang a doubt on.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    On horror's head horrors accumulate.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


               Take note, take note, O world,
    To be direct and honest is not safe.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    But this denoted a foregone conclusion.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                  Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
    For 't is of aspics' tongues!

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                     Like to the Pontic sea,
    Whose icy current and compulsive course
    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
    To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
    Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
    Till that a capable and wide revenge
    Swallow them up.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    Our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    To beguile many, and be beguil'd by one.

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    They laugh that win.[155-1]

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 1._


     But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    I understand a fury in your words,
    But not the words.

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips.

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._


                     But, alas, to make me
    A fixed figure for the time of scorn
    To point his slow unmoving finger[155-2] at!

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin.

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._


                            O thou weed,
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
    That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born.

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    O Heaven, that such companions thou 'ldst unfold,
    And put in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked through the world!

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    'T is neither here nor there.

_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    It makes us or it mars us.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Every way makes my gain.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._


    He hath a daily beauty in his life.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._


                         This is the night
    That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._


    And smooth as monumental alabaster.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Put out the light, and then put out the light:
    If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
    I can again thy former light restore
    Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
    Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
    I know not where is that Promethean heat
    That can thy light relume.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    So sweet was ne'er so fatal.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
    Had stomach for them all.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    One entire and perfect chrysolite.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Every puny whipster.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    I have done the state some service, and they know 't.
    No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
    When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
    Nor set down aught in malice. Then, must you speak
    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
    Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
    Albeit unused to the melting mood,
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
    Their medicinal gum.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
    And smote him, thus.

_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._


    There 's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 1._


                             On the sudden
    A Roman thought hath struck him.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 2._


    This grief is crowned with consolation.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Give me to drink mandragora.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._


    Where 's my serpent of old Nile?

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._


    A morsel for a monarch.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._


                         My salad days,
    When I was green in judgment.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._


                          Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Small to greater matters must give way.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
    Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold;
    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
    The water which they beat to follow faster,
    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
    It beggar'd all description.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 2._


    I have not kept my square; but that to come
    Shall all be done by the rule.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 3._


                         'T was merry when
    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
    Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
    With fervency drew up.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 5._


    Come, thou monarch of the vine,
    Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 7._


    Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
    Than gain which darkens him.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iii. Sc. 1._


                   He wears the rose
    Of youth upon him.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iii. Sc. 13._


                         Men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iii. Sc. 13._


    To business that we love we rise betime,
    And go to 't with delight.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 4._


    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 4._


    The shirt of Nessus is upon me.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 12._


    Sometime we see a cloud that 's dragonish;
    A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
    A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
    A forked mountain, or blue promontory
    With trees upon 't.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 14._


    That which is now a horse, even with a thought
    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
    As water is in water.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 14._


                         Since Cleopatra died,
    I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
    Detest my baseness.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 14._


    I am dying, Egypt, dying.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 15._


    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
    The soldier's pole is fallen.[159-1]

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 15._


    Let 's do it after the high Roman fashion.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 15._


                         For his bounty,
    There was no winter in 't; an autumn 't was
    That grew the more by reaping.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._


              If there be, or ever were, one such,
    It 's past the size of dreaming.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._


                       Mechanic slaves
    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._


                              I have
    Immortal longings in me.

_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._


    Lest the bargain should catch cold and starve.

_Cymbeline. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Hath his bellyful of fighting.

_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily.

_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 2._


     The most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned
     up ace.

_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
      And Phoebus 'gins arise,[159-2]
    His steeds to water at those springs
      On chaliced flowers that lies;
    And winking Mary-buds begin
      To ope their golden eyes:
    With everything that pretty is,
      My lady sweet, arise.

_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    As chaste as unsunn'd snow.

_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 5._


    Some griefs are medicinable.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                           So slippery that
    The fear 's as bad as falling.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 3._


    The game is up.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 3._


                     No, 't is slander,
    Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
    Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie
    All corners of the world.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                   Some jay of Italy,
    Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
    Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    It is no act of common passage, but
    A strain of rareness.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._


    I have not slept one wink.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                    Thou art all the comfort
    The gods will diet me with.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._


                              Weariness
    Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
    Finds the down pillow hard.

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 6._


                     An angel! or, if not,
    An earthly paragon!

_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 6._


    Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
    Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.

_Cymbeline. Act iv. Sc. 2._


                              And put
    My clouted brogues from off my feet.

_Cymbeline. Act iv. Sc. 2._


    Golden lads and girls all must,
    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

_Cymbeline. Act iv. Sc. 2._


                   O, never say hereafter
    But I am truest speaker. You call'd me brother
    When I was but your sister.

_Cymbeline. Act v. Sc. 5._


                       Like an arrow shot
    From a well-experienc'd archer hits the mark
    His eye doth level at.

_Pericles. Act i. Sc. 1._


     _3 Fish._ Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.

     _1 Fish._ Why, as men do a-land: the great ones eat up the little
     ones.

_Pericles. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear.

_Venus and Adonis. Line 145._


    For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
    And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.

_Venus and Adonis. Line 1019._


    The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light.

_Venus and Adonis. Line 1027._


    For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.

_Lucrece. Line 1006._


    Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
    Calls back the lovely April of her prime.

_Sonnet iii._


    And stretched metre of an antique song.

_Sonnet xvii._


    But thy eternal summer shall not fade.

_Sonnet xviii._


    The painful warrior famoused for fight,[161-1]
    After a thousand victories, once foil'd,
    Is from the books of honour razed quite,
    And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd.

_Sonnet xxv._


    When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
    I summon up remembrance of things past,
    I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
    And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste.

_Sonnet xxx._


    Full many a glorious morning have I seen.

_Sonnet xxxiii._


    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.

_Sonnet l._


    Like stones of worth, they thinly placed are,
    Or captain jewels in the carcanet.

_Sonnet lii._


    The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
    For that sweet odour which doth in it live.

_Sonnet liv._


    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
    Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme.

_Sonnet lv._


    Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
    But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
    How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
    Whose action is no stronger than a flower?

_Sonnet lxv._


    And art made tongue-tied by authority.

_Sonnet lxvi._


    And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
    And captive good attending captain ill.

_Sonnet lxvi._


    The ornament of beauty is suspect,
    A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.

_Sonnet lxx._


    That time of year thou may'st in me behold,
    When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
    Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,--
    Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

_Sonnet lxxiii._


    Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
    Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
    And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
    When all the breathers of this world are dead;
    You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

_Sonnet lxxxi._


    Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing.

_Sonnet lxxxvii._


          Do not drop in for an after-loss.
    Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
    Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
    Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
    To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.

_Sonnet xc._


    When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
    Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.

_Sonnet xcviii._


    Still constant is a wondrous excellence.

_Sonnet cv._


    And beauty, making beautiful old rhyme.

_Sonnet cvi._


                     My nature is subdu'd
    To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.

_Sonnet cxi._


    Let me not to the marriage of true minds
    Admit impediments: love is not love
    Which alters when it alteration finds.

_Sonnet cxvi._


    'T is better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
    When not to be receives reproach of being;
    And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd,
    Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.

_Sonnet cxxi._


    No, I am that I am, and they that level
    At my abuses reckon up their own.

_Sonnet cxxi._


    That full star that ushers in the even.

_Sonnet cxxxii._


    So on the tip of his subduing tongue
    All kinds of arguments and questions deep,
    All replication prompt, and reason strong,
    For his advantage still did wake and sleep.
    To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,
    He had the dialect and different skill,
    Catching all passion in his craft of will.

_A Lover's Complaint. Line 120._


    O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
    In the small orb of one particular tear.

_A Lover's Complaint. Line 288._


    Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.

_The Passionate Pilgrim. iii._


    Crabbed age and youth
    Cannot live together.

_The Passionate Pilgrim. viii._


    Have you not heard it said full oft,
    A woman's nay doth stand for naught?

_The Passionate Pilgrim. xiv._


    Cursed be he that moves my bones.

_Shakespeare's Epitaph._

FRANCIS BACON. 1561-1626.

(_Works: Spedding and Ellis_).

     I hold every man a debtor to his profession; from the which as
     men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit, so ought
     they of duty to endeavour themselves by way of amends to be a
     help and ornament thereunto.

_Maxims of the Law. Preface._


     Come home to men's business and bosoms.

_Dedication to the Essays, Edition 1625._


     No pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage-ground
     of truth.

_Of Truth._


     Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that
     natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the
     other.

_Of Death._


     Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more man's nature
     runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.

_Of Revenge._


     It was a high speech of Seneca (after the manner of the Stoics),
     that "The good things which belong to prosperity are to be
     wished, but the good things that belong to adversity are to be
     admired."

_Of Adversity._


     It is yet a higher speech of his than the other, "It is true
     greatness to have in one the frailty of a man and the security of
     a god."

_Of Adversity._


     Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the
     blessing of the New.

_Of Adversity._


     Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and adversity
     is not without comforts and hopes.

_Of Adversity._


     Virtue is like precious odours,--most fragrant when they are
     incensed or crushed.[165-1]

_Of Adversity._


     He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune;
     for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue
     or mischief.

_Of Marriage and Single Life._


     Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and
     old men's nurses.[165-2]

_Of Marriage and Single Life._


     Men in great place are thrice servants,--servants of the
     sovereign or state, servants of fame, and servants of business.

_Of Great Place._


     Mahomet made the people believe that he would call a hill to him,
     and from the top of it offer up his prayers for the observers of
     his law. The people assembled. Mahomet called the hill to come to
     him, again and again; and when the hill stood still he was never
     a whit abashed, but said, "If the hill will not come to Mahomet,
     Mahomet will go to the hill."

_Of Boldness._


     The desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall; the
     desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall.[165-3]

_Of Goodness._


     The remedy is worse than the disease.[165-4]

_Of Seditions._


     I had rather believe all the fables in the legends and the Talmud
     and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a
     mind.

_Of Atheism._


     A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in
     philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.[166-1]

_Of Atheism._


     Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the
     elder, a part of experience. He that travelleth into a country
     before he hath some entrance into the language, goeth to school,
     and not to travel.

_Of Travel._


     Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause good or evil
     times, and which have much veneration but no rest.[166-2]

_Of Empire._


     In things that a man would not be seen in himself, it is a point
     of cunning to borrow the name of the world; as to say, "The world
     says," or "There is a speech abroad."

_Of Cunning._


     There is a cunning which we in England call "the turning of the
     cat in the pan;" which is, when that which a man says to another,
     he lays it as if another had said it to him.

_Of Cunning._


     It is a good point of cunning for a man to shape the answer he
     would have in his own words and propositions, for it makes the
     other party stick the less.

_Of Cunning._


     It hath been an opinion that the French are wiser than they seem,
     and the Spaniards seem wiser than they are; but howsoever it be
     between nations, certainly it is so between man and man.

_Of Seeming Wise._


     There is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of physic. A man's own
     observation, what he finds good of and what he finds hurt of, is
     the best physic to preserve health.

_Of Regimen of Health._


     Discretion of speech is more than eloquence; and to speak
     agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good
     words or in good order.

_Of Discourse._


     Men's thoughts are much according to their inclination,[167-1]
     their discourse and speeches according to their learning and
     infused opinions.

_Of Custom and Education._


     Chiefly the mould of a man's fortune is in his own hands.[167-2]

_Of Fortune._


     If a man look sharply and attentively, he shall see Fortune; for
     though she is blind, she is not invisible.[167-3]

_Of Fortune._


     Young men are fitter to invent than to judge, fitter for
     execution than for counsel, and fitter for new projects than for
     settled business.

_Of Youth and Age._


     Virtue is like a rich stone,--best plain set.

_Of Beauty._


     God Almighty first planted a garden.[167-4]

_Of Gardens._


     And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air
     (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of music) than in the
     hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know
     what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.

_Of Gardens._


     Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few
     to be chewed and digested.

_Of Studies._


     Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an
     exact man.

_Of Studies._


     Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtile;
     natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able
     to contend.

_Of Studies._


     The greatest vicissitude of things amongst men is the vicissitude
     of sects and religions.[168-1]

_Of Vicissitude of Things._


     Books must follow sciences, and not sciences books.

_Proposition touching Amendment of Laws._


     Knowledge is power.--Nam et ipsa scientia potestas est.[168-2]

_Meditationes Sacræ. De Hæresibus._


     Whence we see spiders, flies, or ants entombed and preserved
     forever in amber, a more than royal tomb.[168-3]

_Historia Vitæ et Mortis; Sylva Sylvarum, Cent. i. Exper. 100._


     When you wander, as you often delight to do, you wander indeed,
     and give never such satisfaction as the curious time requires.
     This is not caused by any natural defect, but first for want of
     election, when you, having a large and fruitful mind, should not
     so much labour what to speak as to find what to leave unspoken.
     Rich soils are often to be weeded.

_Letter of Expostulation to Coke._


     "Antiquitas sæculi juventus mundi." These times are the ancient
     times, when the world is ancient, and not those which we account
     ancient _ordine retrogrado_, by a computation backward from
     ourselves.[169-1]

    POPE: _Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot, line 169._

[169-1] As in the little, so in the great world, reason will tell
    you that old age or antiquity is to be accounted by the farther
    distance from the beginning and the nearer approach to the
    end,--the times wherein we now live being in propriety of speech
    the most ancient since the world's creation.--GEORGE HAKEWILL: _An
    Apologie or Declaration of the Power and Providence of God in the
    Government of the World. London, 1627._

    For as old age is that period of life most remote from infancy,
    who does not see that old age in this universal man ought not to
    be sought in the times nearest his birth, but in those most remote
    from it?--PASCAL: _Preface to the Treatise on Vacuum._

    It is worthy of remark that a thought which is often quoted from
    Francis Bacon occurs in [Giordano] Bruno's "Cena di Cenere,"
    published in 1584: I mean the notion that the later times are more
    aged than the earlier.--WHEWELL: _Philosophy of the Inductive
    Sciences, vol. ii. p. 198. London, 1847._

    Truth is as impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the
    sunbeam.--MILTON: _The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce._

[170-1] Cleanliness is indeed next to godliness.--JOHN WESLEY
    (quoted): _Journal, Feb. 12, 1772._

    According to Dr. A. S. Bettelheim, rabbi, this is found in the
    Hebrew fathers. He cites Phinehas ben Yair, as follows: "The
    doctrines of religion are resolved into carefulness; carefulness
    into vigorousness; vigorousness into guiltlessness; guiltlessness
    into abstemiousness; abstemiousness into cleanliness; cleanliness
    into godliness,"--literally, next to godliness.

[170-2] Whose life is a bubble, and in length a span.--BROWNE:
    _Pastoral ii._

    Our life is but a span.--_New England Primer._

[170-3] This line frequently occurs in almost exactly the same
    shape among the minor poems of the time: "Not to be born, or,
    being born, to die."--DRUMMOND: _Poems, p. 44._ BISHOP KING:
    _Poems, etc._ (1657), _p. 145._

[170-4] Tall men are like houses of four stories, wherein commonly
    the uppermost room is worst furnished.--HOWELL (quoted): _Letter
    i. book i. sect. ii._ (_1621._)

    Often the cockloft is empty in those whom Nature hath built many
    stories high.--FULLER: _Andronicus, sect. vi. par. 18, 1._

    Such as take lodgings in a head
    That 's to be let unfurnished.

    BUTLER: _Hudibras, part i. canto i. line 161._

[171-1] The custom is not altogether obsolete in the U. S. A.

[171-2] Is not old wine wholesomest, old pippins toothsomest, old
    wood burns brightest, old linen wash whitest? Old soldiers,
    sweetheart, are surest, and old lovers are soundest.--WEBSTER:
    _Westward Hoe, act ii. sc. 2._

    Old friends are best. King James used to call for his old shoes;
    they were easiest for his feet.--SELDEN: _Table Talk. Friends._

    Old wood to burn! Old wine to drink! Old friends to trust! Old
    authors to read!--Alonso of Aragon was wont to say in commendation
    of age, that age appeared to be best in these four
    things.--MELCHIOR: _Floresta Española de Apothegmas o sentencias,
    etc., ii. 1, 20._

    What find you better or more honourable than age? Take the
    preheminence of it in everything,--in an old friend, in old wine,
    in an old pedigree.--SHAKERLEY MARMION (1602-1639): _The
    Antiquary._

    I love everything that 's old,--old friends, old times, old

    Much like a subtle spider which doth sit

[176-1]
    Our souls sit close and silently within,

[176-2] 'T is just like a summer bird-cage in a garden: the birds
    that are without despair to get in, and the birds that are within
    despair and are in a consumption for fear they shall never get

    Le mariage est comme une forteresse assiégée: ceux qui sont dehors

    (Marriage is like a beleaguered fortress: those who are outside
    want to get in, and those inside want to get out).--QUITARD:

     Equity is a roguish thing. For Law we have a measure, know what
     to trust to; Equity is according to the conscience of him that
     is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is Equity.
     'T is all one as if they should make the standard for the measure
     we call a "foot" a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure
     would this be! One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short
     foot, a third an indifferent foot. 'T is the same thing in the
     Chancellor's conscience.

    On the wings of borrowed wit.

_The Shepherd's Hunting._


    And I oft have heard defended,--
    Little said is soonest mended.

_The Shepherd's Hunting._


    And he that gives us in these days
    New Lords may give us new laws.

     For words are wise men's counters,--they do but reckon by them;
     but they are the money of fools.

_The Leviathan. Part i. Chap. iv._


     No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all,
     continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man
     solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

    He that loves a rosy cheek,

    As old Time makes these decay,
    So his flames must waste away.

ROBERT HERRICK. 1591-1674.

    Cherry ripe, ripe, ripe, I cry,
    Full and fair ones,--come and buy!
    If so be you ask me where
    They do grow, I answer, there,
    Where my Julia's lips do smile,--
    There 's the land, or cherry-isle.

_Cherry Ripe._


    Some asked me where the rubies grew,
      And nothing I did say;
    But with my finger pointed to
      The lips of Julia.

_The Rock of Rubies, and the Quarrie of Pearls._


    Some asked how pearls did grow, and where?
      Then spoke I to my girl
    To part her lips, and showed them there
      The quarelets of pearl.

_The Rock of Rubies, and the Quarrie of Pearls._


    A sweet disorder in the dress
    Kindles in clothes a wantonness.

_Delight in Disorder._


    A winning wave, deserving note,
    In the tempestuous petticoat;
    A careless shoe-string, in whose tie
    I see a wild civility,--
    Do more bewitch me than when art
    Is too precise in every part.

_Delight in Disorder._


    You say to me-wards your affection 's strong;
    Pray love me little, so you love me long.[202-1]

_Love me Little, Love me Long._


    Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
      Old Time is still a-flying,

IZAAK WALTON. 1593-1683.

     Of which, if thou be a severe, sour-complexioned man, then I here
     disallow thee to be a competent judge.

_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._


     Angling may be said to be so like the mathematics that it can
     never be fully learnt.

_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._


     As no man is born an artist, so no man is born an angler.

_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._


     I shall stay him no longer than to wish him a rainy evening to
     read this following discourse; and that if he be an honest
     angler, the east wind may never blow when he goes a fishing.

_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._


     As the Italians say, Good company in a journey makes the way to
     seem the shorter.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     I am, sir, a Brother of the Angle.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     It [angling] deserves commendations; . . . it is an art worthy
     the knowledge and practice of a wise man.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     Angling is somewhat like poetry,--men are to be born so.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     Doubt not but angling will prove to be so pleasant that it will
     prove to be, like virtue, a reward to itself.[207-1]

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     Sir Henry Wotton was a most dear lover and a frequent practiser
     of the Art of Angling; of which he would say, "'T was an
     employment for his idle time, which was then not idly spent, a
     rest to his mind, a cheerer of his spirits, a diverter of
     sadness, a calmer of unquiet thoughts, a moderator of passions, a
     procurer of contentedness;" and "that it begat habits of peace
     and patience in those that professed and practised it."

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     You will find angling to be like the virtue of humility, which
     has a calmness of spirit and a world of other blessings attending
     upon it.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._


     I remember that a wise friend of mine did usually say, "That
     which is everybody's business is nobody's business."

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. ii._


     Good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. ii._


     An excellent angler, and now with God.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. iv._


     Old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. iv._


     No man can lose what he never had.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. v._


     We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler[208-1] said of strawberries:
     "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God
     never did;" and so, if I might be judge, God never did make a
     more calm, quiet, innocent recreation than angling.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. v._


     Thus use your frog: put your hook--I mean the arming
     wire--through his mouth and out at his gills, and then with a
     fine needle and silk sew the upper part of his leg with only one
     stitch to the arming wire of your hook, or tie the frog's leg
     above the upper joint to the armed wire; and in so doing use him
     as though you loved him.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 8._


     This dish of meat is too good for any but anglers, or very honest
     men.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 8._


     Health is the second blessing that we mortals are capable of,--a
     blessing that money cannot buy.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 21._


     And upon all that are lovers of virtue, and dare trust in his
     Providence, and be quiet and go a-angling.

_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 21._


     But God, who is able to prevail, wrestled with him; marked him
     for his own.[208-2]

    And that which was before come after.
    But those that write in rhyme still make
    The one verse for the other's sake;
    For one for sense, and one for rhyme,
    I think 's sufficient at one time.

    So in the Libyan fable it is told

    Are we now smitten."

    So the struck eagle, stretch'd upon the plain,

    And wing'd the shaft that quiver'd in his heart.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 292._


    Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
    In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades
    High over-arch'd imbower.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 302._


    Awake, arise, or be forever fallen!

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 330._


               Spirits when they please
    Can either sex assume, or both.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 423._


    Execute their airy purposes.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 430._


                           When night
    Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons
    Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 500._


    Th' imperial ensign, which full high advanc'd
    Shone like a meteor, streaming to the wind.[224-2]

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 536._


    Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:
    At which the universal host up sent
    A shout that tore hell's concave, and beyond
    Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 540._


                             Anon they move
    In perfect phalanx, to the Dorian mood
    Of flutes and soft recorders.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 549._


                    His form had yet not lost
    All her original brightness, nor appear'd
    Less than archangel ruin'd, and th' excess
    Of glory obscur'd.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 591._


    In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds
    On half the nations, and with fear of change
    Perplexes monarchs.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 597._


    Thrice he assay'd, and thrice in spite of scorn
    Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 619._


                               Who overcomes
    By force, hath overcome but half his foe.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 648._


    Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell
    From heaven; for ev'n in heaven his looks and thoughts
    Were always downward bent, admiring more
    The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold,
    Than aught divine or holy else enjoy'd
    In vision beatific.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 679._


                               Let none admire
    That riches grow in hell: that soil may best
    Deserve the precious bane.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 690._


    Anon out of the earth a fabric huge
    Rose, like an exhalation.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 710._


                            From morn
    To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,--
    A summer's day; and with the setting sun
    Dropp'd from the Zenith like a falling star.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 742._


                         Fairy elves,
    Whose midnight revels by a forest side
    Or fountain some belated peasant sees,
    Or dreams he sees, while overhead the moon
    Sits arbitress.

_Paradise Lost. Book i. Line 781._


    High on a throne of royal state, which far
    Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
    Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
    Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,
    Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd
    To that bad eminence.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 1._


    Surer to prosper than prosperity
    Could have assur'd us.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 39._


           The strongest and the fiercest spirit
    That fought in heaven, now fiercer by despair.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 44._


                  Rather than be less,
    Car'd not to be at all.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 47._


    My sentence is for open war.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 51._


    That in our proper motion we ascend
    Up to our native seat: descent and fall
    To us is adverse.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 75._


                      When the scourge
    Inexorable and the torturing hour
    Call us to penance.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 90._


    Which, if not victory, is yet revenge.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 105._


    But all was false and hollow; though his tongue
    Dropp'd manna, and could make the worse appear
    The better reason,[226-1] to perplex and dash
    Maturest counsels.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 112._


                        Th' ethereal mould
    Incapable of stain would soon expel
    Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,
    Victorious. Thus repuls'd, our final hope
    Is flat despair.[226-2]

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 139._


                     For who would lose,
    Though full of pain, this intellectual being,
    Those thoughts that wander through eternity,
    To perish rather, swallow'd up and lost
    In the wide womb of uncreated night?

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 146._


    His red right hand.[227-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 174._


    Unrespited, unpitied, unrepriev'd.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 185._


             The never-ending flight
    Of future days.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 221._


    Our torments also may in length of time
    Become our elements.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 274._


                             With grave
    Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd
    A pillar of state; deep on his front engraven
    Deliberation sat, and public care;
    And princely counsel in his face yet shone,
    Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood,
    With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear
    The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look
    Drew audience and attention still as night
    Or summer's noontide air.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 300._


    The palpable obscure.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 406._


                     Long is the way
    And hard, that out of hell leads up to light.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 432._


    Their rising all at once was as the sound
    Of thunder heard remote.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 476._


                  The low'ring element
    Scowls o'er the darken'd landscape.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 490._


    Oh, shame to men! devil with devil damn'd
    Firm concord holds, men only disagree
    Of creatures rational.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 496._


                 In discourse more sweet;
    For eloquence the soul, song charms the sense.
    Others apart sat on a hill retir'd,
    In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high
    Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,
    Fix'd fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute;
    And found no end, in wand'ring mazes lost.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 555._


    Vain wisdom all and false philosophy.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 565._


                   Arm th' obdur'd breast
    With stubborn patience as with triple steel.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 568._


    A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
    Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
    Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air
    Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.
    Thither by harpy-footed Furies hal'd,
    At certain revolutions all the damn'd
    Are brought, and feel by turns the bitter change
    Of fierce extremes,--extremes by change more fierce;
    From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
    Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine
    Immovable, infix'd, and frozen round,
    Periods of time; thence hurried back to fire.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 592._


    O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,
    Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 620._


    Gorgons and Hydras and Chimæras dire.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 628._


                           The other shape,
    If shape it might be call'd that shape had none
    Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;
    Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,
    For each seem'd either,--black it stood as night,
    Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell,
    And shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head
    The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
    Satan was now at hand.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 666._


    Whence and what art thou, execrable shape?

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 681._


                      Back to thy punishment,
    False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 699._


    So spake the grisly Terror.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 704._


    Incens'd with indignation Satan stood
    Unterrify'd, and like a comet burn'd
    That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
    In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
    Shakes pestilence and war.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 707._


                        Their fatal hands
    No second stroke intend.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 712._


                            Hell
    Grew darker at their frown.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 719._


              I fled, and cry'd out, DEATH!
    Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh'd
    From all her caves, and back resounded, DEATH!

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 787._


    Before mine eyes in opposition sits
    Grim Death, my son and foe.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 803._


                                    Death
    Grinn'd horrible a ghastly smile, to hear
    His famine should be fill'd.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 845._


                    On a sudden open fly,
    With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,
    Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate
    Harsh thunder.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 879._


                       Where eldest Night
    And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold
    Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
    Of endless wars, and by confusion stand;
    For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four champions fierce,
    Strive here for mast'ry.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 894._


                        Into this wild abyss,
    The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 910._


                             To compare
    Great things with small.[230-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 921._


    O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
    With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,
    And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 948._


    With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
    Confusion worse confounded.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 995._


    So he with difficulty and labour hard
    Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour he.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 1021._


    And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
    This pendent world, in bigness as a star
    Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon.

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 1051._


    Hail holy light! offspring of heav'n first-born.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 1._


    The rising world of waters dark and deep.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 11._


                Thoughts that voluntary move
    Harmonious numbers.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 37._


                         Thus with the year
    Seasons return; but not to me returns
    Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
    Or sight of vernal bloom or summer's rose,
    Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
    But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
    Surrounds me; from the cheerful ways of men
    Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair
    Presented with a universal blank
    Of Nature's works, to me expung'd and raz'd,
    And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 40._


Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 99._


    See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
    With joy and love triumphing.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 337._


    Dark with excessive bright.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 380._


    Embryos and idiots, eremites and friars,
    White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.

                                 Since call'd
    The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 495._


    And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
    At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity
    Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
    Where no ill seems.

_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 686._


    The hell within him.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 20._


                Now conscience wakes despair
    That slumber'd,--wakes the bitter memory
    Of what he was, what is, and what must be
    Worse.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 23._


                 At whose sight all the stars
    Hide their diminish'd heads.[231-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 34._


                       A grateful mind
    By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
    Indebted and discharg'd.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 55._


                         Which way shall I fly
    Infinite wrath and infinite despair?
    Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell;
    And in the lowest deep a lower deep,
    Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,
    To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 73._


    Such joy ambition finds.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 92._


                          Ease would recant
    Vows made in pain, as violent and void.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 96._


    So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear,
    Farewell remorse; all good to me is lost.
    Evil, be thou my good.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 108._


    That practis'd falsehood under saintly shew,
    Deep malice to conceal, couch'd with revenge.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 122._


    Sabean odours from the spicy shore
    Of Araby the Blest.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 162._


            And on the Tree of Life,
    The middle tree and highest there that grew,
    Sat like a cormorant.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 194._


    A heaven on earth.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 208._


    Flowers worthy of paradise.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 241._


    Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose.[232-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 256._


                  Proserpine gathering flowers,
    Herself a fairer flower.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 269._


    For contemplation he and valour form'd,
    For softness she and sweet attractive grace;
    He for God only, she for God in him.
    His fair large front and eye sublime declar'd
    Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks
    Round from his parted forelock manly hung
    Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 297._


                                      Implied
    Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway,
    And by her yielded, by him best receiv'd,--
    Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,
    And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 307._


    Adam the goodliest man of men since born
    His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 323._


                          And with necessity,
    The tyrant's plea,[232-2] excus'd his devilish deeds.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 393._


                           As Jupiter
    On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds
    That shed May flowers.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 499._


    Imparadis'd in one another's arms.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 506._


                        Live while ye may,
    Yet happy pair.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 533._


    Now came still evening on, and twilight gray
    Had in her sober livery all things clad;
    Silence accompany'd; for beast and bird,
    They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
    Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
    She all night long her amorous descant sung;
    Silence was pleas'd. Now glow'd the firmament
    With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led
    The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
    Rising in clouded majesty, at length
    Apparent queen unveil'd her peerless light,
    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 598._


    The timely dew of sleep.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 614._


    With thee conversing I forget all time,
    All seasons, and their change,--all please alike.
    Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
    With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun
    When first on this delightful land he spreads
    His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
    Glist'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth
    After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
    Of grateful ev'ning mild; then silent night
    With this her solemn bird and this fair moon,
    And these the gems of heaven, her starry train:
    But neither breath of morn when she ascends
    With charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun
    On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flower,
    Glist'ring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,
    Nor grateful ev'ning mild, nor silent night
    With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon
    Or glittering starlight, without thee is sweet.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 639._


    Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
    Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 677._


               In naked beauty more adorn'd,
    More lovely than Pandora.[234-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 713._


                       Eas'd the putting off
    These troublesome disguises which we wear.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 739._


    Hail wedded love, mysterious law, true source
    Of human offspring.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 750._


    Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 800._


    Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
    Touch'd lightly; for no falsehood can endure
    Touch of celestial temper.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 810._


    Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,
    The lowest of your throng.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 830._


                  Abash'd the devil stood,
    And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
    Virtue in her shape how lovely.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 846._


    All hell broke loose.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 918._


    Like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 987._


                      The starry cope
    Of heaven.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 992._


                                    Fled
    Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 1014._


    Now morn, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime
    Advancing, sow'd the earth with orient pearl,
    When Adam wak'd, so custom'd; for his sleep
    Was aery light, from pure digestion bred.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 1._


    Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld
    Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,
    Shot forth peculiar graces.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 13._


                              My latest found,
    Heaven's last, best gift, my ever new delight!

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 18._


                          Good, the more
    Communicated, more abundant grows.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 71._


    These are thy glorious works, Parent of good!

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 153._


    Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,
    If better thou belong not to the dawn.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 166._


    A wilderness of sweets.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 294._


                          Another morn
    Ris'n on mid-noon.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 310._


    So saying, with despatchful looks in haste
    She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 331._


                          Nor jealousy
    Was understood, the injur'd lover's hell.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 449._


    The bright consummate flower.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 481._


    Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 601._


    They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
    Quaff immortality and joy.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 637._


    Satan; so call him now, his former name
    Is heard no more in heaven.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 658._


          Midnight brought on the dusky hour
    Friendliest to sleep and silence.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 667._


    Innumerable as the stars of night,
    Or stars of morning, dewdrops which the sun
    Impearls on every leaf and every flower.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 745._


    So spake the seraph Abdiel, faithful found;
    Among the faithless, faithful only he.

_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 896._


                                 Morn,
    Wak'd by the circling hours, with rosy hand
    Unbarr'd the gates of light.

_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 2._


    Servant of God, well done; well hast thou fought
    The better fight.

_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 29._


          Arms on armour clashing bray'd
    Horrible discord, and the madding wheels
    Of brazen chariots rag'd: dire was the noise
    Of conflict.

_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 209._


                  Spirits that live throughout,
    Vital in every part, not as frail man,
    In entrails, heart or head, liver or reins,
    Cannot but by annihilating die.

_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 345._


    Far off his coming shone.

_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 768._


    More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchang'd
    To hoarse or mute, though fall'n on evil days,
    On evil days though fall'n, and evil tongues.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 24._


                      Still govern thou my song,
    Urania, and fit audience find, though few.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 30._


                     Heaven open'd wide
    Her ever during gates, harmonious sound,
    On golden hinges moving.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 205._


    Hither, as to their fountain, other stars
    Repairing, in their golden urns draw light.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 364._


                     Now half appear'd
    The tawny lion, pawing to get free
    His hinder parts.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 463._


                             Indu'd
    With sanctity of reason.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 507._


    A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,
    And pavement stars,--as stars to thee appear
    Seen in the galaxy, that milky way
    Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
    Powder'd with stars.

_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 577._


    The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear
    So charming left his voice, that he awhile
    Thought him still speaking, still stood fix'd to hear.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 1._


                      There swift return
    Diurnal, merely to officiate light
    Round this opacous earth, this punctual spot.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 21._


    And grace that won who saw to wish her stay.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 43._


    And touch'd by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 47._

    Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 83._


                    Her silent course advance
    With inoffensive pace, that spinning sleeps
    On her soft axle.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 163._


                           Be lowly wise:
    Think only what concerns thee and thy being.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 173._


                               To know
    That which before us lies in daily life
    Is the prime wisdom.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 192._


    Liquid lapse of murmuring streams.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 263._


    And feel that I am happier than I know.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 282._


    Among unequals what society
    Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 383._


    Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,
    In every gesture dignity and love.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 488._


    Her virtue and the conscience of her worth,
    That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 502._


                She what was honour knew,
    And with obsequious majesty approv'd
    My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower
    I led her blushing like the morn; all heaven
    And happy constellations on that hour
    Shed their selectest influence; the earth
    Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;
    Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs
    Whisper'd it to the woods, and from their wings
    Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 508._


    The sum of earthly bliss.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 522._


                           So well to know
    Her own, that what she wills to do or say
    Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 548._


    Accuse not Nature: she hath done her part;
    Do thou but thine.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 561._


               Oft times nothing profits more
    Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right
    Well manag'd.[238-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 571._


                            Those graceful acts,
    Those thousand decencies that daily flow
    From all her words and actions.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 600._


                          With a smile that glow'd
    Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue.

_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 618._


    My unpremeditated verse.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 24._


    Pleas'd me, long choosing and beginning late.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 26._


             Unless an age too late, or cold
    Climate, or years, damp my intended wing.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 44._


              Revenge, at first though sweet,
    Bitter ere long back on itself recoils.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 171._


               The work under our labour grows,
    Luxurious by restraint.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 208._


                 Smiles from reason flow,
    To brute deny'd, and are of love the food.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 239._


    For solitude sometimes is best society,
    And short retirement urges sweet return.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 249._


    At shut of evening flowers.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 278._


    As one who long in populous city pent,
    Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 445._


    So gloz'd the tempter.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 549._


                 Hope elevates, and joy
    Brightens his crest.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 633._


                      Left that command
    Sole daughter of his voice.[239-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 652._


    Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,
    Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
    That all was lost.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 782._


                       In her face excuse
    Came prologue, and apology too prompt.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 853._


                          A pillar'd shade
    High overarch'd, and echoing walks between.

_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 1106._


                        Yet I shall temper so
    Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most
    Them fully satisfy'd, and thee appease.

_Paradise Lost. Book x. Line 77._


    So scented the grim Feature, and upturn'd
    His nostril wide into the murky air,
    Sagacious of his quarry from so far.

_Paradise Lost. Book x. Line 279._


                 How gladly would I meet
    Mortality my sentence, and be earth
    Insensible! how glad would lay me down
    As in my mother's lap!

_Paradise Lost. Book x. Line 775._


    Must I thus leave thee, Paradise?--thus leave
    Thee, native soil, these happy walks and shades?

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 269._


          Then purg'd with euphrasy and rue
    The visual nerve, for he had much to see.

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 414._


                        Moping melancholy
    And moon-struck madness.

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 485._


    And over them triumphant Death his dart
    Shook, but delay'd to strike, though oft invok'd.

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 491._


    So may'st thou live, till like ripe fruit thou drop
    Into thy mother's lap.

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 535._


    Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou liv'st
    Live well: how long or short permit to heaven.[240-1]

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 553._


    A bevy of fair women.

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 582._


    The brazen throat of war.

_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 713._


    Some natural tears they dropp'd, but wip'd them soon;
    The world was all before them, where to choose
    Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.
    They hand in hand, with wand'ring steps and slow,
    Through Eden took their solitary way.

_Paradise Lost. Book xii. Line 645._


                        Beauty stands
    In the admiration only of weak minds
    Led captive.

_Paradise Regained. Book ii. Line 220._


    Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd.

_Paradise Regained. Book ii. Line 228._


    Of whom to be disprais'd were no small praise.

_Paradise Regained. Book iii. Line 56._


    Elephants endors'd with towers.

_Paradise Regained. Book iii. Line 329._


    Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,
    Meroe, Nilotic isle.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 70._


    Dusk faces with white silken turbans wreath'd.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 76._


            The childhood shows the man,
    As morning shows the day.[241-1]

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 220._


    Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts
    And eloquence.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 240._


                  The olive grove of Academe,
    Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird
    Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 244._


    Thence to the famous orators repair,
    Those ancient, whose resistless eloquence
    Wielded at will that fierce democratie,
    Shook the arsenal, and fulmin'd over Greece,
    To Macedon, and Artaxerxes' throne.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 267._


    Socrates . . .
    Whom well inspir'd the oracle pronounc'd
    Wisest of men.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 274._


    Deep vers'd in books, and shallow in himself.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 327._


    As children gath'ring pebbles on the shore.
    Or if I would delight my private hours
    With music or with poem, where so soon
    As in our native language can I find
    That solace?

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 330._


                     Till morning fair
    Came forth with pilgrim steps in amice gray.

_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 426._


    O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,
    Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse
    Without all hope of day!

_Samson Agonistes. Line 80._


    The sun to me is dark
    And silent as the moon,
    When she deserts the night
    Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 86._


    Ran on embattled armies clad in iron,
    And, weaponless himself,
    Made arms ridiculous.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 129._


    Just are the ways of God,
    And justifiable to men;
    Unless there be who think not God at all.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 293._


    What boots it at one gate to make defence,
    And at another to let in the foe?

_Samson Agonistes. Line 560._


    But who is this, what thing of sea or land,--
    Female of sex it seems,--
    That so bedeck'd, ornate, and gay,
    Comes this way sailing
    Like a stately ship
    Of Tarsus, bound for th' isles
    Of Javan or Gadire,
    With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,
    Sails fill'd, and streamers waving,
    Courted by all the winds that hold them play,
    An amber scent of odorous perfume
    Her harbinger?

_Samson Agonistes. Line 710._


    Yet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power,
    After offence returning, to regain
    Love once possess'd.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 1003._


    He 's gone, and who knows how he may report
    Thy words by adding fuel to the flame?

_Samson Agonistes. Line 1350._


    For evil news rides post, while good news baits.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 1538._


    And as an ev'ning dragon came,
    Assailant on the perched roosts
    And nests in order rang'd
    Of tame villatic fowl.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 1692._


    Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail
    Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,
    Dispraise, or blame,--nothing but well and fair,
    And what may quiet us in a death so noble.

_Samson Agonistes. Line 1721._


    Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot
    Which men call earth.

_Comus. Line 5._


                          That golden key
    That opes the palace of eternity.

_Comus. Line 13._


    The nodding horror of whose shady brows
    Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger.

_Comus. Line 38._


                        I will tell you now
    What never yet was heard in tale or song,
    From old or modern bard, in hall or bower.

_Comus. Line 43._


    Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape
    Crush'd the sweet poison of misused wine.

_Comus. Line 46._


    These my sky-robes spun out of Iris' woof.

_Comus. Line 83._


    The star that bids the shepherd fold.

_Comus. Line 93._


    Midnight shout and revelry,
    Tipsy dance and jollity.

_Comus. Line 103._


    Ere the blabbing eastern scout,
    The nice morn, on th' Indian steep
    From her cabin'd loop-hole peep.

_Comus. Line 138._


                    When the gray-hooded Even,
    Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,
    Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain.

_Comus. Line 188._


                 A thousand fantasies
    Begin to throng into my memory,
    Of calling shapes, and beck'ning shadows dire,
    And airy tongues that syllable men's names
    On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.

_Comus. Line 205._


    O welcome, pure-ey'd Faith, white-handed Hope,
    Thou hovering angel, girt with golden wings!

_Comus. Line 213._


    Was I deceiv'd, or did a sable cloud
    Turn forth her silver lining on the night?

_Comus. Line 221._


    Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould
    Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?

_Comus. Line 244._


    How sweetly did they float upon the wings
    Of silence through the empty-vaulted night,
    At every fall smoothing the raven down
    Of darkness till it smil'd!

_Comus. Line 249._


    Who, as they sung, would take the prison'd soul
    And lap it in Elysium.

_Comus. Line 256._


    Such sober certainty of waking bliss.

_Comus. Line 263._


    I took it for a faery vision
    Of some gay creatures of the element,
    That in the colours of the rainbow live,
    And play i' th' plighted clouds.

_Comus. Line 298._


    It were a journey like the path to heaven,
    To help you find them.

_Comus. Line 303._


    With thy long levell'd rule of streaming light.

_Comus. Line 340._


    Virtue could see to do what virtue would
    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon
    Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self
    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,
    Where with her best nurse Contemplation
    She plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings,
    That in the various bustle of resort
    Were all-to ruffled, and sometimes impair'd.
    He that has light within his own clear breast
    May sit i' th' centre and enjoy bright day;
    But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
    Benighted walks under the midday sun.

_Comus. Line 373._


                           The unsunn'd heaps
    Of miser's treasure.

_Comus. Line 398._


    'T is chastity, my brother, chastity:
    She that has that is clad in complete steel.

_Comus. Line 420._


    Some say no evil thing that walks by night,
    In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,
    Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost
    That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,
    No goblin, or swart fairy of the mine,
    Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity.

_Comus. Line 432._


    So dear to heav'n is saintly chastity,
    That when a soul is found sincerely so,
    A thousand liveried angels lackey her,
    Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,
    And in clear dream and solemn vision
    Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear,
    Till oft converse with heav'nly habitants
    Begin to cast a beam on th' outward shape.

_Comus. Line 453._


    How charming is divine philosophy!
    Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,
    But musical as is Apollo's lute,[245-1]
    And a perpetual feast of nectar'd sweets
    Where no crude surfeit reigns.

_Comus. Line 476._


    And sweeten'd every musk-rose of the dale.

_Comus. Line 496._


    Fill'd the air with barbarous dissonance.

_Comus. Line 550._


                          I was all ear,
    And took in strains that might create a soul
    Under the ribs of death.

_Comus. Line 560._


                           That power
    Which erring men call Chance.

_Comus. Line 587._


                               If this fail,
    The pillar'd firmament is rottenness,
    And earth's base built on stubble.

_Comus. Line 597._


    The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,
    But in another country, as he said,
    Bore a bright golden flow'r, but not in this soil;
    Unknown, and like esteem'd, and the dull swain
    Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon.

_Comus. Line 631._


    Enter'd the very lime-twigs of his spells,
    And yet came off.

_Comus. Line 646._


                     This cordial julep here,
    That flames and dances in his crystal bounds.

_Comus. Line 672._


    Budge doctors of the Stoic fur.

_Comus. Line 707._


    And live like Nature's bastards, not her sons.

_Comus. Line 727._


    It is for homely features to keep home,--
    They had their name thence; coarse complexions
    And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply
    The sampler and to tease the huswife's wool.
    What need a vermeil-tinctur'd lip for that,
    Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn?

_Comus. Line 748._


                            Swinish gluttony
    Ne'er looks to heav'n amidst his gorgeous feast,
    But with besotted base ingratitude
    Crams, and blasphemes his feeder.

_Comus. Line 776._


    Enjoy your dear wit and gay rhetoric,
    That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence.

_Comus. Line 790._


                           His rod revers'd,
    And backward mutters of dissevering power.

_Comus. Line 816._


    Sabrina fair,
      Listen where thou art sitting
    Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,
      In twisted braids of lilies knitting
    The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair.

_Comus. Line 859._


    But now my task is smoothly done,
    I can fly, or I can run.

_Comus. Line 1012._


    Or if Virtue feeble were,
    Heav'n itself would stoop to her.

_Comus. Line 1022._


    I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,
    And with forc'd fingers rude
    Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.

_Lycidas. Line 3._


                                He knew
    Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.

_Lycidas. Line 10._


    Without the meed of some melodious tear.

_Lycidas. Line 14._


    Under the opening eyelids of the morn.

_Lycidas. Line 26._


    But oh the heavy change, now thou art gone,
    Now thou art gone and never must return!

_Lycidas. Line 37._


    The gadding vine.

_Lycidas. Line 40._


    And strictly meditate the thankless Muse.

_Lycidas. Line 66._


    To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,
    Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair.

_Lycidas. Line 68._


    Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise[247-1]
    (That last infirmity of noble mind)
    To scorn delights, and live laborious days;
    But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,
    And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
    Comes the blind Fury with th' abhorred shears
    And slits the thin-spun life.

_Lycidas. Line 70._


    Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil.

_Lycidas. Line 78._


    It was that fatal and perfidious bark,
    Built in th' eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark.

_Lycidas. Line 100._


    The pilot of the Galilean lake;
    Two massy keys he bore, of metals twain
    (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).

_Lycidas. Line 109._


    But that two-handed engine at the door
    Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.

_Lycidas. Line 130._


    Throw hither all your quaint enamell'd eyes
    That on the green turf suck the honied showers,
    And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
    Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,
    The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,
    The white pink, and the pansy freakt with jet,
    The glowing violet,
    The musk-rose, and the well-attir'd woodbine,
    With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,
    And every flower that sad embroidery wears.

_Lycidas. Line 139._


    So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,
    And yet anon repairs his drooping head,
    And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore
    Flames in the forehead of the morning sky.

_Lycidas. Line 168._


    He touch'd the tender stops of various quills,
    With eager thought warbling his Doric lay.

_Lycidas. Line 188._


    To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.

_Lycidas. Line 193._


    Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
    Jest and youthful Jollity,
    Quips and Cranks and wanton Wiles,
    Nods and Becks and wreathed Smiles.

_L'Allegro. Line 25._


    Sport, that wrinkled Care derides,
    And Laughter holding both his sides.
    Come and trip it as ye go,
    On the light fantastic toe.

_L'Allegro. Line 31._


    The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty.

_L'Allegro. Line 36._


    And every shepherd tells his tale
    Under the hawthorn in the dale.

_L'Allegro. Line 67._


    Meadows trim with daisies pied,
    Shallow brooks and rivers wide;
    Towers and battlements it sees
    Bosom'd high in tufted trees,
    Where perhaps some beauty lies,
    The cynosure of neighboring eyes.

_L'Allegro. Line 75._


    Herbs, and other country messes,
    Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses.

_L'Allegro. Line 85._


    To many a youth and many a maid
    Dancing in the chequer'd shade.

_L'Allegro. Line 95._


    Then to the spicy nut-brown ale.

_L'Allegro. Line 100._


    Tower'd cities please us then,
    And the busy hum of men.

_L'Allegro. Line 117._


               Ladies, whose bright eyes
    Rain influence, and judge the prize.

_L'Allegro. Line 121._


    Such sights as youthful poets dream
    On summer eyes by haunted stream.
    Then to the well-trod stage anon,
    If Jonson's learned sock be on,
    Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,
    Warble his native wood-notes wild.

_L'Allegro. Line 129._


    And ever against eating cares
    Lap me in soft Lydian airs,
    Married to immortal verse,[249-1]
    Such as the meeting soul may pierce,
    In notes with many a winding bout
    Of linked sweetness long drawn out.

    Untwisting all the chains that tie
    The hidden soul of harmony.

    That in trim gardens takes his pleasure.

_Il Penseroso. Line 49._


    Sweet bird, that shun'st the noise of folly,
    Most musical, most melancholy!

_Il Penseroso. Line 61._


                  I walk unseen
    On the dry smooth-shaven green,
    To behold the wandering moon
    Riding near her highest noon,
    Like one that had been led astray
    Through the heav'n's wide pathless way;
    And oft, as if her head she bow'd,
    Stooping through a fleecy cloud.

_Il Penseroso. Line 65._


    Where glowing embers through the room
    Teach light to counterfeit a gloom.

_Il Penseroso. Line 79._

    When the gust hath blown his fill,
    Ending on the rustling leaves
    With minute drops from off the eaves.

_Il Penseroso. Line 128._


    Hide me from day's garish eye.

          No voice or hideous hum
    Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
          Apollo from his shrine
          Can no more divine,
    With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
    No nightly trance or breathed spell
    Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.

_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 173._


    From haunted spring and dale
    Edg'd with poplar pale

    And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.

_Sonnet xxi. To Cyriac Skinner._


                       Yet I argue not

_Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce._


     A poet soaring in the high reason of his fancies, with his
     garland and singing robes about him.

_The Reason of Church Government. Introduction, Book ii._


     By labour and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this
     life), joined with the strong propensity of nature, I might
     perhaps leave something so written to after times as they should
     not willingly let it die.

_The Reason of Church Government. Introduction, Book ii._


     Beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still
     air of delightful studies.

     at command.

_Apology for Smectymnuus._


     Litigious terms, fat contentions, and flowing fees.

_Tractate of Education._


     I shall detain you no longer in the demonstration of what we
     should not do, but straight conduct ye to a hillside, where I
     will point ye out the right path of a virtuous and noble
     education; laborious indeed at the first ascent, but else so
     smooth, so green, so full of goodly prospect and melodious sounds
     on every side that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming.

_Tractate of Education._


     Enflamed with the study of learning and the admiration of virtue;
     stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave men and worthy
     patriots, dear to God, and famous to all ages.

_Tractate of Education._


     Ornate rhetorick taught out of the rule of Plato. . . . To which
     poetry would be made subsequent, or indeed rather precedent, as
     being less suttle and fine, but more simple, sensuous, and
     passionate.

_Tractate of Education._


     In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and
     pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature not to
     go out and see her riches, and partake in her rejoicing with
     heaven and earth.

_Tractate of Education._


     Attic tragedies of stateliest and most regal argument.

_Tractate of Education._


     As good almost kill a man as kill a good book: who kills a man
     kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a
     good book kills reason itself.

_Areopagitica._


     A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit,
     embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.

_Areopagitica._


     Seasoned life of man preserved and stored up in books.

_Areopagitica._


     I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and
     unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but
     slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run
     for, not without dust and heat.

_Areopagitica._


     Who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper
     softness in chambers?

_Areopagitica._


     Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing
     herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible
     locks; methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth,
     and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam.

_Areopagitica._


     Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the
     earth, so Truth be in the field, we do ingloriously, by licensing
     and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood
     grapple: who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open
     encounter?[255-1]

_Areopagitica._


     Men of most renowned virtue have sometimes by transgressing most
     truly kept the law.

_Tetrachordon._


     By this time, like one who had set out on his way by night, and
     travelled through a region of smooth or idle dreams, our history
     now arrives on the confines, where daylight and truth meet us
     with a clear dawn, representing to our view, though at a far
     distance, true colours and shapes.

_The History of England. Book i._


     Such bickerings to recount, met often in these our writers, what
     more worth is it than to chronicle the wars of kites or crows
     flocking and fighting in the air?

    Her feet beneath her petticoat

    But oh, she dances such a way!
    No sun upon an Easter-day

_Ballad upon a Wedding._


    Her lips were red, and one was thin;
    Compared with that was next her chin,--
    Some bee had stung it newly.

_Ballad upon a Wedding._


    Why so pale and wan, fond lover?
        Prithee, why so pale?
    Will, when looking well can't move her,

        Prithee, why so pale?

    We spent them not in toys, in lusts, or wine,

    The thirsty earth soaks up the rain,
    And drinks, and gapes for drink again;
    The plants suck in the earth, and are

_From Anacreon, ii. Drinking._


    Fill all the glasses there, for why
    Should every creature drink but I?
    Why, man of morals, tell me why?

_From Anacreon, ii. Drinking._


    A mighty pain to love it is,
    And 't is a pain that pain to miss;

    It is to love, but love in vain.

_From Anacreon, vii. Gold._

    My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,
      Mere glimmering and decays.

_They are all gone._


    Dear, beauteous death, the jewel of the just!
      Shining nowhere but in the dark;
    What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust,

_They are all gone._


    And yet, as angels in some brighter dreams
    Call to the soul when man doth sleep,
    So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,
    And into glory peep.

_They are all gone._


    Then bless thy secret growth, nor catch
    At noise, but thrive unseen and dumb;
    Keep clean, be as fruit, earn life, and watch
    Till the white-wing'd reapers come!

    Yet fool'd with hope, men favour the deceit;
    Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay.
    To-morrow 's falser than the former day;

FOOTNOTES:

[282-1] Our author, for the advantage of this play ("Appius and
    Virginia"), had invented a new species of thunder, which was
    approved of by the actors, and is the very sort that at present is
    used in the theatre. The tragedy however was coldly received,
    notwithstanding such assistance, and was acted but a short time.
    Some nights after, Mr. Dennis, being in the pit at the
    representation of "Macbeth," heard his own thunder made use of;
    upon which he rose in a violent passion, and exclaimed, with an
    oath, that it was his thunder. "See," said he, "how the rascals
    use me! They will not let my play run, and yet they steal my
    thunder!"--_Biographia Britannica, vol. v. p. 103._

    The dawn is overcast, the morning lowers,
    And heavily in clouds brings on the day,
    The great, the important day, big with the fate
    Of Cato and of Rome.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 1._


                  Thy steady temper, Portius,
    Can look on guilt, rebellion, fraud, and Cæsar,
    In the calm lights of mild philosophy.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 1._


    'T is not in mortals to command success,
    But we 'll do more, Sempronius,--we 'll deserve it.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 2._


    Blesses his stars and thinks it luxury.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 4._


    'T 's pride, rank pride, and haughtiness of soul;
    I think the Romans call it stoicism.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Were you with these, my prince, you 'd soon forget
    The pale, unripened beauties of the north.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 4._


    Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover,
    Fades in his eye, and palls upon the sense.
    The virtuous Marcia towers above her sex.

_Cato. Act i. Sc. 4._


                My voice is still for war.
    Gods! can a Roman senate long debate
    Which of the two to choose, slavery or death?

_Cato. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    Great Pompey's shade complains that we are slow,
    And Scipio's ghost walks unaveng'd amongst us!

_Cato. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    A day, an hour, of virtuous liberty
    Is worth a whole eternity in bondage.

_Cato. Act ii. Sc. 1._


    The woman that deliberates is lost.

_Cato. Act iv. Sc. 1._


    Curse all his virtues! they 've undone his country.

_Cato. Act iv. Sc. 4._


                          What a pity is it
    That we can die but once to save our country!

_Cato. Act iv. Sc. 4._

    When vice prevails, and impious men bear sway,
    The post of honour is a private station.[298-1]

_Cato. Act iv. Sc. 4._


    It must be so,--Plato, thou reasonest well!
    Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
    This longing after immortality?
    Or whence this secret dread and inward horror
    Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul
    Back on herself, and startles at destruction?
    'T is the divinity that stirs within us;
    'T is Heaven itself that points out an hereafter,
    And intimates eternity to man.
    Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!

_Cato. Act v. Sc. 1._


    I 'm weary of conjectures,--this must end 'em.
    Thus am I doubly armed: my death and life,
    My bane and antidote, are both before me:
    This in a moment brings me to an end;
    But this informs me I shall never die.
    The soul, secured in her existence, smiles
    At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.
    The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
    Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;
    But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,[299-1]
    Unhurt amidst the war of elements,
    The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds.

_Ode._


    Soon as the evening shades prevail,
    The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
    And nightly to the listening earth
    Repeats the story of her birth;
    While all the stars that round her burn,
    And all the planets in their turn,
    Confirm the tidings as they roll,
    And spread the truth from pole to pole.

    For ever singing as they shine,
    The hand that made us is divine.

_Speech, 1741._

     patriots, of whom he said, "All those men have their
     price."[304-1]

_On the Study and Use of History. Letter v._


     It is the modest, not the presumptuous, inquirer who makes a real

     in his word.[304-5]

    Think naught a trifle, though it small appear;

    And trifles life.

_Love of Fame. Satire vi. Line 208._

    When Harel wished to put a joke or witticism into circulation, he
    was in the habit of connecting it with some celebrated name, on

    But be rough as nutmeg-graters,
      And the rogues obey you well.

    Come then, expressive silence, muse His praise.

_Hymn. Line 118._


    A pleasing land of drowsyhed it was,
    Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;
    And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,
    Forever flushing round a summer sky:
    There eke the soft delights that witchingly
    Instil a wanton sweetness through the breast,
    And the calm pleasures always hover'd nigh;
    But whate'er smack'd of noyance or unrest
    Was far, far off expell'd from this delicious nest.

_The Castle of Indolence. Canto i. Stanza 6._


    O fair undress, best dress! it checks no vein,
    But every flowing limb in pleasure drowns,
    And heightens ease with grace.

_The Castle of Indolence. Canto i. Stanza 68._


    A little round, fat, oily man of God.

_The Castle of Indolence. Canto i. Stanza 69._


    I care not, Fortune, what you me deny:
    You cannot rob me of free Nature's grace,
    You cannot shut the windows of the sky
    Through which Aurora shows her brightening face;
    You cannot bar my constant feet to trace
    The woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve:
    Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace,
    And I their toys to the great children leave:
    Of fancy, reason, virtue, naught can me bereave.



_The Castle of Indolence. Canto ii. Stanza 3._


    Health is the vital principle of bliss,
    And exercise, of health.

_The Castle of Indolence. Canto ii. Stanza 55._


    Forever, Fortune, wilt thou prove
    An unrelenting foe to love;
    And when we meet a mutual heart,
    Come in between and bid us part?

_Song._


                    Whoe'er amidst the sons
    Of reason, valour, liberty, and virtue
    Displays distinguish'd merit, is a noble
    Of Nature's own creating.

    O Sophonisba! Sophonisba, O![358-1]

_Sophonisba. Act iii. Sc. 2._


    When Britain first, at Heaven's command,
      Arose from out the azure main,
    This was the charter of her land,
      And guardian angels sung the strain:
    Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!
    Britons never shall be slaves.

_Life of Addison._


     To be of no church is dangerous. Religion, of which the rewards
     are distant, and which is animated only by faith and hope, will

THOMAS GRAY. 1716-1771.

    What female heart can gold despise?
      What cat 's averse to fish?

_On the death of a Favourite Cat._


    A fav'rite has no friend!

_On the death of a Favourite Cat._


    Ye distant spires, ye antique towers.

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 1._


    Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!
      Ah, fields beloved in vain!
    Where once my careless childhood stray'd,
      A stranger yet to pain!
    I feel the gales that from ye blow
      A momentary bliss bestow.

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 2._


    They hear a voice in every wind,
      And snatch a fearful joy.

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 4._


    Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed,
      Less pleasing when possest;
    The tear forgot as soon as shed,
      The sunshine of the breast.

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 5._


    Alas! regardless of their doom,
      The little victims play;
    No sense have they of ills to come,
      Nor care beyond to-day.

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 6._


    Ah, tell them they are men!

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 6._


    And moody madness laughing wild
    Amid severest woe.

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 8._


    To each his suff'rings; all are men,
      Condemn'd alike to groan,--
    The tender for another's pain,
      Th' unfeeling for his own.
    Yet ah! why should they know their fate,
    Since sorrow never comes too late,
      And happiness too swiftly flies?
      Thought would destroy their paradise.
    No more; where ignorance is bliss,
      'T is folly to be wise.[382-1]

_On a Distant Prospect of Eton College. Stanza 10._


    Daughter of Jove, relentless power,
      Thou tamer of the human breast,
    Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour
      The bad affright, afflict the best!

    He pass'd the flaming bounds of place and time:
    The living throne, the sapphire blaze,
    Where angels tremble while they gaze,
    He saw; but blasted with excess of light,
    Closed his eyes in endless night.

_The Progress of Poesy. III. 2, Line 4._


    Bright-eyed Fancy, hov'ring o'er,
    Scatters from her pictured urn
    Thoughts that breathe and words that burn.[382-4]

_The Progress of Poesy. III. 3, Line 2._


    Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate,
    Beneath the good how far,--but far above the great.

_The Progress of Poesy. III. 3, Line 16._


    Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!
      Confusion on thy banners wait!
    Though fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing,

_The Bard. I. 1, Line 1._


    Loose his beard, and hoary hair
    Stream'd like a meteor to the troubled air.[383-1]

    Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes;
    Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart.[383-2]

_The Bard. I. 3, Line 12._


    Weave the warp, and weave the woof,
      The winding-sheet of Edward's race.
    Give ample room and verge enough[383-3]
      The characters of hell to trace.

_The Bard. II. 1, Line 1._


    Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows;
      While proudly riding o'er the azure realm
    In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes,
      Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;
    Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway,
    That hush'd in grim repose expects his evening prey.

_The Bard. II. 2, Line 9._


    Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,
    With many a foul and midnight murder fed.

    Iron sleet of arrowy shower
    Hurtles in the darken'd air.

_The Fatal Sisters. Line 3._


    The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
      The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,[384-1]
    The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
      And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

    Await alike the inevitable hour.
      The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 9._


    Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,
      The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 10._


    Can storied urn, or animated bust,

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 11._


    Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
      Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 12._


    But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
      Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;[384-2]
    Chill penury repress'd their noble rage,
      And froze the genial current of the soul.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 13._


    Full many a gem of purest ray serene
      The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;
    Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
      And waste its sweetness on the desert air.[385-1]

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 14._


    Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast
      The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
    Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
      Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 15._


    The applause of list'ning senates to command,
      The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
    To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
      And read their history in a nation's eyes.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 16._


    Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
      And shut the gates of mercy on mankind.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 17._


    Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
      Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
    Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
      They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.[385-2]

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 19._


    Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

      E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.[385-3]

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 23._


    Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,
      To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 25._


    One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
      Along the heath, and near his fav'rite tree:
    Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
      Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he.

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 28._


    Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,
      A youth to fortune and to fame unknown:
    Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
      And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.[386-1]

_The Epitaph._


    Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
      Heaven did a recompense as largely send:
    He gave to mis'ry (all he had) a tear,
      He gained from Heav'n ('t was all he wish'd) a friend.

_The Epitaph._


    No further seek his merits to disclose,
      Or draw his frailties from their dread abode
    (There they alike in trembling hope repose),
      The bosom of his Father and his God.

_The Epitaph._


    And weep the more, because I weep in vain.

_Sonnet. On the Death of Mr. West._

    The meanest floweret of the vale,
    The simplest note that swells the gale,
    The common sun, the air, the skies,
    To him are opening paradise.

_Ode on the Pleasure arising from Vicissitude. Line 53._


    And hie him home, at evening's close,
    To sweet repast and calm repose.

_Ode on the Pleasure arising from Vicissitude. Line 87._


    From toil he wins his spirits light,
    From busy day the peaceful night;
    Rich, from the very want of wealth,
    In heaven's best treasures, peace and health.

_Ode on the Pleasure arising from Vicissitude. Line 93._


    The social smile, the sympathetic tear.

_Education and Government._


    When love could teach a monarch to be wise,
    And gospel-light first dawn'd from Bullen's eyes.[387-1]

    Too poor for a bribe, and too proud to importune;
    He had not the method of making a fortune.

_On his own Character._


     Now as the Paradisiacal pleasures of the Mahometans consist in
     playing upon the flute and lying with Houris, be mine to read
     eternal new romances of Marivaux and Crebillon.

    Such is the patriot's boast, where'er we roam,--
    His first, best country ever is at home.

    Where wealth and freedom reign contentment fails,
    And honour sinks where commerce long prevails.

_The Traveller. Line 91._


    Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.

_The Traveller. Line 126._


    The canvas glow'd beyond ev'n Nature warm,
    The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form.[394-2]

_The Traveller. Line 137._


    By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd;
    The sports of children satisfy the child.

_The Traveller. Line 153._


    But winter lingering chills the lap of May.

_The Traveller. Line 172._


    Cheerful at morn, he wakes from short repose,
    Breasts the keen air, and carols as he goes.

_The Traveller. Line 185._


    So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar
    But bind him to his native mountains more.

_The Traveller. Line 217._


    Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days
    Have led their children through the mirthful maze,
    And the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,
    Has frisk'd beneath the burden of threescore.

_The Traveller. Line 251._


    They please, are pleas'd; they give to get esteem,
    Till seeming blest, they grow to what they seem.[395-1]

_The Traveller. Line 266._


    Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies.
    Methinks her patient sons before me stand,
    Where the broad ocean leans against the land.

_The Traveller. Line 282._


    Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,
    I see the lords of humankind pass by.[395-2]

_The Traveller. Line 327._


    The land of scholars and the nurse of arms.

_The Traveller. Line 356._


    For just experience tells, in every soil,
    That those that think must govern those that toil.

_The Traveller. Line 372._


    Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law.

_The Traveller. Line 386._


    Forc'd from their homes, a melancholy train,
    To traverse climes beyond the western main;
    Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around,
    And Niagara stuns with thundering sound.

_The Traveller. Line 409._


    Vain, very vain, my weary search to find
    That bliss which only centres in the mind.

_The Traveller. Line 423._


    Luke's iron crown, and Damien's bed of steel.[395-3]

_The Traveller. Line 436._


    Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain.

_The Deserted Village. Line 1._


    The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,
    For talking age and whispering lovers made.

_The Deserted Village. Line 13._


    The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love.

_The Deserted Village. Line 29._


    Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
    Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.
    Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,--
    A breath can make them, as a breath has made;[396-1]
    But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
    When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.

_The Deserted Village. Line 51._


    His best companions, innocence and health;
    And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.

_The Deserted Village. Line 61._


    How blest is he who crowns in shades like these
    A youth of labour with an age of ease!

_The Deserted Village. Line 99._


    While Resignation gently slopes away,
    And all his prospects brightening to the last,
    His heaven commences ere the world be past.

_The Deserted Village. Line 110._


    The watch-dog's voice that bay'd the whispering wind,
    And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind.

_The Deserted Village. Line 121._


    A man he was to all the country dear,
    And passing rich with forty pounds a year.

_The Deserted Village. Line 141._


    Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
    Shoulder'd his crutch, and shew'd how fields were won.

_The Deserted Village. Line 157._


    Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
    His pity gave ere charity began.
    Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
    And even his failings lean'd to Virtue's side.

_The Deserted Village. Line 161._


    And as a bird each fond endearment tries
    To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies,
    He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,
    Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.

_The Deserted Village. Line 167._


    Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,
    And fools who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.[397-1]

_The Deserted Village. Line 179._


    Even children follow'd with endearing wile,
    And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.

_The Deserted Village. Line 183._


    As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,
    Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,--
    Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
    Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

_The Deserted Village. Line 189._


    Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace
    The day's disasters in his morning face;
    Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee
    At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;
    Full well the busy whisper circling round
    Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd.
    Yet was he kind, or if severe in aught,
    The love he bore to learning was in fault;
    The village all declar'd how much he knew,
    'T was certain he could write and cipher too.

_The Deserted Village. Line 199._


    In arguing too, the parson own'd his skill,
    For e'en though vanquish'd he could argue still;
    While words of learned length and thundering sound
    Amaz'd the gazing rustics rang'd around;
    And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew
    That one small head could carry all he knew.

_The Deserted Village. Line 209._


    Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,
    And news much older than their ale went round.

_The Deserted Village. Line 223._


    The whitewash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,
    The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;
    The chest, contriv'd a double debt to pay,--
    A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day.[397-2]

_The Deserted Village. Line 227._


    The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose.[398-1]

_The Deserted Village. Line 232._


    To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
    One native charm, than all the gloss of art.

_The Deserted Village. Line 253._


    And e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,
    The heart distrusting asks if this be joy.

_The Deserted Village. Line 263._


    Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,
    Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn.

_The Deserted Village. Line 329._


    Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,
    Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.

_The Deserted Village. Line 344._


    In all the silent manliness of grief.

_The Deserted Village. Line 384._


    O Luxury! thou curst by Heaven's decree!

_The Deserted Village. Line 385._


    Thou source of all my bliss and all my woe,
    That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so.

_The Deserted Village. Line 413._


    Such dainties to them, their health it might hurt;
    It 's like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt.[398-2]

_The Haunch of Venison._


    As aromatic plants bestow
    No spicy fragrance while they grow;
    But crush'd or trodden to the ground,
    Diffuse their balmy sweets around.[398-3]

_The Captivity. Act i._


    To the last moment of his breath,
      On hope the wretch relies;
    And even the pang preceding death
      Bids expectation rise.[398-4]

_The Captivity. Act ii._


    Hope, like the gleaming taper's light,
      Adorns and cheers our way;[399-1]
    And still, as darker grows the night,
      Emits a brighter ray.

_The Captivity. Act ii._


    Our Garrick 's a salad; for in him we see
    Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree!

_Retaliation. Line 11._


    Who mix'd reason with pleasure, and wisdom with mirth:
    If he had any faults, he has left us in doubt.

_Retaliation. Line 24._


    Who, born for the universe, narrow'd his mind,
    And to party gave up what was meant for mankind;
    Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat
    To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote.
    Who too deep for his hearers still went on refining,
    And thought of convincing while they thought of dining:
    Though equal to all things, for all things unfit;
    Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit.

_Retaliation. Line 31._


    His conduct still right, with his argument wrong.

_Retaliation. Line 46._


    A flattering painter, who made it his care
    To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are.

_Retaliation. Line 63._


    Here lies David Garrick, describe me who can,
    An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man.

_Retaliation. Line 93._


    As a wit, if not first, in the very first line.

_Retaliation. Line 96._


    On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;
    'T was only that when he was off he was acting.

_Retaliation. Line 101._


    He cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,
    For he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back.

_Retaliation. Line 107._


    Who pepper'd the highest was surest to please.

_Retaliation. Line 112._


    When they talk'd of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff,
    He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.

_Retaliation. Line 145._


    The best-humour'd man, with the worst-humour'd Muse.[400-1]

_Postscript._


    Good people all, with one accord,
      Lament for Madam Blaize,
    Who never wanted a good word
      From those who spoke her praise.

_Elegy on Mrs. Mary Blaize._[400-2]


    The king himself has followed her
      When she has walk'd before.

_Elegy on Mrs. Mary Blaize._


    A kind and gentle heart he had,
      To comfort friends and foes;
    The naked every day he clad
      When he put on his clothes.

_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._


    And in that town a dog was found,
      As many dogs there be,
    Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
      And curs of low degree.

_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._


    The dog, to gain his private ends,
      Went mad, and bit the man.

_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._


    The man recovered of the bite,
      The dog it was that died.[400-3]

_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._


    A night-cap deck'd his brows instead of bay,--
    A cap by night, a stocking all the day.[401-1]

_Description of an Author's Bed-chamber._


     This same philosophy is a good horse in the stable, but an arrant
     jade on a journey.[401-2]

     All his faults are such that one loves him still the better for
     them.

_The Good-Natured Man. Act i._


     Silence gives consent.[401-3]

_The Good-Natured Man. Act ii._


     Measures, not men, have always been my mark.[401-4]

_The Good-Natured Man. Act ii._


     I love everything that 's old: old friends, old times, old
     manners, old books, old wine.[401-5]

_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._


     The very pink of perfection.

_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._


     The genteel thing is the genteel thing any time, if as be that a
     gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly.

_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._


     I 'll be with you in the squeezing of a lemon.

_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._


     Ask me no questions, and I 'll tell you no fibs.

_She Stoops to Conquer. Act iii._


     We sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to
     enhance the value of its favours.

_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. i._


     Handsome is that handsome does.[401-6]

_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. i._


     The premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe that the
     concatenation of self-existence, proceeding in a reciprocal
     duplicate ratio, naturally produces a problematical dialogism,
     which in some measure proves that the essence of spirituality may
     be referred to the second predicable.

_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. vii._


     I find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellect
     too.

_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. vii._


    Turn, gentle Hermit of the Dale,
      And guide my lonely way
    To where yon taper cheers the vale

    Taught by that Power that pities me,
      I learn to pity them.[402-1]

_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 6._


    Man wants but little here below,
      Nor wants that little long.[402-2]

_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 8._


    And what is friendship but a name,
      A charm that lulls to sleep,
    A shade that follows wealth or fame,
      And leaves the wretch to weep?

_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 19._


    The sigh that rends thy constant heart
      Shall break thy Edwin's too.

_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 33._


     By the living jingo, she was all of a muck of sweat.

_The Hermit. Chap. ix._


     They would talk of nothing but high life, and high-lived company,
     with other fashionable topics, such as pictures, taste,
     Shakespeare, and the musical glasses.

_The Hermit. Chap. ix._


     It has been a thousand times observed, and I must observe it once
     more, that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are
     more pleasing than those crowned with fruition.[402-3]

_The Hermit. Chap. x._


     To what happy accident[402-4] is it that we owe so unexpected a
     visit?

_The Hermit. Chap. xix._


    When lovely woman stoops to folly,
      And finds too late that men betray,
    What charm can soothe her melancholy?
      What art can wash her guilt away?

_The Hermit. On Woman. Chap. xxiv._


    The only art her guilt to cover,
      To hide her shame from every eye,
    To give repentance to her lover,
      And wring his bosom, is--to die.

_The Hermit. On Woman. Chap. xxiv._


     To what fortuitous occurrence do we not owe every pleasure and
     convenience of our lives.

_The Hermit. On Woman. Chap. xxi._


    For he who fights and runs away
    May live to fight another day;
    But he who is in battle slain
    Can never rise and fight again.[403-1]

_The Art of Poetry on a New Plan_ (1761). _Vol. ii. p. 147._


     One writer, for instance, excels at a plan or a title-page,
     another works away the body of the book, and a third is a dab at
     an index.[403-2]

_The Bee. No. 1, Oct. 6, 1759._


     The true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to
     conceal them.[403-3]

_The Bee. No. iii. Oct. 20, 1759._

    Then music with her silver sound.

    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!

    SHAKESPEARE: _Romeo and Juliet, act ii. sc. 1._

[405-2] Shakespeare, who alludes to this ballad in "Love's
    Labour's Lost," act iv. sc. 1, gives the beggar's name Zenelophon.

    Richard II.," act v. sc. 3.

EDMUND BURKE. 1729-1797.

     The writers against religion, whilst they oppose every system,
     are wisely careful never to set up any of their own.

_A Vindication of Natural Society._[407-1] _Preface, vol. i. p. 7._


     "War," says Machiavel, "ought to be the only study of a prince;"
     and by a prince he means every sort of state, however
     constituted. "He ought," says this great political doctor, "to
     consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure
     to contrive, and furnishes ability to execute military plans." A
     meditation on the conduct of political societies made old Hobbes
     imagine that war was the state of nature.

_A Vindication of Natural Society. Vol. i. p. 15._


     I am convinced that we have a degree of delight, and that no
     small one, in the real misfortunes and pains of others.[407-2]

_On the Sublime and Beautiful. Sect. xiv. vol. 1. p. 118._


     Custom reconciles us to everything.

_On the Sublime and Beautiful. Sect. xviii. vol. i. p. 231._


     There is, however, a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a
     virtue.

Vol. i. p. 273._


     The wisdom of our ancestors.[407-3]

_Observations on a Late Publication on the Present State of the Nation.
Vol. i. p. 516. Also in the Discussion on the Traitorous Correspondence
Bill, 1793._


     Illustrious predecessor.[408-1]

_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 456._


     In such a strait the wisest may well be perplexed and the boldest
     staggered.

_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 516._


     When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will
     fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible
     struggle.

_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 526._


     Of this stamp is the cant of, Not men, but measures.[408-2]

_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 531._


     The concessions of the weak are the concessions of fear.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 108._


     There is America, which at this day serves for little more than
     to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners, yet
     shall, before you taste of death, show itself equal to the whole
     of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 115._


     Fiction lags after truth, invention is unfruitful, and
     imagination cold and barren.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 116._


     A people who are still, as it were, but in the gristle, and not
     yet hardened into the bone of manhood.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 117._


     A wise and salutary neglect.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 117._


     My vigour relents,--I pardon something to the spirit of liberty.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 118._


     The religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a
     refinement on the principles of resistance: it is the dissidence
     of dissent, and the protestantism of the Protestant religion.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 123._


     I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against a
     whole people.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 136._


     The march of the human mind is slow.[408-3]

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 149._


     All government,--indeed, every human benefit and enjoyment, every
     virtue and every prudent act,--is founded on compromise and
     barter.

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 169._


     The worthy gentleman who has been snatched from us at the moment
     of the election, and in the middle of the contest, whilst his
     desires were as warm and his hopes as eager as ours, has
     feelingly told us what shadows we are, and what shadows we
     pursue.

_Speech at Bristol on Declining the Poll. Vol. ii. p. 420._


     They made and recorded a sort of institute and digest of anarchy,
     called the Rights of Man.

_On the Army Estimates. Vol iii. p. 221._


     People will not look forward to posterity who never look backward
     to their ancestors.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 274._


     You had that action and counteraction which, in the natural and
     in the political world, from the reciprocal struggle of
     discordant powers draws out the harmony of the universe.[409-1]

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 277._


     It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of
     France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never
     lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more
     delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating
     and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move
     in,--glittering like the morning star full of life and splendour
     and joy. . . . Little did I dream that I should have lived to see
     such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men,--in a
     nation of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand
     swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a
     look that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is
     gone; that of sophisters, economists, and calculators has
     succeeded.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 331._


     The unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of nations, the
     nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 332._


     Vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 332._


     Kings will be tyrants from policy, when subjects are rebels from
     principle.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 334._


     Learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down under the
     hoofs of a swinish multitude.[410-1]

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 335._


     Because half-a-dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field
     ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great
     cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak, chew the
     cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the
     noise are the only inhabitants of the field; that of course they
     are many in number; or that, after all, they are other than the
     little shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome
     insects of the hour.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 344._


     In their nomination to office they will not appoint to the
     exercise of authority as to a pitiful job, but as to a holy
     function.

     He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our
     skill. Our antagonist is our helper.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 453._


     To execute laws is a royal office; to execute orders is not to be
     a king. However, a political executive magistracy, though merely
     such, is a great trust.[411-1]

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 497._


     You can never plan the future by the past.[411-2]

_Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Vol. iv. p. 55._


     The cold neutrality of an impartial judge.

_Preface to Brissot's Address. Vol. v. p. 67._


     And having looked to Government for bread, on the very first
     scarcity they will turn and bite the hand that fed them.[411-3]

_Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. Vol. v. p. 156._


     All men that are ruined, are ruined on the side of their natural
     propensities.

_Letter i. On a Regicide Peace. Vol. v. p. 286._


     All those instances to be found in history, whether real or
     fabulous, of a doubtful public spirit, at which morality is
     perplexed, reason is staggered, and from which affrighted Nature
     recoils, are their chosen and almost sole examples for the
     instruction of their youth.

_Letter i. On a Regicide Peace. Vol. v. p. 311._


     Example is the school of mankind, and they will learn at no
     other.

_Letter i. On a Regicide Peace. Vol. v. p. 331._


     Early and provident fear is the mother of safety.

p. 54._


     The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.

_Speech at County Meeting of Bucks, 1784._


     I would rather sleep in the southern corner of a little country
     churchyard than in the tomb of the Capulets.[412-1]

_Letter to Matthew Smith._


     It has all the contortions of the sibyl without the
     inspiration.[412-2]

_Prior's Life of Burke._[412-3]


     He was not merely a chip of the old block, but the old block
     itself.[412-4]

    I burn to set the imprison'd wranglers free,

    There is in souls a sympathy with sounds;
    And as the mind is pitch'd the ear is pleased.
    With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;
    Some chord in unison with what we hear

    How soft the music of those village bells
    Falling at intervals upon the ear
    In cadence sweet!

_The Task. Book vi. Winter Walk at Noon. Line 1._

_Walking with God._


    And Satan trembles when he sees
    The weakest saint upon his knees.

_Exhortation to Prayer._


    God moves in a mysterious way
      His wonders to perform;

_On the Loss of the Royal George._


    There is a bird who by his coat,
    And by the hoarseness of his note,
      Might be supposed a crow.

_The Jackdaw._ (Translation from Vincent Bourne.)


    He sees that this great roundabout
    The world, with all its motley rout,
      Church, army, physic, law,
    Its customs and its businesses,
    Is no concern at all of his,
      And says--what says he?--Caw.

_The Jackdaw._ (Translation from Vincent Bourne.)


    For 't is a truth well known to most,
    That whatsoever thing is lost,
    We seek it, ere it come to light,
    In every cranny but the right.

    No radiant pearl which crested Fortune wears,
    No gem that twinkling hangs from Beauty's ears,

JOHN ADAMS. 1735-1826.

     Yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever was
     debated in America; and a greater perhaps never was, nor will be,
     decided among men. A resolution was passed without one dissenting
     colony, that those United Colonies are, and of right ought to be,
     free and independent States.

_Letter to Mrs. Adams, July 3, 1776._


     The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epocha
     in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be
     celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary
     festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance,
     by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be
     solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns,
     bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this
     continent to the other, from this time forward for evermore.

     lamp of experience. I know no way of judging of the future but by
     the past.[428-2]

_Speech in the Virginia Convention. March, 1775._


     Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price
     of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what
     course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give
     me death!

EDWARD GIBBON. 1737-1794.

     The reign of Antoninus is marked by the rare advantage of

     The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that
     it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the
     sublime makes the ridiculous, and one step above the ridiculous
     makes the sublime again.[431-2]

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 1743-1826.

     The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.

_Summary View of the Rights of British America._


     When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
     people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
     with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the
     separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of
     nature's God[434-2] entitle them, a decent respect to the
     opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
     which impel them to the separation.

_Declaration of Independence._


     We hold these truths to be self-evident,--that all men are
     created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
     certain unalienable rights;[434-3] that among these are life,
     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

_Declaration of Independence._


     We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our
     sacred honour.

_Declaration of Independence._


     Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to
     combat it.

_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1801._


     Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or
     persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce, and honest
     friendship with all nations,--entangling alliances with none; the
     support of the State governments in all their rights, as the most
     competent administrations for our domestic concerns, and the
     surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies; the
     preservation of the general government in its whole
     constitutional vigour, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home
     and safety abroad; . . . freedom of religion; freedom of the
     press; freedom of person under the protection of the habeas
     corpus; and trial by juries impartially selected,--these
     principles form the bright constellation which has gone before
     us, and guided our steps through an age of revolution and
     reformation.

_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1801._


     In the full tide of successful experiment.

_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1801._


     Of the various executive abilities, no one excited more anxious
     concern than that of placing the interests of our fellow-citizens
     in the hands of honest men, with understanding sufficient for
     their stations.[435-1] No duty is at the same time more difficult
     to fulfil. The knowledge of character possessed by a single
     individual is of necessity limited. To seek out the best through
     the whole Union, we must resort to the information which from the
     best of men, acting disinterestedly and with the purest motives,
     is sometimes incorrect.

_Letter to Elias Shipman and others of New Haven, July 12, 1801._


     If a due participation of office is a matter of right, how are
     vacancies to be obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation,
     none.[435-2]

    He was all for love, and a little for the bottle.

    Faithful below he did his duty,
      But now he 's gone aloft.

_Tom Bowling._


    For though his body 's under hatches,
      His soul has gone aloft.

_Tom Bowling._


    Spanking Jack was so comely, so pleasant, so jolly,
      Though winds blew great guns, still he 'd whistle and sing;
    Jack loved his friend, and was true to his Molly,
      And if honour gives greatness, was great as a king.

     To the memory of the Man, first in war, first in peace, and first
     in the hearts of his countrymen.

_Memoirs of Lee. Eulogy on Washington, Dec. 26, 1799._[445-3]


FOOTNOTES:

[445-3] To the memory of the Man, first in war, first in peace,
    and first in the hearts of his fellow-citizens.--_Resolutions
    presented to the United States' House of Representatives, on the
    Death of Washington, December, 1799._

    The eulogy was delivered a week later. Marshall, in his "Life of
    Washington," vol. v. p. 767, says in a note that these resolutions
    were prepared by Colonel Henry Lee, who was then not in his place
    to read them. General Robert E. Lee, in the Life of his father
    (1869), prefixed to the Report of his father's "Memoirs of the War
    of the Revolution," gives (p. 5) the expression "fellow-citizens;"
    but on p. 52 he says: "But there is a line, a single line, in the
    Works of Lee which would hand him over to immortality, though he
    had never written another: 'First in war, first in peace, and
    first in the hearts of his countrymen' will last while language
    lasts."




J. P. KEMBLE. 1757-1823.

    Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,
    But--why did you kick me down stairs?[445-4]

_The Panel. Act i. Sc. 1._


FOOTNOTES:

[445-4] Altered from Bickerstaff's "'T is Well 't is no Worse."
    The lines are also found in Debrett's "Asylum for Fugitive
    Pieces," vol. i. p. 15.




HORATIO NELSON. 1758-1805.

     In the battle off Cape St. Vincent, Nelson gave orders for
     boarding the "San Josef," exclaiming "Westminster Abbey, or
     victory!"

_Life of Nelson_ (Southey). _Vol. i. p. 93._


     England expects every man to do his duty.[446-1]

_Life of Nelson_ (Southey). _Vol. ii. p. 131._


FOOTNOTES:

[446-1] This famous sentence is thus first reported: "Say to the
    fleet, England confides that every man will do his duty." Captain
    Pasco, Nelson's flag-lieutenant, suggested to substitute "expects"
    for "confides," which was adopted. Captain Blackwood, who
    commanded the "Euryalis," says that the correction suggested was
    from "Nelson expects" to "England expects."




ROBERT BURNS. 1759-1796.

    Auld Nature swears the lovely dears
      Her noblest work she classes, O;
    Her 'prentice han' she tried on man,
      And then she made the lasses, O![446-2]

_Green grow the Rashes._


    Some books are lies frae end to end.

_Death and Dr. Hornbook._


    Some wee short hours ayont the twal.

_Death and Dr. Hornbook._


    The best laid schemes o' mice and men
             Gang aft a-gley;
    And leave us naught but grief and pain
             For promised joy.

_To a Mouse._


    When chill November's surly blast
      Made fields and forests bare.

_Man was made to Mourn._


    Man's inhumanity to man
    Makes countless thousands mourn.

_Man was made to Mourn._

    He wales a portion with judicious care;
    And "Let us worship God," he says with solemn air.

_The Cotter's Saturday Night._


    Perhaps Dundee's wild-warbling measures rise,
    Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name.

_The Cotter's Saturday Night._


    From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs,
      That makes her loved at home, revered abroad:
    Princes and lords are but the breath of kings,
      "An honest man 's the noblest work of God."[447-1]

_The Cotter's Saturday Night._


    For a' that, and a' that,
    And twice as muckle 's a' that.

_The Jolly Beggars._


    O Life! how pleasant is thy morning,
    Young Fancy's rays the hills adorning!
    Cold-pausing Caution's lesson scorning,
               We frisk away,
    Like schoolboys at th' expected warning,
               To joy and play.

_Epistle to James Smith._


    Misled by fancy's meteor ray,
               By passion driven;
    But yet the light that led astray
               Was light from heaven.

_The Vision._


    And like a passing thought, she fled
               In light away.

_The Vision._


    Affliction's sons are brothers in distress;
    A brother to relieve,--how exquisite the bliss!

_A Winter Night._


    His locked, lettered, braw brass collar
    Showed him the gentleman and scholar.

_The Twa Dogs._


    And there began a lang digression
    About the lords o' the creation.

_The Twa Dogs._


    Oh wad some power the giftie gie us
    To see oursel's as others see us!
    It wad frae monie a blunder free us,
               And foolish notion.

_To a Louse._


    Then gently scan your brother man,
      Still gentler sister woman;
    Though they may gang a kennin' wrang,
      To step aside is human.[448-1]

_Address to the Unco Guid._


    What 's done we partly may compute,
      But know not what 's resisted.

_Address to the Unco Guid._

    O life! thou art a galling load,
    Along a rough, a weary road,
      To wretches such as I!

_Despondency._


    Perhaps it may turn out a sang,
    Perhaps turn out a sermon.

_Epistle to a Young Friend._


    I waive the quantum o' the sin,
      The hazard of concealing;
    But, och! it hardens a' within,
      And petrifies the feeling!

_Epistle to a Young Friend._


    The fear o' hell 's a hangman's whip
      To haud the wretch in order;[448-3]
    But where ye feel your honour grip,
      Let that aye be your border.

_Epistle to a Young Friend._


    An atheist's laugh 's a poor exchange
      For Deity offended!

_Epistle to a Young Friend._


    And may you better reck the rede,[448-4]
      Than ever did the adviser!

_Epistle to a Young Friend._


    Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes;
    Flow gently, I 'll sing thee a song in thy praise.

_Flow gently, sweet Afton._


    Oh whistle, and I 'll come to ye, my lad.[449-1]

_Whistle, and I 'll come to ye._

    I 'll care for naebody.[449-2]

_I hae a Wife o' my Ain._


    Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
      And never brought to mind?
    Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
      And days o' lang syne?

_Auld Lang Syne._


    We twa hae run about the braes,
    And pu'd the gowans fine.

_Auld Lang Syne._


    Dweller in yon dungeon dark,
    Hangman of creation, mark!
    Who in widow weeds appears,
    Laden with unhonoured years,
    Noosing with care a bursting purse,
    Baited with many a deadly curse?

_Ode on Mrs. Oswald._


    To make a happy fireside clime
              To weans and wife,--
    That 's the true pathos and sublime
              Of human life.

_Epistle to Dr. Blacklock._


    If there 's a hole in a' your coats,
                I rede ye tent it;
    A chiel 's amang ye takin' notes,
                And, faith, he 'll prent it.

_On Captain Grose's Peregrinations through Scotland._


    John Anderson my jo, John,
      When we were first acquent,
    Your locks were like the raven,
      Your bonny brow was brent.

_John Anderson._


    My heart 's in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
    My heart 's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer.[450-1]

_My Heart 's in the Highlands._


    She is a winsome wee thing,
    She is a handsome wee thing,
    She is a bonny wee thing,
    This sweet wee wife o' mine.

_My Wife 's a Winsome Wee Thing._


    The golden hours on angel wings
      Flew o'er me and my dearie;
    For dear to me as light and life
      Was my sweet Highland Mary.

_Highland Mary._


    But, oh! fell death's untimely frost
      That nipt my flower sae early.

_Highland Mary._


    It 's guid to be merry and wise,[450-2]
    It 's guid to be honest and true,
    It 's guid to support Caledonia's cause,
    And bide by the buff and the blue.

_Here 's a Health to Them that 's Awa'._


    Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled,
    Scots, wham Bruce has aften led,

_Bannockburn._


    In durance vile[450-4] here must I wake and weep,
    And all my frowsy couch in sorrow steep.

_Epistle from Esopus to Maria._


    Oh, my luve 's like a red, red rose,
      That 's newly sprung in June;
    Oh, my luve 's like the melodie
      That 's sweetly played in tune.

_A Red, Red Rose._


    Contented wi' little, and cantie wi' mair.

_Contented wi' Little._


    Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,
    Gathering her brows like gathering storm,
    Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet
    To think how monie counsels sweet,
    How monie lengthened sage advices,
    The husband frae the wife despises.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony;
    Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither,--
    They had been fou for weeks thegither.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    The landlady and Tam grew gracious
    Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    The landlord's laugh was ready chorus.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,
    O'er a' the ills o' life victorious.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    But pleasures are like poppies spread,
    You seize the flower, its bloom is shed;
    Or, like the snow-fall in the river,
    A moment white, then melts forever.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    Nae man can tether time or tide.[451-1]

_Tam o' Shanter._


    That hour, o' night's black arch the keystane.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    Inspiring, bold John Barleycorn,
    What dangers thou canst make us scorn!

_Tam o' Shanter._


    As Tammie glow'red, amazed and curious,
    The mirth and fun grew fast and furious.

_Tam o' Shanter._


    But to see her was to love her,[452-1]
    Love but her, and love forever.

_Ae Fond Kiss._


    Had we never loved sae kindly,
    Had we never loved sae blindly,
    Never met or never parted,
    We had ne'er been broken-hearted!

_Ae Fond Kiss._


    To see her is to love her,
      And love but her forever;
    For Nature made her what she is,
      And never made anither!

_Bonny Lesley._


    Ye banks and braes o' bonny Doon,
      How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair?
    How can ye chant, ye little birds,
      And I sae weary fu' o' care?

_The Banks of Doon._


    Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure
    Thrill the deepest notes of woe.

_Sweet Sensibility._


    The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
      The man 's the gowd for a' that.[452-2]

_For a' that and a' that._


    A prince can make a belted knight,
      A marquis, duke, and a' that;
    But an honest man 's aboon his might,
      Guid faith, he maunna fa' that.[452-3]

_For a' that and a' that._


    'T is sweeter for thee despairing
    Than aught in the world beside,--Jessy!

_Jessy._


    Some hae meat and canna eat,
      And some would eat that want it;
    But we hae meat, and we can eat,
      Sae let the Lord be thankit.

_Grace before Meat._


    It was a' for our rightfu' King
      We left fair Scotland's strand.

_A' for our Rightfu' King._[452-4]


    Now a' is done that men can do,
      And a' is done in vain.

_A' for our Rightfu' King._


    He turn'd him right and round about
      Upon the Irish shore,
    And gae his bridle reins a shake,
      With, "Adieu for evermore, my dear,
      And adieu for evermore."[453-1]

_A' for our Rightfu' King._

    has made very free use of it, first in "Rokeby" (1813), and then
    in the "Monastery" (1816). In "Rokeby" he thus introduces the
    verse:--

    He turn'd his charger as he spake,
      Upon the river shore,
    He gave his bridle reins a shake,
      Said, "Adieu for evermore, my love,

     If you choose to represent the various parts in life by holes
     upon a table, of different shapes,--some circular, some
     triangular, some square, some oblong,--and the persons acting
     these parts by bits of wood of similar shapes, we shall generally
     find that the triangular person has got into the square hole, the
     oblong into the triangular, and a square person has squeezed
     himself into the round hole. The officer and the office, the doer
     and the thing done, seldom fit so exactly that we can say they
     were almost made for each other.[461-3]

     back upon his chintz bed which has paid twenty-two per cent, and
     expires in the arms of an apothecary who has paid a license of a
     hundred pounds for the privilege of putting him to death.

     In the midst of this sublime and terrible storm [at Sidmouth],
     Dame Partington, who lived upon the beach, was seen at the door
     of her house with mop and pattens, trundling her mop, squeezing
     out the sea-water, and vigorously pushing away the Atlantic
     Ocean. The Atlantic was roused; Mrs. Partington's spirit was up.
     But I need not tell you that the contest was unequal; the
     Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington.

DUKE OF WELLINGTON. 1769-1852.

     Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a
     battle won.

_Despatch, 1815._


     It is very true that I have said that I considered Napoleon's
     presence in the field equal to forty thousand men in the balance.
     This is a very loose way of talking; but the idea is a very
     different one from that of his presence at a battle being equal
     to a reinforcement of forty thousand men.

[463-1] STANHOPE: _Conversations with the Duke of Wellington, p.
    81._

[463-2] This phrase was first used by the Duke of Wellington in a
    letter, about 1839 or 1840.--SALA: _Echoes of the Week, in London
    Illustrated News, Aug. 23, 1884._ Greville, _Mem., ch. ii._
    (1823), gives an earlier instance.

[463-3] Sir William Fraser, in "Words on Wellington" (1889), p.
    12, says this phrase originated with the Duke. Captain Gronow, in
    his "Recollections," says it originated with the Duke of York,
    second son of George III., about 1817.

[463-4] This gave rise to the slang expression, "And no
    mistake."--_Words on Wellington, p. 122._

                    The sounding cataract

    An appetite,--a feeling and a love,
    That had no need of a remoter charm
    By thoughts supplied, nor any interest
    Unborrowed from the eye.

    This minstrel lead, his sins forgiven;
    The rueful conflict, the heart riven
      With vain endeavour,
    And memory of Earth's bitter leaven
      Effaced forever.

_Thoughts suggested on the Banks of the Nith._


    The best of what we do and are,
      Just God, forgive!

    And battles long ago.

    Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain
    That has been, and may be again.

    The music in my heart I bore
    Long after it was heard no more.

    Yon foaming flood seems motionless as ice;
    Its dizzy turbulence eludes the eye,
    Frozen by distance.

_Address to Kilchurn Castle._


    A famous man is Robin Hood,
    The English ballad-singer's joy.

_Rob Roy's Grave._


           Because the good old rule
    Sufficeth them,--the simple plan,
    That they should take who have the power,
           And they should keep who can.



_Rob Roy's Grave._


    The Eagle, he was lord above,
      And Rob was lord below.

_Sonnet, in the Pass of Killicranky._


    O Cuckoo! shall I call thee bird,
    Or but a wandering voice?

_To the Cuckoo._


    She was a phantom of delight
    When first she gleamed upon my sight,
    A lovely apparition, sent
    To be a moment's ornament;
    Her eyes as stars of twilight fair,
    Like twilights too her dusky hair,
    But all things else about her drawn
    From May-time and the cheerful dawn.

_She was a Phantom of Delight._


    A creature not too bright or good
    For human nature's daily food;
    For transient sorrows, simple wiles,
    Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.

_She was a Phantom of Delight._


    The reason firm, the temperate will,
    Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;
    A perfect woman, nobly planned,
    To warn, to comfort, and command.

_She was a Phantom of Delight._


                      That inward eye
    Which is the bliss of solitude.

    A Miser's pensioner,--behold our lot!

               A light to guide, a rod
    To check the erring, and reprove.

    Give unto me, made lowly wise,
    The spirit of self-sacrifice;
    The confidence of reason give,
    And in the light of truth thy bondman let me live!

    The light that never was, on sea or land;
    The consecration, and the Poet's dream.

    Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.

    Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
    Great issues, good or bad for humankind,
    Is happy as a lover.

_Character of the Happy Warrior._


    And through the heat of conflict keeps the law
    In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw.

_Character of the Happy Warrior._


    Whom neither shape of danger can dismay,
    Nor thought of tender happiness betray.

_Character of the Happy Warrior._


    Like,--but oh how different!

_Yes, it was the Mountain Echo._


    The world is too much with us; late and soon,
    Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
    Little we see in Nature that is ours.

_Miscellaneous Sonnets. Part i. xxxiii._


              Great God! I 'd rather be
    A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn,
    So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
    Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
    Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,
    Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.

_Personal Talk. Stanza 2._


    Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,
    Are a substantial world, both pure and good.

        But yet I know, where'er I go,
    That there hath passed away a glory from the earth.

_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 2._


    Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 5._


    Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
    The soul that rises with us, our life's star,
        Hath had elsewhere its setting,
          And cometh from afar.
        Not in entire forgetfulness,
        And not in utter nakedness,
    But trailing clouds of glory, do we come
        From God, who is our home:
    Heaven lies about us in our infancy.

_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 5._


    At length the man perceives it die away,

    Perpetual benediction.

_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._


              Those obstinate questionings
        Of sense and outward things,
        Fallings from us, vanishings,
        Blank misgivings of a creature
    Moving about in worlds not realized,
    High instincts before which our mortal nature
    Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised.

_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._


                Truths that wake,
    To perish never.

_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._


        Though inland far we be,
    Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
        Which brought us hither.

    To me the meanest flower that blows can give
    Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

    Two voices are there: one is of the sea,
    One of the mountains,--each a mighty voice.

_Song at the Feast of Broughton Castle._


    The silence that is in the starry sky.

_Song at the Feast of Broughton Castle._


    The monumental pomp of age
    Was with this goodly personage;
    A stature undepressed in size,
    Unbent, which rather seemed to rise
    In open victory o'er the weight
    Of seventy years, to loftier height.

_The White Doe of Rylstone. Canto iii._


    "What is good for a bootless bene?"
    With these dark words begins my tale;

    When prayer is of no avail?

_Force of Prayer._


    A few strong instincts, and a few plain rules.

_Alas! what boots the long laborious Quest?_


    Of blessed consolations in distress.

    The imperfect offices of prayer and praise.

                 That mighty orb of song,
    The divine Milton.

_The Excursion. Book i._

    And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust
    Burn to the socket.

_The Excursion. Book i._


    This dull product of a scoffer's pen.

_The Excursion. Book ii._


    With battlements that on their restless fronts
    Bore stars.

    Wisdom is ofttimes nearer when we stoop
    Than when we soar.

           Monastic brotherhood, upon rock
    Aerial.

    The intellectual power, through words and things,
    Went sounding on a dim and perilous way![480-1]

_The Excursion. Book iii._


    And the most difficult of tasks to keep
    Heights which the soul is competent to gain.

_The Excursion. Book iv._


    There is a luxury in self-dispraise;
    And inward self-disparagement affords
    To meditative spleen a grateful feast.

_The Excursion. Book iv._


        Recognizes ever and anon
    The breeze of Nature stirring in his soul.

_The Excursion. Book iv._


                       Pan himself,
    The simple shepherd's awe-inspiring god!

_The Excursion. Book iv._


                       I have seen
    A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
    Of inland ground, applying to his ear
    The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell,
    To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
    Listened intensely; and his countenance soon
    Brightened with joy, for from within were heard
    Murmurings, whereby the monitor expressed
    Mysterious union with his native sea.[480-2]

_The Excursion. Book iv._


    So build we up the being that we are.

_The Excursion. Book iv._


        One in whom persuasion and belief
    Had ripened into faith, and faith become
    A passionate intuition.

_The Excursion. Book iv._


    Spires whose "silent finger points to heaven."[481-1]

_The Excursion. Book vi._


    Ah, what a warning for a thoughtless man,
    Could field or grove, could any spot of earth,
    Show to his eye an image of the pangs
    Which it hath witnessed,--render back an echo
    Of the sad steps by which it hath been trod!

_The Excursion. Book vi._


                   And when the stream
    Which overflowed the soul was passed away,
    A consciousness remained that it had left
    Deposited upon the silent shore
    Of memory images and precious thoughts
    That shall not die, and cannot be destroyed.

_The Excursion. Book vii._


    Wisdom married to immortal verse.[481-2]

_The Excursion. Book vii._


    A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays
    And confident to-morrows.

_The Excursion. Book vii._


    The primal duties shine aloft, like stars;
    The charities that soothe and heal and bless
    Are scattered at the feet of man like flowers.

_The Excursion. Book ix._


                By happy chance we saw
    A twofold image: on a grassy bank
    A snow-white ram, and in the crystal flood
    Another and the same![481-3]

_The Excursion. Book ix._


                           The gods approve
    The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul.

_Laodamia._


                                    Mightier far
    Than strength of nerve or sinew, or the sway
    Of magic potent over sun and star,
    Is Love, though oft to agony distrest,
    And though his favorite seat be feeble woman's breast.

_Laodamia._


    Elysian beauty, melancholy grace,
    Brought from a pensive though a happy place.

_Laodamia._


    He spake of love, such love as spirits feel
    In worlds whose course is equable and pure;
    No fears to beat away, no strife to heal,--
    The past unsighed for, and the future sure.

_Laodamia._


    Of all that is most beauteous, imaged there
    In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,
    An ampler ether, a diviner air,
    And fields invested with purpureal gleams.

_Laodamia._


    Yet tears to human suffering are due;
    And mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown
    Are mourned by man, and not by man alone.

_Laodamia._


    But shapes that come not at an earthly call
    Will not depart when mortal voices bid.

_Dion._


    But thou that didst appear so fair
      To fond imagination,
    Dost rival in the light of day
      Her delicate creation.

_Yarrow Visited._


    'T is hers to pluck the amaranthine flower
    Of faith, and round the sufferer's temples bind
    Wreaths that endure affliction's heaviest shower,
    And do not shrink from sorrow's keenest wind.

_Weak is the Will of Man._


    We bow our heads before Thee, and we laud
    And magnify thy name Almighty God!
    But man is thy most awful instrument
    In working out a pure intent.



_Ode. Imagination before Content._


    Sad fancies do we then affect,
    In luxury of disrespect
    To our own prodigal excess
    Of too familiar happiness.

_Ode to Lycoris._


    That kill the bloom before its time,
    And blanch, without the owner's crime,
    The most resplendent hair.

_Lament of Mary Queen of Scots._


    The sightless Milton, with his hair
    Around his placid temples curled;
    And Shakespeare at his side,--a freight,
    If clay could think and mind were weight,
    For him who bore the world!

_The Italian Itinerant._


    Meek Nature's evening comment on the shows
    That for oblivion take their daily birth
    From all the fuming vanities of earth.

    Turning, for them who pass, the common dust
    Of servile opportunity to gold.

_Desultory Stanza._


                            Babylon,
    Learned and wise, hath perished utterly,
    Nor leaves her speech one word to aid the sigh
    That would lament her.

_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part i. xxv. Missions and Travels._


    As thou these ashes, little brook, wilt bear
    Into the Avon, Avon to the tide
    Of Severn, Severn to the narrow seas,
    Into main ocean they, this deed accursed
    An emblem yields to friends and enemies
    How the bold teacher's doctrine, sanctified
    By truth, shall spread, throughout the world dispersed.[483-1]

_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part ii. xvii. To Wickliffe._


                        The feather, whence the pen

Covenanters._


                       Where music dwells
    Lingering and wandering on as loth to die,
    Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
    That they were born for immortality.

    Soft is the music that would charm forever;
    The flower of sweetest smell is shy and lowly.

_Not Love, not War._


    True beauty dwells in deep retreats,
      Whose veil is unremoved
    Till heart with heart in concord beats,
      And the lover is beloved.

    Type of the wise who soar but never roam,
    True to the kindred points of heaven and home.

_To a Skylark._


    A Briton even in love should be
    A subject, not a slave!

_Ere with Cold Beads of Midnight Dew._


    Scorn not the sonnet. Critic, you have frowned,
    Mindless of its just honours; with this key
    Shakespeare unlocked his heart.[485-1]

_Scorn not the Sonnet._


                    And when a damp
    Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
    The thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
    Soul-animating strains,--alas! too few.

_Scorn not the Sonnet._


    But he is risen, a later star of dawn.

_The Trosachs._


    Myriads of daisies have shone forth in flower
    Near the lark's nest, and in their natural hour
    Have passed away; less happy than the one
    That by the unwilling ploughshare died to prove
    The tender charm of poetry and love.

_Poems composed during a Tour in the Summer of 1833. xxxvii._


    Small service is true service while it lasts.
    Of humblest friends, bright creature! scorn not one:
    The daisy, by the shadow that it casts,
    Protects the lingering dewdrop from the sun.

_To a Child. Written in her Album._


    Since every mortal power of Coleridge
    Was frozen at its marvellous source,
    The rapt one, of the godlike forehead,
    The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:
    And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,
    Has vanished from his lonely hearth.

_Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg._


    How fast has brother followed brother,

    Because the lovely little flower is free
    Down to its root, and in that freedom bold.

[483-1] In obedience to the order of the Council of Constance
    (1415), the remains of Wickliffe were exhumed and burned to ashes,
    and these cast into the Swift, a neighbouring brook running hard
    by; and "thus this brook hath conveyed his ashes into Avon, Avon
    into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, they into the main
    ocean. And thus the ashes of Wickliffe are the emblem of his
    doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world over."--FULLER:

    What Heraclitus would not laugh, or what Democritus would not

    and drowned his ashes, yet the word of God and truth of his

    "Some prophet of that day said,--

    "'The Avon to the Severn runs,
       The Severn to the sea;
     And Wickliffe's dust shall spread abroad
       Wide as the waters be.'"

SIR WALTER SCOTT. 1771-1832.

    Such is the custom of Branksome Hall.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto i. Stanza 7._


    If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright,
    Go visit it by the pale moonlight.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 1._


    O fading honours of the dead!
    O high ambition, lowly laid!

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 10._


    I was not always a man of woe.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 12._


    I cannot tell how the truth may be;
    I say the tale as 't was said to me.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 22._


    In peace, Love tunes the shepherd's reed;
    In war, he mounts the warrior's steed;
    In halls, in gay attire is seen;
    In hamlets, dances on the green.
    Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
    And men below and saints above;
    For love is heaven, and heaven is love.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iii. Stanza 1._


    Her blue eyes sought the west afar,
    For lovers love the western star.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iii. Stanza 24._


    Along thy wild and willow'd shore.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iv. Stanza 1._


                            Ne'er
    Was flattery lost on poet's ear;
    A simple race! they waste their toil
    For the vain tribute of a smile.



_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iv. Stanza 35._


    Call it not vain: they do not err
    Who say that when the poet dies
    Mute Nature mourns her worshipper,
    And celebrates his obsequies.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto v. Stanza 1._


    True love 's the gift which God has given
    To man alone beneath the heaven:
      It is not fantasy's hot fire,
        Whose wishes soon as granted fly;
      It liveth not in fierce desire,
        With dead desire it doth not die;
    It is the secret sympathy,
    The silver link, the silken tie,
    Which heart to heart and mind to mind
    In body and in soul can bind.

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto v. Stanza 13._


    Breathes there the man with soul so dead
    Who never to himself hath said,
      This is my own, my native land!
    Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd[488-1]
    As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
      From wandering on a foreign strand?
    If such there breathe, go, mark him well!
    For him no minstrel raptures swell;
    High though his titles, proud his name,
    Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,--
    Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
    The wretch, concentred all in self,
    Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
    And, doubly dying, shall go down
    To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
    Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung.[488-2]

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto vi. Stanza 1._


    O Caledonia! stern and wild,
    Meet nurse for a poetic child!
    Land of brown heath and shaggy wood;
    Land of the mountain and the flood!

_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto vi. Stanza 2._


    Profan'd the God-given strength, and marr'd the lofty line.

_Marmion. Introduction to Canto i._


    Just at the age 'twixt boy and youth,
    When thought is speech, and speech is truth.

_Marmion. Introduction to Canto ii._


    When, musing on companions gone,
    We doubly feel ourselves alone.

_Marmion. Introduction to Canto ii._


    'T is an old tale and often told;
      But did my fate and wish agree,
    Ne'er had been read, in story old,
    Of maiden true betray'd for gold,
      That loved, or was avenged, like me.

_Marmion. Canto ii. Stanza 27._


    When Prussia hurried to the field,
    And snatch'd the spear, but left the shield.[489-1]

_Marmion. Introduction to Canto iii._


    In the lost battle,
      Borne down by the flying,
    Where mingles war's rattle
      With groans of the dying.

_Marmion. Canto iii. Stanza 11._


    Where 's the coward that would not dare
      To fight for such a land?

_Marmion. Canto iv. Stanza 30._


    Lightly from fair to fair he flew,
    And loved to plead, lament, and sue;
    Suit lightly won, and short-lived pain,
    For monarchs seldom sigh in vain.

_Marmion. Canto v. Stanza 9._


    With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.[489-2]

_Marmion. Canto v. Stanza 12._


    But woe awaits a country when
    She sees the tears of bearded men.

_Marmion. Canto v. Stanza 16._


               And dar'st thou then
    To beard the lion in his den,
      The Douglas in his hall?

_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 14._


    Oh what a tangled web we weave,
    When first we practise to deceive!

_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 17._


    O woman! in our hours of ease
    Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,
    And variable as the shade
    By the light quivering aspen made;
    When pain and anguish wring the brow,
    A ministering angel thou![490-1]

_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 30._


    "Charge, Chester, charge! on, Stanley, on!"
    Were the last words of Marmion.

_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 32._


    Oh for a blast of that dread horn[490-2]
    On Fontarabian echoes borne!

_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 33._


    To all, to each, a fair good-night,
    And pleasing dreams, and slumbers light.

_L' Envoy. To the Reader._


    In listening mood she seemed to stand,
    The guardian Naiad of the strand.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 17._


    And ne'er did Grecian chisel trace
    A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace
    Of finer form or lovelier face.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 18._


    A foot more light, a step more true,
    Ne'er from the heath-flower dash'd the dew.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 18._


    On his bold visage middle age
    Had slightly press'd its signet sage,
    Yet had not quench'd the open truth
    And fiery vehemence of youth:
    Forward and frolic glee was there,
    The will to do, the soul to dare.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 21._


    Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
    Morn of toil nor night of waking.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 31._


    Hail to the chief who in triumph advances!

_Lady of the Lake. Canto ii. Stanza 19._


    Some feelings are to mortals given
    With less of earth in them than heaven.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto ii. Stanza 22._


    Time rolls his ceaseless course.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto iii. Stanza 1._


    Like the dew on the mountain,
      Like the foam on the river,
    Like the bubble on the fountain,
      Thou art gone, and forever!

_Lady of the Lake. Canto iii. Stanza 16._


    The rose is fairest when 't is budding new,
      And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears.
    The rose is sweetest wash'd with morning dew,
      And love is loveliest when embalm'd in tears.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto iv. Stanza 1._


    Art thou a friend to Roderick?

_Lady of the Lake. Canto iv. Stanza 30._


    Come one, come all! this rock shall fly
    From its firm base as soon as I.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto v. Stanza 10._


    And the stern joy which warriors feel
    In foemen worthy of their steel.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto v. Stanza 10._


    Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
    Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!
    Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
    And fickle as a changeful dream;
    Fantastic as a woman's mood,
    And fierce as Frenzy's fever'd blood.
    Thou many-headed monster[492-1] thing,
    Oh who would wish to be thy king!

_Lady of the Lake. Canto v. Stanza 30._


      Where, where was Roderick then?
    One blast upon his bugle horn
      Were worth a thousand men.

_Lady of the Lake. Canto vi. Stanza 18._


    In man's most dark extremity
    Oft succour dawns from Heaven.

_Lord of the Isles. Canto i. Stanza 20._


    Spangling the wave with lights as vain
    As pleasures in the vale of pain,
      That dazzle as they fade.

_Lord of the Isles. Canto i. Stanza 23._


    Oh, many a shaft at random sent
    Finds mark the archer little meant!
    And many a word at random spoken
    May soothe, or wound, a heart that 's broken!

_Lord of the Isles. Canto v. Stanza 18._


    Where lives the man that has not tried
    How mirth can into folly glide,
      And folly into sin!

_Bridal of Triermain. Canto i. Stanza 21._


    Still are the thoughts to memory dear.

_Rokeby. Canto i. Stanza 32._


    A mother's pride, a father's joy.

_Rokeby. Canto iii. Stanza 15._


    Oh, Brignall banks are wild and fair,
      And Greta woods are green,
    And you may gather garlands there
      Would grace a summer's queen.

_Rokeby. Canto iii. Stanza 16._


    Thus aged men, full loth and slow,
    The vanities of life forego,
    And count their youthful follies o'er,
    Till Memory lends her light no more.

_Rokeby. Canto v. Stanza 1._


    No pale gradations quench his ray,
    No twilight dews his wrath allay.

_Rokeby. Canto vi. Stanza 21._


    Come as the winds come, when
      Forests are rended;
    Come as the waves come, when
      Navies are stranded.

_Pibroch of Donald Dhu._


     A lawyer without history or literature is a mechanic, a mere

     venture to call himself an architect.

    Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
      The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye

    Her face, oh call it fair, not pale!

_Christabel. Part ii._


    Alas! they had been friends in youth;
    But whispering tongues can poison truth,
    And constancy lives in realms above;
    And life is thorny, and youth is vain,
    And to be wroth with one we love
    Doth work like madness in the brain.

_Christabel. Part ii._


    They stood aloof, the scars remaining,--
    Like cliffs which had been rent asunder:
    A dreary sea now flows between.

_Christabel. Part ii._


    Perhaps 't is pretty to force together
    Thoughts so all unlike each other;
    To mutter and mock a broken charm,
    To dally with wrong that does no harm.

_Christabel. Conclusion to Part ii._


    In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
    A stately pleasure-dome decree,
    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
    Through caverns measureless to man
      Down to a sunless sea.

_Kubla Khan._


    Ancestral voices prophesying war.

_Kubla Khan._


    A damsel with a dulcimer
    In a vision once I saw:
    It was an Abyssinian maid,
    And on her dulcimer she played,
    Singing of Mount Abora.

_Kubla Khan._


    For he on honey-dew hath fed,
    And drunk the milk of Paradise.

_Kubla Khan._


    Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade,
      Death came with friendly care;
    The opening bud to heaven conveyed,
      And bade it blossom there.



_Epitaph on an Infant._


    Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare,
    And shot my being through earth, sea, and air,
    Possessing all things with intensest love,
    O Liberty! my spirit felt thee there.

_France. An Ode. v._


    Forth from his dark and lonely hiding-place
    (Portentous sight!) the owlet Atheism,
    Sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon,
    Drops his blue-fring'd lids, and holds them close,
    And hooting at the glorious sun in heaven
    Cries out, "Where is it?"

_Fears in Solitude._


    And the Devil did grin, for his darling sin
      Is pride that apes humility.[501-1]

_The Devil's Thoughts._


    All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
    Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
      All are but ministers of Love,
        And feed his sacred flame.

_Love._


    Blest hour! it was a luxury--to be!

_Reflections on having left a Place of Retirement._


                                    A charm
    For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom
    No sound is dissonant which tells of life.

_This Lime-tree Bower my Prison._


    Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star
    In his steep course?

_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._


    Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines.

_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._


    Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!

_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._


    Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost.

_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._


    Earth with her thousand voices praises God.

_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._


    Tranquillity! thou better name
    Than all the family of Fame.

_Ode to Tranquillity._


    The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence.

_Dejection. An Ode. Stanza 1._


    Joy is the sweet voice, joy the luminous cloud.
      We in ourselves rejoice!
    And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight,
      All melodies the echoes of that voice,
    All colours a suffusion from that light.

_Dejection. An Ode. Stanza 5._


    A mother is a mother still,
      The holiest thing alive.

_The Three Graves._


    Never, believe me,
    Appear the Immortals,
    Never alone.

_The Visit of the Gods._ (Imitated from Schiller.)


    Joy rises in me, like a summer's morn.

_A Christmas Carol. viii._


    The knight's bones are dust,
    And his good sword rust;
    His soul is with the saints, I trust.

_The Knight's Tomb._


    It sounds like stories from the land of spirits
    If any man obtains that which he merits,
    Or any merit that which he obtains.
        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    Greatness and goodness are not means, but ends!
    Hath he not always treasures, always friends,
    The good great man? Three treasures,--love and light,
    And calm thoughts, regular as infants' breath;
    And three firm friends, more sure than day and night,--
    Himself, his Maker, and the angel Death.

_Complaint. Ed. 1852. The Good Great Man. Ed. 1893._


    My eyes make pictures when they are shut.

_A Day-Dream._


    To know, to esteem, to love, and then to part,
    Makes up life's tale to many a feeling heart!

_On taking Leave of ----, 1817._


    In many ways doth the full heart reveal
    The presence of the love it would conceal.



_Motto to Poems written in Later Life._


    Nought cared this body for wind or weather
    When youth and I lived in 't together.

_Youth and Age._


    Flowers are lovely; love is flower-like;
    Friendship is a sheltering tree;
    Oh the joys that came down shower-like,
    Of friendship, love, and liberty,
                  Ere I was old!

_Youth and Age._


    I have heard of reasons manifold
      Why Love must needs be blind,
    But this the best of all I hold,--
      His eyes are in his mind.[503-1]

_To a Lady, Offended by a Sportive Observation._


    What outward form and feature are
      He guesseth but in part;
    But what within is good and fair
      He seeth with the heart.

_To a Lady, Offended by a Sportive Observation._


    Be that blind bard who on the Chian strand,
    By those deep sounds possessed with inward light,
    Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssey
    Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea.[503-2]

_Fancy in Nubibus._


    I counted two-and-seventy stenches,
    All well defined, and several stinks.

_Cologne._


    The river Rhine, it is well known,
    Doth wash your city of Cologne;
    But tell me, nymphs! what power divine
    Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?

_Cologne._


    Strongly it bears us along in swelling and limitless billows;
    Nothing before and nothing behind but the sky and the ocean.

_The Homeric Hexameter._ (Translated from Schiller.)


    In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column,
    In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.

_The Ovidian Elegiac Metre._ (From Schiller.)


    I stood in unimaginable trance
    And agony that cannot be remembered.

_Remorse. Act iv. Sc. 3._


    The intelligible forms of ancient poets,
    The fair humanities of old religion,
    The power, the beauty, and the majesty
    That had their haunts in dale or piny mountain,
    Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring,
    Or chasms and watery depths,--all these have vanished;
    They live no longer in the faith of reason.

_Wallenstein. Part i. Act ii. Sc. 4._ (Translated from Schiller.)


    I 've lived and loved.

_Wallenstein. Part i. Act ii. Sc. 6._


    Clothing the palpable and familiar
    With golden exhalations of the dawn.

_The Death of Wallenstein. Act i. Sc. 1._


                       Often do the spirits
    Of great events stride on before the events,
    And in to-day already walks to-morrow.[504-1]

_The Death of Wallenstein. Act v. Sc. 1._


    Our myriad-minded Shakespeare.[504-2]

_Biog. Lit. Chap. xv._


     A dwarf sees farther than the giant when he has the giant's
     shoulder to mount on.[504-3]

_The Friend. Sec. i. Essay 8._


     An instinctive taste teaches men to build their churches in flat
     countries, with spire steeples, which, as they cannot be referred
     to any other object, point as with silent finger to the sky and
     star.[504-4]

_Ibid., No. 14._


     Reviewers are usually people who would have been poets,
     historians, biographers, if they could; they have tried their
     talents at one or the other, and have failed; therefore they turn
     critics.[505-1]

_Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, p. 36. Delivered 1811-1812._


     Schiller has the material sublime.

_Table Talk._


     I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely
     definitions of prose and poetry; that is, prose,--words in their
     best order; poetry,--the best words in their best order.

_Table Talk._


     That passage is what I call the sublime dashed to pieces by
     cutting too close with the fiery four-in-hand round the corner of
     nonsense.

_Table Talk._


     Iago's soliloquy, the motive-hunting of a motiveless
     malignity--how awful it is!

     If this bill [for the admission of Orleans Territory as a State]
     passes, it is my deliberate opinion that it is virtually a
     dissolution of the Union; that it will free the States from their
     moral obligation; and, as it will be the right of all, so it will
     be the duty of some, definitely to prepare for a
     separation,--amicably if they can, violently if they must.[505-2]

      Breaks the serene of heaven:
      In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine

        The desert circle spreads
    Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.

          .      .      .      .      .

    That wondrous soul Charoba once possest,--
    Capacious, then, as earth or heaven could hold,
    Soul discontented with capacity,--
    Is gone (I fear) forever. Need I say
    She was enchanted by the wicked spells
    Of Gebir, whom with lust of power inflamed
    The western winds have landed on our coast?
    I since have watcht her in lone retreat,
    Have heard her sigh and soften out the name.[512-2]

    Weep to record, and blush to give it in.[513-2]

_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 357._


    Cease, every joy, to glimmer on my mind,
    But leave, oh leave the light of Hope behind!
    What though my winged hours of bliss have been
    Like angel visits, few and far between.[514-1]

_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 375._


    The hunter and the deer a shade.[514-2]

_O'Connor's Child. Stanza 5._


    Another's sword has laid him low,
      Another's and another's;
    And every hand that dealt the blow--
      Ah me! it was a brother's!

_O'Connor's Child. Stanza 10._


    'T is the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
    And coming events cast their shadows before.[514-3]

_Lochiel's Warning._


    Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,
    With his back to the field and his feet to the foe,
    And leaving in battle no blot on his name,
    Look proudly to heaven from the death-bed of fame.

_Lochiel's Warning._


    And rustic life and poverty
    Grow beautiful beneath his touch.

_Ode to the Memory of Burns._


    Ye mariners of England,
    That guard our native seas;
    Whose flag has braved, a thousand years,
    The battle and the breeze!

_Ye Mariners of England._


    Britannia needs no bulwarks,
    No towers along the steep;
    Her march is o'er the mountain waves,
    Her home is on the deep.

_Ye Mariners of England._


    When the stormy winds do blow;[515-1]
    When the battle rages loud and long,
    And the stormy winds do blow.

_Ye Mariners of England._


    The meteor flag of England
    Shall yet terrific burn,
    Till danger's troubled night depart,
    And the star of peace return.

_Ye Mariners of England._


    There was silence deep as death,
    And the boldest held his breath
    For a time.

_Battle of the Baltic._


    The combat deepens. On, ye brave,
    Who rush to glory or the grave!
    Wave, Munich! all thy banners wave,
    And charge with all thy chivalry!

_Hohenlinden._


    Few, few shall part where many meet!
    The snow shall be their winding-sheet,
    And every turf beneath their feet
    Shall be a soldier's sepulchre.

_Hohenlinden._


    There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,
      The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
    For his country he sigh'd, when at twilight repairing
      To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.

_The Exile of Erin._


    To bear is to conquer our fate.

_On visiting a Scene in Argyleshire._


    The sentinel stars set their watch in the sky.[515-2]

_The Soldier's Dream._


    In life's morning march, when my bosom was young.

_The Soldier's Dream._


    But sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn,
    And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.

_The Soldier's Dream._


    Triumphal arch, that fill'st the sky
      When storms prepare to part,
    I ask not proud Philosophy
      To teach me what thou art.

_To the Rainbow._


    A stoic of the woods,--a man without a tear.

_Gertrude of Wyoming. Part i. Stanza 23._


    O Love! in such a wilderness as this.

_Gertrude of Wyoming. Part iii. Stanza 1._


    The torrent's smoothness, ere it dash below!

_Gertrude of Wyoming. Part iii. Stanza 5._


    Again to the battle, Achaians!
    Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance!
    Our land, the first garden of Liberty's tree,
    It has been, and shall yet be, the land of the free.

_Song of the Greeks._


    Drink ye to her that each loves best!
      And if you nurse a flame
    That 's told but to her mutual breast,
      We will not ask her name.

_Drink ye to Her._


    To live in hearts we leave behind
    Is not to die.

    The harp that once through Tara's halls
      The soul of music shed,
    Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls
      As if that soul were fled.
    So sleeps the pride of former days,
      So glory's thrill is o'er;
    And hearts that once beat high for praise
      Now feel that pulse no more.

_The Fudges in England. Letter iii._


    Fly not yet; 't is just the hour
    When pleasure, like the midnight flower
    That scorns the eye of vulgar light,
    Begins to bloom for sons of night
      And maids who love the moon.

_Fly not yet._


          Oh stay! oh stay!
    Joy so seldom weaves a chain
    Like this to-night, that oh 't is pain
      To break its links so soon.

_Fly not yet._


    When did morning ever break,
    And find such beaming eyes awake?

_Fly not yet._


    And the heart that is soonest awake to the flowers
      Is always the first to be touch'd by the thorns.

_Oh think not my Spirits are always as light._


    Rich and rare were the gems she wore,
    And a bright gold ring on her wand she bore.

_Rich and rare were the Gems she wore._


    There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet
    As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet.

_The Meeting of the Waters._


              Oh, weep for the hour
              When to Eveleen's bower
    The lord of the valley with false vows came.

_Eveleen's Bower._


    Shall I ask the brave soldier who fights by my side
    In the cause of mankind, if our creeds agree?

_Come, send round the Wine._


    No, the heart that has truly lov'd never forgets,
      But as truly loves on to the close;
    As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
      The same look which she turn'd when he rose.



_Believe me, if all those endearing young Charms._


              The moon looks

    And when once the young heart of a maiden is stolen,
      The maiden herself will steal after it soon.

_Ill Omens._


    'T is sweet to think that where'er we rove
      We are sure to find something blissful and dear;
    And that when we 're far from the lips we love,
      We 've but to make love to the lips we are near.

_'T is sweet to think._


    'T is believ'd that this harp which I wake now for thee
    Was a siren of old who sung under the sea.

_The Origin of the Harp._


    But there 's nothing half so sweet in life
      As love's young dream.

_Love's Young Dream._


    To live with them is far less sweet
      Than to remember thee.[521-2]

_I saw thy Form._


    Eyes of unholy blue.

_By that Lake whose gloomy Shore._


    'T is the last rose of summer,
      Left blooming alone.

_The Last Rose of Summer._


    When true hearts lie wither'd
      And fond ones are flown,
    Oh, who would inhabit
      This bleak world alone?

_The Last Rose of Summer._


                 And the best of all ways
                 To lengthen our days
    Is to steal a few hours from the night, my dear.

_The Young May Moon._


    You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,
    But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.

_Farewell! But whenever you welcome the Hour._


    Thus, when the lamp that lighted
      The traveller at first goes out,
    He feels awhile benighted,
      And looks around in fear and doubt.
    But soon, the prospect clearing,
      By cloudless starlight on he treads,
    And thinks no lamp so cheering
      As that light which Heaven sheds.

_I 'd mourn the Hopes._


    No eye to watch, and no tongue to wound us,
    All earth forgot, and all heaven around us.

_Come o'er the Sea._


    The light that lies
    In woman's eyes.

_The Time I 've lost in wooing._


            My only books
            Were woman's looks,--
    And folly 's all they 've taught me.

_The Time I 've lost in wooing._


    I know not, I ask not, if guilt 's in that heart,
    I but know that I love thee whatever thou art.

_Come, rest in this Bosom._


    To live and die in scenes like this,
      With some we 've left behind us.

_As slow our Ship._


    Wert thou all that I wish thee, great, glorious, and free,
    First flower of the earth and first gem of the sea.

_Remember Thee._


    All that 's bright must fade,--
      The brightest still the fleetest;
    All that 's sweet was made
      But to be lost when sweetest.



_All that 's Bright must fade._


    Those evening bells! those evening bells!
    How many a tale their music tells
    Of youth and home, and that sweet time
    When last I heard their soothing chime!

_Those Evening Bells._


    Oft in the stilly night,
      Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
    Fond memory brings the light
      Of other days around me;
        The smiles, the tears,
        Of boyhood's years,
    The words of love then spoken;
        The eyes that shone
        Now dimmed and gone,
    The cheerful hearts now broken.

_Oft in the Stilly Night._


        I feel like one
        Who treads alone
    Some banquet-hall deserted,
        Whose lights are fled,
        Whose garlands dead,
    And all but he departed.

_Oft in the Stilly Night._


    As half in shade and half in sun
      This world along its path advances,
    May that side the sun 's upon
      Be all that e'er shall meet thy glances!

_Peace be around Thee._


    If I speak to thee in friendship's name,
      Thou think'st I speak too coldly;
    If I mention love's devoted flame,
      Thou say'st I speak too boldly.

_How shall I woo?_


    A friendship that like love is warm;
      A love like friendship, steady.

_How shall I woo?_


    The bird let loose in Eastern skies,
      Returning fondly home,
    Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies
      Where idle warblers roam;
    But high she shoots through air and light,
      Above all low delay,
    Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,
      Nor shadow dims her way.

_Oh that I had Wings._


    This world is all a fleeting show,
      For man's illusion given;
    The smiles of joy, the tears of woe,
    Deceitful shine, deceitful flow,--
      There 's nothing true but Heaven.

_This World is all a fleeting Show._


    Sound the loud timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea!
    Jehovah has triumph'd,--his people are free.

_Sound the loud Timbrel._


    As down in the sunless retreats of the ocean
      Sweet flowers are springing no mortal can see,
    So deep in my soul the still prayer of devotion,
      Unheard by the world, rises silent to Thee.

    As still to the star of its worship, though clouded,
      The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea,
    So dark when I roam in this wintry world shrouded,
      The hope of my spirit turns trembling to Thee.

_The Heart's Prayer._


    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
    Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.

_Come, ye Disconsolate._


    Oh call it by some better name,
      For friendship sounds too cold.

_Oh call it by some better Name._


    When twilight dews are falling soft
      Upon the rosy sea, love,
    I watch the star whose beam so oft
      Has lighted me to thee, love.



_When Twilight Dews._


    I give thee all,--I can no more,
      Though poor the off'ring be;
    My heart and lute are all the store
      That I can bring to thee.[525-1]

_My Heart and Lute._


    Who has not felt how sadly sweet
      The dream of home, the dream of home,
    Steals o'er the heart, too soon to fleet,
      When far o'er sea or land we roam?

_The Dream of Home._


    To Greece we give our shining blades.

_Evenings in Greece. First Evening._


    When thus the heart is in a vein
    Of tender thought, the simplest strain
    Can touch it with peculiar power.

_Evenings in Greece. First Evening._


    If thou would'st have me sing and play
      As once I play'd and sung,
    First take this time-worn lute away,
      And bring one freshly strung.

_If Thou would'st have Me sing and play._


    To sigh, yet feel no pain;
      To weep, yet scarce know why;
    To sport an hour with Beauty's chain,
      Then throw it idly by.

_The Blue Stocking._


    Ay, down to the dust with them, slaves as they are!
      From this hour let the blood in their dastardly veins,
    That shrunk at the first touch of Liberty's war,
      Be wasted for tyrants, or stagnate in chains.

_On the Entry of the Austrians into Naples, 1821._


    This narrow isthmus 'twixt two boundless seas,
    The past, the future,--two eternities!

_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._


    But Faith, fanatic Faith, once wedded fast
    To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last.

_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._


    There 's a bower of roses by Bendemeer's stream.

_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._


    Like the stain'd web that whitens in the sun,
    Grow pure by being purely shone upon.

_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._


    One morn a Peri at the gate
    Of Eden stood disconsolate.

_Paradise and the Peri._


    Take all the pleasures of all the spheres,
    And multiply each through endless years,--
    One minute of heaven is worth them all.

_Paradise and the Peri._


    But the trail of the serpent is over them all.

_Paradise and the Peri._


    Oh, ever thus, from childhood's hour,
      I 've seen my fondest hopes decay;
    I never loved a tree or flower
      But 't was the first to fade away.
    I never nurs'd a dear gazelle,
      To glad me with its soft black eye,
    But when it came to know me well
      And love me, it was sure to die.

_The Fire-Worshippers._


    Oh for a tongue to curse the slave
      Whose treason, like a deadly blight,
    Comes o'er the councils of the brave,
      And blasts them in their hour of might!

_The Fire-Worshippers._


    Beholding heaven, and feeling hell.

_The Fire-Worshippers._


    As sunshine broken in the rill,
    Though turned astray, is sunshine still.

_The Fire-Worshippers._


    Farewell, farewell to thee, Araby's daughter!
    Thus warbled a Peri beneath the dark sea.

_The Fire-Worshippers._


    Alas! how light a cause may move
    Dissension between hearts that love!
    Hearts that the world in vain had tried,
    And sorrow but more closely tied;
    That stood the storm when waves were rough,
    Yet in a sunny hour fall off,
    Like ships that have gone down at sea
    When heaven was all tranquillity.

_Lalla Rookh. The Light of the Harem._


    Love on through all ills, and love on till they die.

_Lalla Rookh. The Light of the Harem._


    And oh if there be an Elysium on earth,
            It is this, it is this!

_Lalla Rookh. The Light of the Harem._


    Humility, that low, sweet root
    From which all heavenly virtues shoot.

CHARLES MINER. 1780-1865.

     When I see a merchant over-polite to his customers, begging them
     to taste a little brandy and throwing half his goods on the
     counter,--thinks I, that man has an axe to grind.

JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1782-1850.

     The very essence of a free government consists in considering
     offices as public trusts,[529-1] bestowed for the good of the
     country, and not for the benefit of an individual or a party.

_Speech, Feb. 13, 1835._


     A power has risen up in the government greater than the people
     themselves, consisting of many and various and powerful
     interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the
     cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.[529-2]

_Speech, May 27, 1836._

DANIEL WEBSTER. 1782-1852.

(_From Webster's Works. Boston. 1857._)

     Whatever makes men good Christians, makes them good citizens.

_Speech at Plymouth, Dec. 22, 1820._[529-3] _Vol. i. p. 44._


     We wish that this column, rising towards heaven among the pointed
     spires of so many temples dedicated to God, may contribute also
     to produce in all minds a pious feeling of dependence and
     gratitude. We wish, finally, that the last object to the sight of
     him who leaves his native shore, and the first to gladden his who
     revisits it, may be something which shall remind him of the
     liberty and the glory of his country. Let it rise! let it rise,
     till it meet the sun in his coming; let the earliest light of the
     morning gild it, and parting day linger and play on its summit!

_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825. P.
62._


     Venerable men! you have come down to us from a former generation.
     Heaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives, that you might
     behold this joyous day.

_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 64._


     Mind is the great lever of all things; human thought is the
     process by which human ends are ultimately answered.

_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 71._


     Knowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and
     power are scattered with all its beams.

_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 74._


     Let our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but
     our country.

_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 78._


     Knowledge is the only fountain both of the love and the
     principles of human liberty.

_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 93._


     The Bible is a book of faith, and a book of doctrine, and a book
     of morals, and a book of religion, of especial revelation from
     God.

_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 102._


     America has furnished to the world the character of Washington.
     And if our American institutions had done nothing else, that
     alone would have entitled them to the respect of mankind.

_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 105._


     Thank God! I--I also--am an American!

_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 107._


     Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and

     my dying sentiment,--Independence now and Independence
     forever.[531-1]

_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. Vol. i. p. 136._


     Although no sculptured marble should rise to their memory, nor
     engraved stone bear record of their deeds, yet will their
     remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored.

_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. Vol. i. p. 146._


     Washington is in the clear upper sky.[531-2]

_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. Vol. i. p. 148._


     He smote the rock of the national resources, and abundant streams

     I have read their platform, and though I think there are some
     unsound places in it, I can stand upon it pretty well. But I see
     nothing in it both new and valuable. "What is valuable is not
     new, and what is new is not valuable."

_Speech at Marshfield, Sept. 1, 1848. P. 433._


     Labour in this country is independent and proud. It has not to
     ask the patronage of capital, but capital solicits the aid of
     labor.

_Speech, April, 1824. Vol. iii. p. 141._


     The gentleman has not seen how to reply to this, otherwise than
     by supposing me to have advanced the doctrine that a national
     debt is a national blessing.[532-1]

_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 303._


     I thank God, that if I am gifted with little of the spirit which
     is able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as I
     trust, of that other spirit which would drag angels down.

_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 316._


     I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts; she needs none.
     There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is her
     history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is
     secure. There is Boston and Concord and Lexington and Bunker
     Hill; and there they will remain forever.

_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 317._


     The people's government, made for the people, made by the people,
     and answerable to the people.[532-2]

_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 321._


     When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time the sun
     in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored
     fragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered,
     discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or
     drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood.

_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. Vol. iii. p. 342._


     Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.

_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. Vol. iii. p. 342._


     God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always
     ready to guard and defend it.

_Speech, June 3, 1834. Vol. iv. p. 47._


     On this question of principle, while actual suffering was yet
     afar off, they [the Colonies] raised their flag against a power
     to which, for purposes of foreign conquest and subjugation, Rome
     in the height of her glory is not to be compared,--a power which
     has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her
     possessions and military posts, whose morning drum-beat,
     following the sun,[533-1] and keeping company with the hours,
     circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of the
     martial airs of England.[533-2]

_Speech, May 7, 1834. P. 110._


     Inconsistencies of opinion, arising from changes of
     circumstances, are often justifiable.

_Speech, July 25 and 27, 1846. Vol. v. p. 187._


     I was born an American; I will live an American; I shall die an
     American.[533-3]

_Speech, July 17, 1850. P. 437._


     There is no refuge from confession but suicide; and suicide is
     confession.

_Argument on the Murder of Captain White, April 6, 1830. Vol. vi. p. 54._




     There is nothing so powerful as truth,--and often nothing so
     strange.

_Argument on the Murder of Captain White. Vol. vi. p. 68._


     Fearful concatenation of circumstances.[534-1]

_Argument on the Murder of Captain White. Vol. vi. p. 88._


     A sense of duty pursues us ever. It is omnipresent, like the
     Deity. If we take to ourselves the wings of the morning, and
     dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, duty performed or duty
     violated is still with us, for our happiness or our misery. If we
     say the darkness shall cover us, in the darkness as in the light
     our obligations are yet with us.

_Argument on the Murder of Captain White. Vol. vi. p. 105._


     I shall defer my visit to Faneuil Hall, the cradle of American
     liberty, until its doors shall fly open on golden hinges to
     lovers of Union as well as lovers of liberty.[534-2]

_Letter, April, 1851._

_Marco Bozzaris._


    Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
      Come to the mother's, when she feels
    For the first time her first-born's breath!
      Come when the blessed seals
    That close the pestilence are broke,
    And crowded cities wail its stroke!
    Come in consumption's ghastly form,
    The earthquake shock, the ocean storm!
    Come when the heart beats high and warm,
      With banquet song, and dance, and wine!
    And thou art terrible!--the tear,
    The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
    And all we know or dream or fear
      Of agony are thine.

    Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
      The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
    Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams

_Translation of Calderon's Magico Prodigioso. Scene i._


    How wonderful is Death!
    Death and his brother Sleep.

_Queen Mab. i._


    Power, like a desolating pestilence,
    Pollutes whate'er it touches; and obedience,
    Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,
    Makes slaves of men, and of the human frame
    A mechanized automaton.

_Queen Mab. iii._


                   Heaven's ebon vault
    Studded with stars unutterably bright,
    Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,
    Seems like a canopy which love has spread
    To curtain her sleeping world.

_Queen Mab. iv._


     Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the
     mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the
     present.[568-1]

J. HOWARD PAYNE. 1792-1852.

    'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,

    A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
    Which sought through the world is ne'er met with elsewhere.

    An exile from home splendour dazzles in vain,
    Oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again;

    Give me them, and that peace of mind dearer than all.

SEBA SMITH. 1792-1868.

    The cold winds swept the mountain-height,
      And pathless was the dreary wild,
    And 'mid the cheerless hours of night
      A mother wandered with her child:
    As through the drifting snows she press'd,
    The babe was sleeping on her breast.

_The Snow Storm._





JOHN KEBLE. 1792-1866.

    The trivial round, the common task,
    Would furnish all we ought to ask.

_Morning._


    Why should we faint and fear to live alone,
      Since all alone, so Heaven has willed, we die?
    Nor even the tenderest heart, and next our own,
      Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh.

_The Christian Year. Twenty-fourth Sunday after Trinity._


    'T is sweet, as year by year we lose
    Friends out of sight, in faith to muse
    How grows in Paradise our store.

_Burial of the Dead._


    Abide with me from morn till eve,
    For without Thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without Thee I dare not die.

_Evening._





FELICIA D. HEMANS. 1794-1835.

    The stately homes of England,--
      How beautiful they stand,
    Amid their tall ancestral trees,
      O'er all the pleasant land!

_The Homes of England._


    The breaking waves dashed high
      On a stern and rock-bound coast,
    And the woods against a stormy sky
      Their giant branches tossed.

_Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._


    What sought they thus afar?
      Bright jewels of the mine,
    The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
      They sought a faith's pure shrine.



_Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._


    Ay, call it holy ground,
      The soil where first they trod:
    They have left unstained what there they found,--
      Freedom to worship God.

_Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._


    Through the laburnum's dropping gold
    Rose the light shaft of Orient mould,
    And Europe's violets, faintly sweet,
    Purpled the mossbeds at its feet.

_The Palm-Tree._


    They grew in beauty side by side,
      They filled one home with glee:
    Their graves are severed far and wide
      By mount and stream and sea.

_The Graves of a Household._


    Alas for love, if thou wert all,
      And naught beyond, O Earth!

_The Graves of a Household._


    The boy stood on the burning deck,
      Whence all but him had fled;
    The flame that lit the battle's wreck
      Shone round him o'er the dead.

_Casabianca._


          Leaves have their time to fall,
    And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath,
          And stars to set; but all,
    Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!

_The Hour of Death._


    Come to the sunset tree!
      The day is past and gone;
    The woodman's axe lies free,
      And the reaper's work is done.

_Tyrolese Evening Song._


    In the busy haunts of men.

_Tale of the Secret Tribunal. Part i._


    Calm on the bosom of thy God,
      Fair spirit, rest thee now!



_Siege of Valencia. Scene ix._


    Oh, call my brother back to me!
      I cannot play alone:
    The summer comes with flower and bee,--
      Where is my brother gone?

_The Child's First Grief._


    I have looked on the hills of the stormy North,
    And the larch has hung his tassels forth.

_The Voice of Spring._


    I had a hat. It was not all a hat,--
    Part of the brim was gone:
    Yet still I wore it on.

_Rhine Song of the German Soldiers after Victory._





EDWARD EVERETT. 1794-1865.

    When I am dead, no pageant train
      Shall waste their sorrows at my bier,
    Nor worthless pomp of homage vain
      Stain it with hypocritic tear.

_Alaric the Visigoth._


    You shall not pile, with servile toil,
      Your monuments upon my breast,
    Nor yet within the common soil
      Lay down the wreck of power to rest,
    Where man can boast that he has trod
    On him that was "the scourge of God."

_Alaric the Visigoth._


     No gilded dome swells from the lowly roof to catch the morning or
     evening beam; but the love and gratitude of united America settle
     upon it in one eternal sunshine. From beneath that humble roof
     went forth the intrepid and unselfish warrior, the magistrate who
     knew no glory but his country's good; to that he returned,
     happiest when his work was done. There he lived in noble
     simplicity, there he died in glory and peace. While it stands,
     the latest generations of the grateful children of America will
     make this pilgrimage to it as to a shrine; and when it shall
     fall, if fall it must, the memory and the name of Washington
     shall shed an eternal glory on the spot.

_Oration on the Character of Washington._





WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 1794-1878.

    Here the free spirit of mankind, at length,
    Throws its last fetters off; and who shall place
    A limit to the giant's unchained strength,
    Or curb his swiftness in the forward race?

_The Ages. xxxiii._


    To him who in the love of Nature holds
    Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
    A various language.

_Thanatopsis._


    Go forth under the open sky, and list
    To Nature's teachings.

_Thanatopsis._


                            The hills,
    Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun.

_Thanatopsis._


    Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste.

_Thanatopsis._


                            All that tread
    The globe are but a handful to the tribes
    That slumber in its bosom.

_Thanatopsis._


    So live, that when thy summons comes to join
    The innumerable caravan which moves[572-1]
    To that mysterious realm where each shall take
    His chamber in the silent halls of death,
    Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
    Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed
    By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
    Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch
    About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

_Thanatopsis._


    The groves were God's first temples.

_A Forest Hymn._


    The stormy March has come at last,
      With winds and clouds and changing skies;
    I hear the rushing of the blast
      That through the snowy valley flies.

_March._


      But 'neath yon crimson tree
    Lover to listening maid might breathe his flame,
    Nor mark, within its roseate canopy,
      Her blush of maiden shame.

_Autumn Woods._


    The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,
    Of wailing winds and naked woods and meadows brown and sear.

_The Death of the Flowers._


    And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.

_The Death of the Flowers._


    Loveliest of lovely things are they
    On earth that soonest pass away.
    The rose that lives its little hour
    Is prized beyond the sculptured flower.

_A Scene on the Banks of the Hudson._


    The victory of endurance born.

_The Battle-Field._


    Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,--
      The eternal years of God are hers;
    But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
      And dies among his worshippers.

_The Battle-Field._

JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE. 1795-1820.

    When Freedom from her mountain-height
      Unfurled her standard to the air,
    She tore the azure robe of night,
      And set the stars of glory there.
    She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
    The milky baldric of the skies,
    And striped its pure, celestial white
    With streakings of the morning light.

    Flag of the free heart's hope and home!
      By angel hands to valour given!
    Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
      And all thy hues were born in heaven.
    Forever float that standard sheet!
      Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
    With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,
      And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us?

_The American Flag._





JOHN KEATS. 1795-1821.

    A thing of beauty is a joy forever;
    Its loveliness increases; it will never
    Pass into nothingness.

_Endymion. Book i._


                     He ne'er is crown'd
    With immortality, who fears to follow
    Where airy voices lead.

_Endymion. Book ii._


        To sorrow
        I bade good-morrow,
    And thought to leave her far away behind;
        But cheerly, cheerly,
        She loves me dearly;
    She is so constant to me, and so kind.

_Endymion. Book iv._


    So many, and so many, and such glee.

_Endymion. Book iv._


    Love in a hut, with water and a crust,
    Is--Love, forgive us!--cinders, ashes, dust.

_Lamia. Part ii._


    There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
    We know her woof, her texture; she is given
    In the dull catalogue of common things.
    Philosophy will clip an angel's wings.



_Lamia. Part ii._


                        Music's golden tongue
    Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 3._


    The silver snarling trumpets 'gan to chide.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 4._


    Asleep in lap of legends old.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 15._


    Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,
    Flushing his brow.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 16._


    A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 18._


    As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 27._


    And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.

_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 30._

_Hyperion. Book i._


    Those green-robed senators of mighty woods,
    Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
    Dream, and so dream all night without a stir.

_Hyperion. Book i._


    The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled.

_Hyperion. Book ii._


    Dance and Provençal song and sunburnt mirth!
    Oh for a beaker full of the warm South,
    Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene!
    With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
    And purple-stainèd mouth.

_Ode to a Nightingale._


    Through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home
    She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
      The same that ofttimes hath
    Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
    Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.



_Ode to a Nightingale._


    Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time.

_Ode on a Grecian Urn._


    Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
      Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on,--
    Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
      Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone.

_Ode on a Grecian Urn._


    Thou, silent form, doth tease us out of thought
      As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!

_Ode on a Grecian Urn._


    Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all
      Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

_Ode on a Grecian Urn._


    In a drear-nighted December,
      Too happy, happy tree,
    Thy branches ne'er remember
      Their green felicity.

_Stanzas._


                Hear ye not the hum
    Of mighty workings?

_Addressed to Haydon. Sonnet x._


    Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
      And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
      Round many western islands have I been
    Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
    Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
      That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne,
      Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
    Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
    Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
      When a new planet swims into his ken;
    Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
      He stared at the Pacific, and all his men
    Look'd at each other with a wild surmise,
      Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

_On first looking into Chapman's Homer._


    E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
    That falls through the clear ether silently.



_To One who has been long in City pent._


    The poetry of earth is never dead.

_On the Grasshopper and Cricket._


    Here lies one whose name was writ in water.[577-1]

THOMAS NOON TALFOURD. 1795-1854.

                       So his life has flowed
    From its mysterious urn a sacred stream,
    In whose calm depth the beautiful and pure
    Alone are mirrored; which, though shapes of ill
    May hover round its surface, glides in light,
    And takes no shadow from them.

_Ion. Act i. Sc. 1._


                       'T is a little thing
    To give a cup of water; yet its draught
    Of cool refreshment, drained by fevered lips,
    May give a shock of pleasure to the frame
    More exquisite than when nectarean juice
    Renews the life of joy in happiest hours.

_Ion. Act i. Sc. 2._





THOMAS CARLYLE. 1795-1881.

     Except by name, Jean Paul Friedrich Richter is little known out
     of Germany. The only thing connected with him, we think, that has
     reached this country is his saying,--imported by Madame de Staël,
     and thankfully pocketed by most newspaper critics,--"Providence
     has given to the French the empire of the land; to the English
     that of the sea; to the Germans that of--the air!"

_Richter. Edinburgh Review, 1827._


     Literary men are . . . a perpetual priesthood.

_State of German Literature. Edinburgh Review, 1827._


     Clever men are good, but they are not the best.

_Goethe. Edinburgh Review, 1828._


     We are firm believers in the maxim that for all right judgment of
     any man or thing it is useful, nay, essential, to see his good
     qualities before pronouncing on his bad.

_Goethe. Edinburgh Review, 1828._


     How does the poet speak to men with power, but by being still
     more a man than they?

_Burns. Edinburgh Review, 1828._


     A poet without love were a physical and metaphysical
     impossibility.

_Burns. Edinburgh Review, 1828._


     His religion at best is an anxious wish,--like that of Rabelais,
     a great Perhaps.

_Burns. Edinburgh Review, 1828._


     We have oftener than once endeavoured to attach some meaning to
     that aphorism, vulgarly imputed to Shaftesbury, which however we
     can find nowhere in his works, that "ridicule is the test of
     truth."[578-1]

_Voltaire. Foreign Review, 1829._


     We must repeat the often repeated saying, that it is unworthy a
     religious man to view an irreligious one either with alarm or
     aversion, or with any other feeling than regret and hope and
     brotherly commiseration.

_Voltaire. Foreign Review, 1829._


     There is no heroic poem in the world but is at bottom a
     biography, the life of a man; also it may be said, there is no
     life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its
     sort, rhymed or unrhymed.

_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._


     Silence is deep as Eternity, speech is shallow as Time.

_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._

     Blessed is the healthy nature; it is the coherent, sweetly
     co-operative, not incoherent, self-distracting, self-destructive
     one!

_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._


     The uttered part of a man's life, let us always repeat, bears to
     the unuttered, unconscious part a small unknown proportion. He
     himself never knows it, much less do others.

_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._


     Literature is the Thought of thinking Souls.

_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._


     It can be said of him, when he departed he took a Man's life with
     him. No sounder piece of British manhood was put together in that
     eighteenth century of Time.

     Eternity.

_Sartor Resartus. Book iii. Chap. iii._


     The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of
     none.[579-3]

_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Prophet._


     In books lies the soul of the whole Past Time: the articulate
     audible voice of the Past, when the body and material substance
     of it has altogether vanished like a dream.

_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Man of Letters._

THOMAS HOOD. 1798-1845.

    There is a silence where hath been no sound,
    There is a silence where no sound may be,--
    In the cold grave, under the deep, deep sea,
    Or in the wide desert where no life is found.

_Sonnet. Silence._


    We watch'd her breathing through the night,
      Her breathing soft and low,
    As in her breast the wave of life
      Kept heaving to and fro.

_The Death-Bed._


    Our very hopes belied our fears,
      Our fears our hopes belied;
    We thought her dying when she slept,
      And sleeping when she died.

_The Death-Bed._


    I remember, I remember
    The fir-trees dark and high;
    I used to think their slender tops
    Were close against the sky;
    It was a childish ignorance,
    But now 't is little joy
    To know I 'm farther off from heaven
    Than when I was a boy.

_I remember, I remember._


    She stood breast-high amid the corn
    Clasp'd by the golden light of morn,
    Like the sweetheart of the sun,
    Who many a glowing kiss had won.

_Ruth._


    Thus she stood amid the stooks,
    Praising God with sweetest looks.

        When he is forsaken,

    What can an old man do but die?

_Spring it is cheery._

    That makes the heart afraid.

_Ode to Melancholy._


    There 's not a string attuned to mirth

_Ode to Melancholy._


    But evil is wrought by want of thought,
    As well as want of heart.

_The Lady's Dream._


    Oh would I were dead now,

    To cover my head now,
      And have a good cry!

_A Table of Errata._


    Straight down the crooked lane,
    And all round the square.

      And now of a Bloody Mary.

_Her Moral._

_The Season._


    With fingers weary and worn,
      With eyelids heavy and red,

_The Song of the Shirt._

_The Bridge of Sighs._


    Take her up tenderly,
      Lift her with care;
    Fashioned so slenderly,
      Young, and so fair!

_The Bridge of Sighs._


    Alas for the rarity
    Of Christian charity
      Under the sun!

_The Bridge of Sighs._


    Even God's providence
      Seeming estrang'd.

_The Bridge of Sighs._


    No sun, no moon, no morn, no noon,
    No dawn, no dusk, no proper time of day,
         .     .     .     .     .     .
    No road, no street, no t' other side the way,
         .     .     .     .     .     .
    No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,
    No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no buds.

_November._


    No solemn sanctimonious face I pull,
      Nor think I 'm pious when I 'm only bilious;
      Nor study in my sanctum supercilious,
    To frame a Sabbath Bill or forge a Bull.

_Ode to Rae Wilson._


    The Quaker loves an ample brim,
      A hat that bows to no salaam;
    And dear the beaver is to him
      As if it never made a dam.

_All round my Hat._

GEORGE LINLEY. 1798-1865.

    Ever of thee I 'm fondly dreaming,
    Thy gentle voice my spirit can cheer.



_Ever of Thee._


    Thou art gone from my gaze like a beautiful dream,
    And I seek thee in vain by the meadow and stream.

_Thou art gone._


    Tho' lost to sight, to mem'ry dear
      Thou ever wilt remain;
    One only hope my heart can cheer,--
      The hope to meet again.

    Oh fondly on the past I dwell,
      And oft recall those hours
    When, wand'ring down the shady dell,
      We gathered the wild-flowers.

    Yes, life then seem'd one pure delight,
      Tho' now each spot looks drear;
    Yet tho' thy smile be lost to sight,
      To mem'ry thou art dear.

    Oft in the tranquil hour of night,
      When stars illume the sky,
    I gaze upon each orb of light,
      And wish that thou wert by.

    I think upon that happy time,
      That time so fondly lov'd,
    When last we heard the sweet bells chime,
      As thro' the fields we rov'd.

    Yes, life then seem'd one pure delight,
      Tho' now each spot looks drear;
    Yet tho' thy smile be lost to sight,
      To mem'ry thou art dear.

_Song._[587-1]


FOOTNOTES:

[587-1] This song--written and composed by Linley for Mr. Augustus
    Braham, and sung by him--is given entire, as so much inquiry has
    been made for the source of "Though lost to Sight, to Memory
    dear." It is not known when the song was written,--probably about
    1830.

    Another song, entitled "Though lost to Sight, to Memory dear," was
    published in London in 1880, purporting to have been "written by
    Ruthven Jenkyns in 1703." It is said to have been published in the
    "Magazine for Mariners." No such magazine, however, ever existed,
    and the composer of the music acknowledged, in a private letter,
    to have copied the song from an American newspaper. There is no
    other authority for the origin of this song, and the reputed
    author, Ruthven Jenkyns, was living, under the name of C----, in
    California in 1882.

FOOTNOTES:

[588-1] There is a well-authenticated anecdote of Cromwell. On a
    certain occasion, when his troops were about crossing a river to
    attack the enemy, he concluded an address, couched in the usual
    fanatic terms in use among them, with these words: "Put your trust
    in God; but mind to keep your powder dry!"--HAYES: _Ballads of

_The Course of Time. Book viii. Line 616._


                  With one hand he put
    A penny in the urn of poverty,
    And with the other took a shilling out.

RUFUS CHOATE. 1799-1859.

     There was a state without king or nobles; there was a church

     magistrates which it had selected, and by equal laws which it had
     framed.

[589-1] Although Mr. Choate has usually been credited with the
    original utterance of the words "glittering generalities," the
    following quotation will show that he was anticipated therein by
    several years:--

    We fear that the glittering generalities of the speaker have left
    an impression more delightful than permanent.--FRANKLIN J.

(_From his Essays._)

     That is the best government which desires to make the people
     happy, and knows how to make them happy.

_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._


     Free trade, one of the greatest blessings which a government can
     confer on a people, is in almost every country unpopular.

_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._


     The history of nations, in the sense in which I use the word, is
     often best studied in works not professedly historical.

_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._


     Wherever literature consoles sorrow or assuages pain; wherever it
     brings gladness to eyes which fail with wakefulness and tears,
     and ache for the dark house and the long sleep,--there is
     exhibited in its noblest form the immortal influence of Athens.

_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._


     We hold that the most wonderful and splendid proof of genius is a
     great poem produced in a civilized age.

_On Milton. 1825._


     Nobles by the right of an earlier creation, and priests by the
     imposition of a mightier hand.

     Out of his surname they have coined an epithet for a knave, and
     out of his Christian name a synonym for the Devil.[590-1]

_On Machiavelli. 1825._


     The English Bible,--a book which if everything else in our
     language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole
     extent of its beauty and power.

_On John Dryden. 1828._


     His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him
     to run, though not to soar.

_On John Dryden. 1828._


     A man possessed of splendid talents, which he often abused, and
     of a sound judgment, the admonitions of which he often neglected;
     a man who succeeded only in an inferior department of his art,
     but who in that department succeeded pre-eminently.

_On John Dryden. 1828._


     He had a head which statuaries loved to copy, and a foot the
     deformity of which the beggars in the streets mimicked.

_On Moore's Life of Lord Byron. 1830._


     We know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one
     of its periodical fits of morality.

_On Moore's Life of Lord Byron. 1830._


     From the poetry of Lord Byron they drew a system of ethics
     compounded of misanthropy and voluptuousness,--a system in which
     the two great commandments were to hate your neighbour and to
     love your neighbour's wife.

_On Moore's Life of Lord Byron. 1830._


     That wonderful book, while it obtains admiration from the most
     fastidious critics, is loved by those who are too simple to
     admire it.

_On Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. 1831._


     The conformation of his mind was such that whatever was little
     seemed to him great, and whatever was great seemed to him little.

_On Horace Walpole. 1833._


     What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable man!--To
     be regarded in his own age as a classic, and in ours as a
     companion! To receive from his contemporaries that full homage
     which men of genius have in general received only from posterity;
     to be more intimately known to posterity than other men are known
     to their contemporaries!

     Temple was a man of the world amongst men of letters, a man of

_On Sir William Temple. 1838._


     She [the Roman Catholic Church] may still exist in undiminished
     vigour when some traveller from New Zealand shall, in the midst
     of a vast solitude, take his stand on a broken arch of London
     Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's.[591-2]

_On Ranke's History of the Popes. 1840._


     The chief-justice was rich, quiet, and infamous.

_On Warren Hastings. 1841._


     In that temple of silence and reconciliation where the enmities
     of twenty generations lie buried, in the great Abbey which has
     during many ages afforded a quiet resting-place to those whose
     minds and bodies have been shattered by the contentions of the
     Great Hall.

_On Warren Hastings. 1841._


     In order that he might rob a neighbour whom he had promised to
     defend, black men fought on the coast of Coromandel and red men
     scalped each other by the great lakes of North America.

_On Frederic the Great. 1842._


     We hardly know an instance of the strength and weakness of human
     nature so striking and so grotesque as the character of this
     haughty, vigilant, resolute, sagacious blue-stocking, half
     Mithridates and half Trissotin, bearing up against a world in
     arms, with an ounce of poison in one pocket and a quire of bad
     verses in the other.

_On Frederic the Great. 1842._


     I shall cheerfully bear the reproach of having descended below
     the dignity of history.[593-1]

_History of England. Vol. i. Chap. i._


     There were gentlemen and there were seamen in the navy of Charles
     II. But the seamen were not gentlemen, and the gentlemen were not
     seamen.

     The Puritan hated bear-baiting, not because it gave pain to the

_History of England. Vol. i. Chap. iii._


     I have not the Chancellor's encyclopedic mind. He is indeed a
     kind of semi-Solomon. He _half_ knows everything, from the cedar
     to the hyssop.

_Letter to Macvey Napier, Dec. 17, 1830._


    To every man upon this earth
      Death cometh soon or late;
    And how can man die better
      Than facing fearful odds
    For the ashes of his fathers
      And the temples of his gods?

    What cities, as great as this, have . . . promised themselves
    immortality! Posterity can hardly trace the situation of some. The
    sorrowful traveller wanders over the awful ruins of others. . . .
    Here stood their citadel, but now grown over with weeds; there
    their senate-house, but now the haunt of every noxious reptile;
    temples and theatres stood here, now only an undistinguished heap
    of ruins.--GOLDSMITH: _The Bee, No. iv._ (1759.) _A City Night

    Who knows but that hereafter some traveller like myself will sit
    down upon the banks of the Seine, the Thames, or the Zuyder Zee,
    where now, in the tumult of enjoyment, the heart and the eyes are
    too slow to take in the multitude of sensations? Who knows but he
    will sit down solitary amid silent ruins, and weep a people
    inurned and their greatness changed into an empty name?--VOLNEY:

    That marks where stood her capitols, and hears
    The bittern booming in the weeds, he shrinks

    HENRY KIRKE WHITE: _Time._


    In the firm expectation that when London shall be a habitation of
    bitterns, when St. Paul and Westminster Abbey shall stand
    shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh,
    when the piers of Waterloo Bridge shall become the nuclei of
    islets of reeds and osiers, and cast the jagged shadows of their
    broken arches on the solitary stream, some Transatlantic
    commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now
    unimagined system of criticism the respective merits of the Bells
    and the Fudges and their historians.--SHELLEY: _Dedication to
    Peter Bell._

    Old Grimes is dead, that good old man
      We never shall see more;

      All buttoned down before.[596-1]

_Old Grimes._


FOOTNOTES:

[596-1]
        John Lee is dead, that good old man,--
          We ne'er shall see him more;
        He used to wear an old drab coat
          All buttoned down before.
    To the memory of John Lee, who died May 21, 1823.

LYDIA MARIA CHILD. 1802-1880.

     England may as well dam up the waters of the Nile with bulrushes
     as to fetter the step of Freedom, more proud and firm in this
     youthful land than where she treads the sequestered glens of
     Scotland, or couches herself among the magnificent mountains of
     Switzerland.

     The best thing I know between France and England is the sea.

_The Anglo-French Alliance._


     The life of the husbandman,--a life fed by the bounty of earth
     and sweetened by the airs of heaven.

_The Husbandman's Life._


     Some people are so fond of ill-luck that they run half-way to
     meet it.

_Meeting Troubles Half-way._


     Earth is here so kind, that just tickle her with a hoe and she
     laughs with a harvest.

_A Land of Plenty_ [_Australia_].


     The ugliest of trades have their moments of pleasure. Now, if I
     were a grave-digger, or even a hangman, there are some people I
     could work for with a great deal of enjoyment.

_Ugly Trades._


     A blessed companion is a book,--a book that fitly chosen is a

     Talk to him of Jacob's ladder, and he would ask the number of the
     steps.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON. 1803-1882.

    Nor knowest thou what argument
    Thy life to thy neighbor's creed has lent.
    All are needed by each one;
    Nothing is fair or good alone.

_Each and All._


    I wiped away the weeds and foam,
    I fetched my sea-born treasures home;
    But the poor, unsightly, noisome things
    Had left their beauty on the shore,
    With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.

_Each and All._


    Not from a vain or shallow thought
    His awful Jove young Phidias brought.

_The Problem._


    Out from the heart of Nature rolled
    The burdens of the Bible old.

_The Problem._


    The hand that rounded Peter's dome,
    And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,
    Wrought in a sad sincerity;
    Himself from God he could not free;
    He builded better than he knew:
    The conscious stone to beauty grew.

_The Problem._


    Earth proudly wears the Parthenon
    As the best gem upon her zone.

_The Problem._


    Earth laughs in flowers to see her boastful boys
    Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs;
    Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet
    Clear of the grave.

_Hamatreya._


    Good bye, proud world! I 'm going home;
    Thou art not my friend, and I 'm not thine.[598-1]

_Good Bye._


    For what are they all in their high conceit,

                If eyes were made for seeing,
    Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.

_The Rhodora._


    Things are in the saddle,
      And ride mankind.[599-1]

_Ode, inscribed to W. H. Channing._


    Olympian bards who sung

      And always keep us so.

_Ode to Beauty._


    Heartily know,
    When half-gods go,
    The gods arrive.

_Give all to Love._


    Love not the flower they pluck and know it not,
    And all their botany is Latin names.

_Blight._


    The silent organ loudest chants
      The master's requiem.

_Dirge._


    By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
      Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
    Here once the embattl'd farmers stood,
      And fired the shot heard round the world.[599-2]

_Hymn sung at the Completion of the Battle Monument._


    What potent blood hath modest May!

_May-Day._


    And striving to be man, the worm
      Mounts through all the spires of form.

_May-Day._


    And every man, in love or pride,
    Of his fate is never wide.

_Nemesis._


    None shall rule but the humble,
      And none but Toil shall have.

      Fills his blue urn with fire.

_Ode, Concord, July 4, 1857._

      Nor speak with double tongue.

_Ode, Concord, July 4, 1857._


    So nigh is grandeur to our dust,
      So near is God to man,
    When Duty whispers low, Thou must,
      The youth replies, I can!

_Voluntaries._


    Whoever fights, whoever falls,
      Justice conquers evermore.

_Voluntaries._


    Nor sequent centuries could hit
    Orbit and sum of Shakespeare's wit.

_Solution._


    Born for success he seemed,
    With grace to win, with heart to hold,
    With shining gifts that took all eyes.

_In Memoriam._


    Nor mourn the unalterable Days
    That Genius goes and Folly stays.

_In Memoriam._


    Fear not, then, thou child infirm;
    There 's no god dare wrong a worm.

_Compensation._


    He thought it happier to be dead,
    To die for Beauty, than live for bread.

_Beauty._


    Wilt thou seal up the avenues of ill?
    Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill?

_Suum Cuique._


    Too busy with the crowded hour to fear to live or die.

_Quatrains. Nature._


    Though love repine, and reason chafe,
      There came a voice without reply,--
    "'T is man's perdition to be safe
      When for the truth he ought to die."



_Sacrifice._


    For what avail the plough or sail,
    Or land or life, if freedom fail?

_Boston._


     If the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and
     there abide, the huge world will come round to him.[601-1]

     A man is a bundle of relations, a knot of roots, whose flower and
     fruitage is the world.

     The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its
     aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and
     customs.

_Essays. First Series. Self-Reliance._


     A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines.

_Essays. First Series. Self-Reliance._


     To be great is to be misunderstood.

_Essays. First Series. Self-Reliance._


     Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will.

     of the intuitions.

     it proceeds.

_Essays. First Series. Spiritual Laws._


     All mankind love a lover.

_Essays. First Series. Love._


    A ruddy drop of manly blood
      The surging sea outweighs;
    The world uncertain comes and goes,
      The lover rooted stays.

_Essays. First Series. Epigraph to Friendship._


     A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature.

_Essays. First Series. Friendship._


     Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.

_Essays. First Series. Circles._


     There is nothing settled in manners, but the laws of behaviour
     yield to the energy of the individual.

_Essays. Second Series. Manners._


     And with Cæsar to take in his hand the army, the empire, and
     Cleopatra, and say, "All these will I relinquish if you will show
     me the fountain of the Nile."

_New England Reformers._


     He is great who is what he is from Nature, and who never reminds
     us of others.

_Representative Men. Uses of Great Men._


     Is not marriage an open question, when it is alleged, from the
     beginning of the world, that such as are in the institution wish
     to get out, and such as are out wish to get in?[602-1]

_Representative Men. Montaigne._


     Thought is the property of him who can entertain it, and of him
     who can adequately place it.

     in heaven or earth.

_The Conduct of Life. Society and Solitude._


     Hitch your wagon to a star.

_The Conduct of Life. Civilization._


     I rarely read any Latin, Greek, German, Italian, sometimes not a
     French book, in the original, which I can procure in a good
     version. I like to be beholden to the great metropolitan English
     speech, the sea which receives tributaries from every region
     under heaven. I should as soon think of swimming across Charles
     River when I wish to go to Boston, as of reading all my books in
     originals when I have them rendered for me in my mother tongue.

_The Conduct of Life. Books._


     We do not count a man's years until he has nothing else to count.

     When Shakespeare is charged with debts to his authors, Landor
     replies, "Yet he was more original than his originals. He

_Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality._


     In fact, it is as difficult to appropriate the thoughts of others
     as it is to invent.

_Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality._


     The passages of Shakespeare that we most prize were never quoted
     until within this century.

_Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality._


     Great men are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any
     material force; that thoughts rule the world.

_Progress of Culture. Phi Beta Kappa Address, July 18, 1867._


     I do not find that the age or country makes the least difference;
     no, nor the language the actors spoke, nor the religion which
     they professed, whether Arab in the desert or Frenchman in the
     Academy. I see that sensible men and conscientious men all over
     the world were of one religion.[604-2]

    Time's iron feet can print no ruin-trace.[610-3]

_The Omnipresence of the Deity. Part i._


    The soul aspiring pants its source to mount,
    As streams meander level with their fount.[610-4]

_The Omnipresence of the Deity. Part i._


    The solitary monk who shook the world
    From pagan slumber, when the gospel trump
    Thunder'd its challenge from his dauntless lips
    In peals of truth.

_Luther. Man's Need and God's Supply._


    And not from Nature up to Nature's God,[610-5]
    But down from Nature's God look Nature through.

_Luther. A Landscape of Domestic Life._

[610-4] We take this to be, on the whole, the worst similitude in
    the world. In the first place, no stream meanders or can possibly
    meander level with the fount. In the next place, if streams did
    meander level with their founts, no two motions can be less like
    each other than that of meandering level and that of mounting
    upwards.--MACAULAY: _Review of Montgomery's Poems_ (_Eleventh
    Edition_). _Edinburgh Review, April, 1830._

    These lines were omitted in the subsequent edition of the poem.

CHARLES JEFFERYS. 1807-1865.

    Come o'er the moonlit sea,
    The waves are brightly glowing.

_The Moonlit Sea._


    The morn was fair, the skies were clear,
    No breath came o'er the sea.

_The Rose of Allandale._


    Meek and lowly, pure and holy,
    Chief among the "blessed three."

_Charity._


    Come, wander with me, for the moonbeams are bright
    On river and forest, o'er mountain and lea.

_Come, wander with me._


    A word in season spoken
    May calm the troubled breast.

_A Word in Season._


    The bud is on the bough again,
      The leaf is on the tree.

_The Meeting of Spring and Summer._


    I have heard the mavis singing
      Its love-song to the morn;
    I 've seen the dew-drop clinging
      To the rose just newly born.

_Mary of Argyle._


    We have lived and loved together
      Through many changing years;
    We have shared each other's gladness,
      And wept each other's tears.

_We have lived and loved together._





LADY DUFFERIN. 1807-1867.

    I 'm sitting on the stile, Mary,
      Where we sat side by side.

_Lament of the Irish Emigrant._


    I 'm very lonely now, Mary,
      For the poor make no new friends;
    But oh they love the better still
      The few our Father sends!



_Lament of the Irish Emigrant._





HENRY W. LONGFELLOW. 1807-1882.

(_From the edition of 1886._)

    Look, then, into thine heart, and write![612-1]

_Voices of the Night. Prelude._


    Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
      "Life is but an empty dream!"
    For the soul is dead that slumbers,
      And things are not what they seem.[612-2]

_A Psalm of Life._


    Life is real! life is earnest!
      And the grave is not its goal;
    Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
      Was not spoken of the soul.

_A Psalm of Life._


    Art is long, and time is fleeting,[612-3]
      And our hearts, though stout and brave,
    Still like muffled drums are beating
      Funeral marches to the grave.[612-4]

_A Psalm of Life._


    Trust no future, howe'er pleasant!
      Let the dead Past bury its dead!
    Act, act in the living present!
      Heart within, and God o'erhead!

_A Psalm of Life._


    Lives of great men all remind us
      We can make our lives sublime,
    And departing, leave behind us
      Footprints on the sands of time.

_A Psalm of Life._


    Let us, then, be up and doing,
      With a heart for any fate;[612-5]
    Still achieving, still pursuing,
      Learn to labour and to wait.

_A Psalm of Life._


    There is a reaper whose name is Death,[613-1]
      And with his sickle keen
    He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
      And the flowers that grow between.

_The Reaper and the Flowers._


    The star of the unconquered will.

_The Light of Stars._


    Oh, fear not in a world like this,
      And thou shalt know erelong,--
    Know how sublime a thing it is
      To suffer and be strong.

_The Light of Stars._


    Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
      One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
    When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
      Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.

_Flowers._


    The hooded clouds, like friars,
      Tell their beads in drops of rain.

_Midnight Mass._


                         No tears
    Dim the sweet look that Nature wears.

_Sunrise on the Hills._


    No one is so accursed by fate,
    No one so utterly desolate,
      But some heart, though unknown,
      Responds unto his own.

_Endymion._


    For Time will teach thee soon the truth,
      There are no birds in last year's nest![613-2]

_It is not always May._


    Into each life some rain must fall,
      Some days must be dark and dreary.

_The Rainy Day._


    The prayer of Ajax was for light.[614-1]

_The Goblet of Life._


    O suffering, sad humanity!
    O ye afflicted ones, who lie
    Steeped to the lips in misery,
    Longing, yet afraid to die,
      Patient, though sorely tried!

_The Goblet of Life._


    Standing with reluctant feet
    Where the brook and river meet,
    Womanhood and childhood fleet!

_Maidenhood._


    O thou child of many prayers!
    Life hath quicksands; life hath snares!

_Maidenhood._


    She floats upon the river of his thoughts.[614-2]

_The Spanish Student. Act ii. Sc. 3._


    A banner with the strange device.

_Excelsior._


    This is the place. Stand still, my steed,--
      Let me review the scene,
    And summon from the shadowy past
      The forms that once have been.

_A Gleam of Sunshine._


    The day is done, and the darkness
      Falls from the wings of Night,
    As a feather is wafted downward
      From an eagle in his flight.

_The Day is done._


    A feeling of sadness and longing
      That is not akin to pain,
    And resembles sorrow only
      As the mist resembles the rain.

_The Day is done._


    And the night shall be filled with music,
      And the cares that infest the day
    Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
      And as silently steal away.

_The Day is done._


            Sail on, O Ship of State!
    Sail on, O Union, strong and great!
    Humanity with all its fears,
    With all the hopes of future years,
    Is hanging breathless on thy fate!

_The Building of the Ship._


    Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,--
    Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
    Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,
    Are all with thee,--are all with thee!

_The Building of the Ship._


    The leaves of memory seemed to make
      A mournful rustling in the dark.

_The Fire of Drift-wood._


    There is no flock, however watched and tended,
      But one dead lamb is there;
    There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,
      But has one vacant chair.

_Resignation._


    The air is full of farewells to the dying,
      And mournings for the dead.

_Resignation._


    But oftentimes celestial benedictions
      Assume this dark disguise.

_Resignation._


    What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers
      May be heaven's distant lamps.

_Resignation._


    There is no death! What seems so is transition;
      This life of mortal breath
    Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
      Whose portal we call Death.

_Resignation._


    Safe from temptation, safe from sin's pollution,
      She lives whom we call dead.

_Resignation._


    In the elder days of Art,
      Builders wrought with greatest care
    Each minute and unseen part;
      For the gods see everywhere.

_The Builders._


    This is the forest primeval.



_Evangeline. Part i._


    When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.

_Evangeline. Part i. 1._


    Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.

_Evangeline. Part i. 3._


    And as she looked around, she saw how Death the consoler,
    Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.

_Evangeline. Part ii. 5._


    God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting.[616-1]

_The Courtship of Miles Standish. iv._


    Into a world unknown,--the corner-stone of a nation![616-2]

_The Courtship of Miles Standish. iv._


    Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
      That of our vices we can frame
    A ladder, if we will but tread
      Beneath our feet each deed of shame.[616-3]

_The Ladder of Saint Augustine._


    The heights by great men reached and kept
      Were not attained by sudden flight,
    But they while their companions slept
      Were toiling upward in the night.

_The Ladder of Saint Augustine._


    The surest pledge of a deathless name
    Is the silent homage of thoughts unspoken.

_The Herons of Elmwood._


    He has singed the beard of the king of Spain.[616-4]

_The Dutch Picture._


    The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,
    And all the sweet serenity of books.

_Morituri Salutamus._


    With useless endeavour
    Forever, forever,
    Is Sisyphus rolling
    His stone up the mountain!

_The Masque of Pandora. Chorus of the Eumenides._


    All things come round to him who will but wait.[617-1]

_Tales of a Wayside Inn. The Student's Tale._


         Time has laid his hand
    Upon my heart gently, not smiting it,
    But as a harper lays his open palm
    Upon his harp, to deaden its vibrations.

_The Golden Legend. iv._


    Hospitality sitting with Gladness.

_Translation from Frithiof's Saga._


    Who ne'er his bread in sorrow ate,
      Who ne'er the mournful midnight hours
    Weeping upon his bed has sate,
      He knows you not, ye Heavenly Powers.

_Motto, Hyperion. Book i._[617-2]


    Something the heart must have to cherish,
      Must love and joy and sorrow learn;
    Something with passion clasp, or perish
      And in itself to ashes burn.

_Hyperion. Book ii._


     Alas! it is not till time, with reckless hand, has torn out half
     the leaves from the Book of Human Life to light the fires of
     passion with from day to day, that man begins to see that the
     leaves which remain are few in number.

_Hyperion. Book iv. Chap. viii._


     Hold the fleet angel fast until he bless thee.[618-1]

_Kavanagh._


                 There is no greater sorrow
    Than to be mindful of the happy time
    In misery.[618-2]

_Inferno. Canto v. Line 121._

    And take for a worthier stage the soul itself,
    Its shifting fancies and celestial lights,
    With all its grand orchestral silences
    To keep the pauses of its rhythmic sounds.

    Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,--

_To J. S._


    Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace!
      Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,
    While the stars burn, the moons increase,
      And the great ages onward roll.

_To J. S._

      Nothing comes to thee new or strange.
    Sleep full of rest from head to feet;
      Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.

_To J. S._

    Be each man's rule, and universal peace
    Lie like a shaft of light across the land,
    And like a lane of beams athwart the sea,
    Thro' all the circle of the golden year?

_The Golden Year._


    I am a part of all that I have met.[625-1]

_Ulysses._


    How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
    To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use,--
    As tho' to breathe were life!

_Ulysses._


    It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
    And see the great Achilles whom we knew.

_Ulysses._


    Here at the quiet limit of the world.

_Tithonus._


    In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
    In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.

_Locksley Hall. Line 19._


    Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
    Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.

_Locksley Hall. Line 33._


    He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,
    Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.

_Locksley Hall. Line 49._


                 This is truth the poet sings,
    That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.[626-1]

_Locksley Hall. Line 75._


    Like a dog, he hunts in dreams.

_Locksley Hall. Line 79._


    With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.

_Locksley Hall. Line 94._


    But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels.

_Locksley Hall. Line 105._


    Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new.

_Locksley Hall. Line 117._


    Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,
    And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.

_Locksley Hall. Line 137._


    Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.

_Locksley Hall. Line 141._


    I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.

_Locksley Hall. Line 168._


    I, the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time.

_Locksley Hall. Line 178._


    Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change.

_Locksley Hall. Line 182._


    Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.

_Locksley Hall. Line 184._


    I waited for the train at Coventry;
    I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge,
    To watch the three tall spires; and there I shaped
    The city's ancient legend into this.

_Godiva._


    And on her lover's arm she leant,
      And round her waist she felt it fold,
    And far across the hills they went
      In that new world which is the old.

_The Day-Dream. The Departure, i._


    And o'er the hills, and far away
      Beyond their utmost purple rim,
    Beyond the night, across the day,
      Thro' all the world she follow'd him.

_The Day-Dream. The Departure, iv._


    We are ancients of the earth,
    And in the morning of the times.

_L'Envoi._


    As she fled fast through sun and shade
    The happy winds upon her play'd,
    Blowing the ringlet from the braid.

_Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere._


    For now the poet cannot die,
      Nor leave his music as of old,
      But round him ere he scarce be cold
    Begins the scandal and the cry.

_To ----, after reading a Life and Letters._


    But oh for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
      And the sound of a voice that is still!

_Break, break, break._


    But the tender grace of a day that is dead
      Will never come back to me.

_Break, break, break._


    For men may come and men may go,
      But I go on forever.

_The Brook._


    Mastering the lawless science of our law,--
    That codeless myriad of precedent,
    That wilderness of single instances.

_Aylmer's Field._


    Rich in saving common-sense,
    And, as the greatest only are,
    In his simplicity sublime.

_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 4._


    Oh good gray head which all men knew!



_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 4._


                    That tower of strength
    Which stood four-square to all the winds that blew.

_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 4._


    For this is England's greatest son,
    He that gain'd a hundred fights,
    And never lost an English gun.

_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 6._


    Not once or twice in our rough-island story
    The path of duty was the way to glory.

_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 8._


    All in the valley of death
      Rode the six hundred.

_The Charge of the Light Brigade. Stanza 1._


      Some one had blunder'd:
    Theirs not to make reply,
    Theirs not to reason why,
    Theirs but to do and die.

_The Charge of the Light Brigade. Stanza 2._


    Cannon to right of them,
    Cannon to left of them,
    Cannon in front of them.
         .     .     .     .
    Into the jaws of death,[628-1]
    Into the mouth of hell
      Rode the six hundred.

_The Charge of the Light Brigade. Stanza 3._


    That a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies;
    That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought with outright;
    But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight.

_The Grandmother. Stanza 8._


    O Love! what hours were thine and mine,
    In lands of palm and southern pine;
      In lands of palm, of orange-blossom,
    Of olive, aloe, and maize and vine!

_The Daisy. Stanza 1._


    So dear a life your arms enfold,
    Whose crying is a cry for gold.

_The Daisy. Stanza 24._


    Read my little fable:
      He that runs may read.[629-1]
    Most can raise the flowers now,
      For all have got the seed.

_The Flower._


    In that fierce light which beats upon a throne.

_Idylls of the King. Dedication._


    It is the little rift within the lute
    That by and by will make the music mute,
    And ever widening slowly silence all.

_Idylls of the King. Merlin and Vivien._


    His honour rooted in dishonour stood,
    And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.

_Idylls of the King. Launcelot and Elaine._


    The old order changeth, yielding place to new;
    And God fulfils himself in many ways,
    Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.

_The Passing of Arthur._


                   I am going a long way
    With these thou seëst--if indeed I go
    (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--
    To the island-valley of Avilion,
    Where falls not hail or rain or any snow,
    Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
    Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns
    And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,
    Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.

_The Passing of Arthur._


    With prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,
    And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.

_The Princess. Prologue. Line 141._


    A rosebud set with little wilful thorns,
    And sweet as English air could make her, she.

_The Princess. Part i. Line 153._


                        Jewels five-words-long,
    That on the stretch'd forefinger of all Time
    Sparkle forever.

_The Princess. Part ii. Line 355._


    Blow, bugle, blow! set the wild echoes flying!
    Blow, bugle! answer, echoes! dying, dying, dying.

_The Princess. Part iii. Line 352._


          O Love! they die in yon rich sky,
            They faint on hill or field or river:
          Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
            And grow forever and forever.
    Blow, bugle, blow! set the wild echoes flying!
    And answer, echoes, answer! dying, dying, dying.

_The Princess. Part iii. Line 360._


    There sinks the nebulous star we call the sun.

_The Princess. Part iv. Line 1._


      Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean.
    Tears from the depth of some divine despair
    Rise in the heart and gather to the eyes,
    In looking on the happy autumn-fields,
    And thinking of the days that are no more.

_The Princess. Part iv. Line 21._


                Unto dying eyes
    The casement slowly grows a glimmering square.

_The Princess. Part iv. Line 33._


      Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
    And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
    On lips that are for others; deep as love,--
    Deep as first love, and wild with all regret.
    Oh death in life, the days that are no more!

_The Princess. Part iv. Line 36._


                 Sweet is every sound,
    Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;
    Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro' the lawn,
    The moan of doves in immemorial elms,
    And murmuring of innumerable bees.

_The Princess. Part vii. Line 203._


                      Happy he
    With such a mother! faith in womankind
    Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high
    Comes easy to him; and tho' he trip and fall,
    He shall not blind his soul with clay.



_The Princess. Part vii. Line 308._


    Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null.

_Maud. Part i. ii._


    That jewell'd mass of millinery,
    That oil'd and curl'd Assyrian Bull.

_Maud. Part i. vi. Stanza 6._


    Gorgonized me from head to foot,
      With a stony British stare.

_Maud. Part i. xiii. Stanza 2._


    Come into the garden, Maud,
      For the black bat, night, has flown;
    Come into the garden, Maud,
      I am here at the gate alone.

_Maud. Part i. xxii. Stanza 1._


    Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls.

_Maud. Part i. xxii. Stanza 9._


    Ah, Christ, that it were possible
      For one short hour to see
    The souls we loved, that they might tell us
      What and where they be.

_Maud. Part ii. iv. Stanza 3._


    Let knowledge grow from more to more.

_In Memoriam. Prologue. Line 25._


    I held it truth, with him who sings[631-1]
      To one clear harp in divers tones,
      That men may rise on stepping-stones
    Of their dead selves to higher things.[631-2]

_In Memoriam. i. Stanza 1._


    But for the unquiet heart and brain
      A use in measured language lies;
      The sad mechanic exercise
    Like dull narcotics numbing pain.

_In Memoriam. v. Stanza 2._


                 Never morning wore
    To evening, but some heart did break.

_In Memoriam. vi. Stanza 2._


      And topples round the dreary west
    A looming bastion fringed with fire.

_In Memoriam. xv. Stanza 5._


      And from his ashes may be made
    The violet of his native land.[632-1]

_In Memoriam. xviii. Stanza 1._


      I do but sing because I must,
    And pipe but as the linnets sing.[632-2]

_In Memoriam. xxi. Stanza 6._


    The shadow cloak'd from head to foot.

_In Memoriam. xxiii. Stanza 1._


    Who keeps the keys of all the creeds.

_In Memoriam. xxiii. Stanza 2._


      And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
    Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech.

_In Memoriam. xxiii. Stanza 4._


      'T is better to have loved and lost
    Than never to have loved at all.[632-3]

_In Memoriam. xxvii. Stanza 4._


    Her eyes are homes of silent prayer.

_In Memoriam. xxxii. Stanza 1._


      Whose faith has centre everywhere,
    Nor cares to fix itself to form.

_In Memoriam. xxxiii. Stanza 1._


      Short swallow-flights of song, that dip
    Their wings in tears, and skim away.

_In Memoriam. xlviii. Stanza 4._


    Hold thou the good; define it well;
      For fear divine Philosophy
      Should push beyond her mark, and be
    Procuress to the Lords of Hell.

_In Memoriam. liii. Stanza 4._


    Oh yet we trust that somehow good
      Will be the final goal of ill.

_In Memoriam. liv. Stanza 1._


                 But what am I?
      An infant crying in the night:
      An infant crying for the light,
    And with no language but a cry.

_In Memoriam. liv. Stanza 5._


      So careful of the type she seems,
    So careless of the single life.

_In Memoriam. lv. Stanza 2._


               The great world's altar-stairs,
    That slope through darkness up to God.

_In Memoriam. lv. Stanza 4._


    Who battled for the True, the Just.

_In Memoriam. lvi. Stanza 5._


    And grasps the skirts of happy chance,
    And breasts the blows of circumstance.

_In Memoriam. lxiv. Stanza 2._


      And lives to clutch the golden keys,
      To mould a mighty state's decrees,
    And shape the whisper of the throne.

_In Memoriam. lxiv. Stanza 3._


    So many worlds, so much to do,
      So little done, such things to be.

_In Memoriam. lxxiii. Stanza 1._


    Thy leaf has perish'd in the green,
      And while we breathe beneath the sun,
      The world, which credits what is done,
    Is cold to all that might have been.

_In Memoriam. lxxv. Stanza 4._


    O last regret, regret can die!

_In Memoriam. lxxviii. Stanza 5._


      There lives more faith in honest doubt,
    Believe me, than in half the creeds.

_In Memoriam. xcvi. Stanza 3._


    He seems so near, and yet so far.

_In Memoriam. xcvii. Stanza 6._


    Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky!

_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 1._


    Ring out the old, ring in the new,
    Ring, happy bells, across the snow!

_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 2._


      Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
    But ring the fuller minstrel in!

_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 5._


    Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
      Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
      Ring out the thousand wars of old,
    Ring in the thousand years of peace!

_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 7._


    Ring in the valiant man and free,
      The larger heart, the kindlier hand!
      Ring out the darkness of the land,
    Ring in the Christ that is to be!

_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 8._


    And thus he bore without abuse
      The grand old name of gentleman,
      Defamed by every charlatan,
    And soil'd with all ignoble use.



_In Memoriam. cxi. Stanza 6._


              Some novel power
      Sprang up forever at a touch,
      And hope could never hope too much
    In watching thee from hour to hour.

_In Memoriam. cxii. Stanza 3._


    Large elements in order brought,
      And tracts of calm from tempest made,
      And world-wide fluctuation sway'd,
    In vassal tides that follow'd thought.

_In Memoriam. cxii. Stanza 4._


           Wearing all that weight
    Of learning lightly like a flower.

_In Memoriam. Conclusion. Stanza 10._


      One God, one law, one element,
      And one far-off divine event
    To which the whole creation moves.

_In Memoriam. Conclusion. Stanza 36._

    But on and up, where Nature's heart
      Beats strong amid the hills.

_Tragedy of the Lac de Gaube. Stanza 2._


    Great thoughts, great feelings came to them,
      Like instincts, unawares.

_The Men of Old._


    A man's best things are nearest him,
      Lie close about his feet.

_The Men of Old._


    I wandered by the brookside,
      I wandered by the mill;
    I could not hear the brook flow,
      The noisy wheel was still.

_The Brookside._


    The beating of my own heart
      Was all the sound I heard.



_The Brookside._





OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 1809- ----.

    Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
      Long has it waved on high,
    And many an eye has danced to see
      That banner in the sky.

_Old Ironsides._


    Nail to the mast her holy flag,
      Set every threadbare sail,
    And give her to the god of storms,
      The lightning and the gale!

_Old Ironsides._


    Like sentinel and nun, they keep
      Their vigil on the green.

_The Cambridge Churchyard._


    The mossy marbles rest
    On the lips that he has prest
        In their bloom;
    And the names he loved to hear
    Have been carved for many a year
        On the tomb.

_The Last Leaf._


    I know it is a sin
    For me to sit and grin
        At him here;
    But the old three-cornered hat,
    And the breeches, and all that,
        Are so queer!

_The Last Leaf._


    Thou say'st an undisputed thing
      In such a solemn way.

_To an Insect._


    Their discords sting through Burns and Moore,
      Like hedgehogs dressed in lace.

_The Music-Grinders._


    You think they are crusaders sent
      From some infernal clime,
    To pluck the eyes of sentiment
      And dock the tail of Rhyme,
    To crack the voice of Melody
      And break the legs of Time.



_The Music-Grinders._


    And since, I never dare to write
      As funny as I can.

_The Height of the Ridiculous._


    When the last reader reads no more.

_The Last Reader._


    The freeman casting with unpurchased hand
    The vote that shakes the turrets of the land.

_Poetry, a Metrical Essay._


    'T is the heart's current lends the cup its glow,
    Whate'er the fountain whence the draught may flow.

_A Sentiment._


    Yes, child of suffering, thou mayst well be sure
    He who ordained the Sabbath loves the poor!

_A Rhymed Lesson. Urania._


    And when you stick on conversation's burrs,
    Don't strew your pathway with those dreadful _urs_.

_A Rhymed Lesson. Urania._


    Thine eye was on the censer,
      And not the hand that bore it.

_Lines by a Clerk._


    Where go the poet's lines?
      Answer, ye evening tapers!
    Ye auburn locks, ye golden curls,
      Speak from your folded papers!

_The Poet's Lot._


    A few can touch the magic string,
      And noisy Fame is proud to win them;
    Alas for those that never sing,
      But die with all their music in them!

_The Voiceless._


    O hearts that break and give no sign
      Save whitening lip and fading tresses!

_The Voiceless._


    Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
    As the swift seasons roll!
    Leave thy low-vaulted past!
    Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
    Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
    Till thou at length art free,
    Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!



_The Chambered Nautilus._


    His home! the Western giant smiles,
      And twirls the spotty globe to find it;
    This little speck, the British Isles?
      'T is but a freckle,--never mind it.

_A Good Time going._


    But Memory blushes at the sneer,
      And Honor turns with frown defiant,
    And Freedom, leaning on her spear,
      Laughs louder than the laughing giant.

_A Good Time going._


    You hear that boy laughing?--you think he 's all fun;
    But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done;
    The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,
    And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all.

_The Boys._


    Good to the heels the well-worn slipper feels
      When the tired player shuffles off the buskin;
    A page of Hood may do a fellow good
      After a scolding from Carlyle or Ruskin.

_How not to settle it._


     A thought is often original, though you have uttered it a hundred
     times.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. i._


     People that make puns are like wanton boys that put coppers on
     the railroad tracks.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. i._


     Everybody likes and respects self-made men. It is a great deal
     better to be made in that way than not to be made at all.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. i._


     Sin has many tools, but a lie is the handle which fits them all.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._


     There is that glorious epicurean paradox uttered by my friend the
     historian,[637-1] in one of his flashing moments: "Give us the
     luxuries of life, and we will dispense with its necessaries." To
     this must certainly be added that other saying of one of the
     wittiest of men:[638-1] "Good Americans when they die go to
     Paris."

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._


     Boston State-house is the hub of the solar system. You could n't
     pry that out of a Boston man if you had the tire of all creation
     straightened out for a crow-bar.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._


     The axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of
     each and every town or city.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._


     The world's great men have not commonly been great scholars, nor
     its great scholars great men.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._


     Knowledge and timber should n't be much used till they are
     seasoned.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._


     The hat is the _ultimum moriens_ of respectability.

_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. viii._


     To be seventy years young is sometimes far more cheerful and
     hopeful than to be forty years old.

     all our hearts, to be defended by all our hands.

     States in which they live, the safety of the whole Republic, the
     dignity of the elective franchise,--all alike demand that the
     still remaining bonds of ignorance shall be unloosed and broken,
     and the minds as well as the bodies of the emancipated go free.

_Yorktown Oration in 1881._





JAMES ALDRICH. 1810-1856.

    Her suffering ended with the day,
      Yet lived she at its close,
    And breathed the long, long night away
      In statue-like repose.

_A Death-Bed._


    But when the sun in all his state
      Illumed the eastern skies,
    She passed through Glory's morning-gate,
      And walked in Paradise.

_A Death-Bed._





THEODORE PARKER. 1810-1860.

     There is what I call the American idea. . . . This idea demands,
     as the proximate organization thereof, a democracy,--that is, a
     government of all the people, by all the people, for all the
     people; of course, a government of the principles of eternal
     justice, the unchanging law of God. For shortness' sake I will
     call it the idea of Freedom.[639-1]

EDMUND H. SEARS. 1810-1876.

    Calm on the listening ear of night
      Come Heaven's melodious strains,
    Where wild Judea stretches far
      Her silver-mantled plains.

_Christmas Song._


    It came upon the midnight clear,
      That glorious song of old.

EDGAR A. POE. 1811-1849.

    Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,--
      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

_The Raven._


                  Whom unmerciful disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster.

_The Raven._


    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

_The Raven._


    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
      Shall be lifted--Nevermore!

    And the grandeur that was Rome.

FRANCES ANNE KEMBLE. 1811- ----.

    A sacred burden is this life ye bear:
    Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly,
    Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly.
    Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin,
    But onward, upward, till the goal ye win.

_Lines addressed to the Young Gentlemen leaving the Lenox Academy, Mass._


    Better trust all, and be deceived,
      And weep that trust and that deceiving,
    Than doubt one heart, that if believed
      Had blessed one's life with true believing.

_Faith._





BARTHOLOMEW DOWLING.

    Ho! stand to your glasses steady!
      'T is all we have left to prize.
    A cup to the dead already,--
      Hurrah for the next that dies![641-1]

_Revelry in India._


FOOTNOTES:

[641-1] This quatrain appears with variations in several stanzas.
    "The poem," says Mr. Rossiter Johnson in "Famous Single and
    Fugitive Poems," "is persistently attributed to Alfred Domett; but
    in a letter to me, Feb. 6, 1879, he says: 'I did not write that
    poem, and was never in India in my life. I am as ignorant of the
    authorship as you can be.'"




ALFRED DOMETT. 1811- ----.

    It was the calm and silent night!
      Seven hundred years and fifty-three
    Had Rome been growing up to might,
      And now was queen of land and sea.
    No sound was heard of clashing wars,
      Peace brooded o'er the hushed domain;
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars
      Held undisturbed their ancient reign
          In the solemn midnight,
              Centuries ago.

_Christmas Hymn._





JULIA A. FLETCHER (NOW MRS. CARNEY).

    Little drops of water, little grains of sand,
    Make the mighty ocean and the pleasant land.
    So the little minutes, humble though they be,
    Make the mighty ages of eternity.

_Little Things, 1845._


    Little deeds of kindness, little words of love,
    Help to make earth happy like the heaven above.

_Little Things, 1845._





AUSTEN H. LAYARD. ---- -1894.

     I have always believed that success would be the inevitable
     result if the two services, the army and the navy, had fair play,

ROBERT BROWNING. 1812-1890.

                        Any nose
    May ravage with impunity a rose.

_Sordello. Book vi._


    That we devote ourselves to God, is seen
    In living just as though no God there were.

_Paracelsus. Part i._


                              Be sure that God
    Ne'er dooms to waste the strength he deigns impart.

_Paracelsus. Part i._


    I see my way as birds their trackless way.
    I shall arrive,--what time, what circuit first,
    I ask not; but unless God send his hail
    Or blinding fire-balls, sleet or stifling snow,
    In some time, his good time, I shall arrive:
    He guides me and the bird. In his good time.

_Paracelsus. Part i._


                 Are there not, dear Michal,
    Two points in the adventure of the diver,--
    One, when a beggar he prepares to plunge;
    One, when a prince he rises with his pearl?
    Festus, I plunge.

_Paracelsus. Part i._


                     God is the perfect poet,
    Who in his person acts his own creations.

_Paracelsus. Part ii._


    The sad rhyme of the men who proudly clung
    To their first fault, and withered in their pride.

_Paracelsus. Part iv._


    I give the fight up: let there be an end,
    A privacy, an obscure nook for me.
    I want to be forgotten even by God.

_Paracelsus. Part v._


                              Progress is
    The law of life: man is not Man as yet.

_Paracelsus. Part v._


    Say not "a small event!" Why "small"?
    Costs it more pain that this ye call
    A "great event" should come to pass
    From that? Untwine me from the mass
    Of deeds which make up life, one deed
    Power shall fall short in or exceed!

_Pippa Passes. Introduction._


    God 's in his heaven:
    All 's right with the world.

_Pippa Passes. Part i._


    Some unsuspected isle in the far seas,--
    Some unsuspected isle in far-off seas.

_Pippa Passes. Part ii._


    In the morning of the world,
    When earth was nigher heaven than now.

_Pippa Passes. Part iii._


    All service ranks the same with God,--
    With God, whose puppets, best and worst,
    Are we: there is no last nor first.

_Pippa Passes. Part iv._


    I trust in Nature for the stable laws
    Of beauty and utility. Spring shall plant
    And Autumn garner to the end of time.
    I trust in God,--the right shall be the right
    And other than the wrong, while he endures.
    I trust in my own soul, that can perceive
    The outward and the inward,--Nature's good
    And God's.

_A Soul's Tragedy. Act i._


     Ever judge of men by their professions. For though the bright
     moment of promising is but a moment, and cannot be prolonged, yet
     if sincere in its moment's extravagant goodness, why, trust it,
     and know the man by it, I say,--not by his performance; which is
     half the world's work, interfere as the world needs must with its
     accidents and circumstances: the profession was purely the man's
     own. I judge people by what they might be,--not are, nor will be.

_A Soul's Tragedy. Act ii._


    There 's a woman like a dewdrop, she 's so purer than the purest.



_A Blot in the 'Scutcheon. Act i. Sc. iii._


    When is man strong until he feels alone?

_Colombe's Birthday. Act iii._


      When the fight begins within himself,
    A man 's worth something.

_Men and Women. Bishop Blougram's Apology._


                        The sprinkled isles,
    Lily on lily, that o'erlace the sea.

_Cleon._


    And I have written three books on the soul,
    Proving absurd all written hitherto,
    And putting us to ignorance again.

_Cleon._


    Sappho survives, because we sing her songs;
    And Æschylus, because we read his plays!

_Cleon._


    Rafael made a century of sonnets.

_One Word More. ii._


    Other heights in other lives, God willing.

_One Word More. xii._


    God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures
    Boasts two soul-sides,--one to face the world with,
    One to show a woman when he loves her!

_One Word More. xvii._


    Oh their Rafael of the dear Madonnas,
    Oh their Dante of the dread Inferno,
    Wrote one song--and in my brain I sing it;
    Drew one angel--borne, see, on my bosom!

_One Word More. xix._


                       The lie was dead
    And damned, and truth stood up instead.

_Count Gismond. xiii._


    Over my head his arm he flung
    Against the world.

_Count Gismond. xix._


      Just my vengeance complete,
      The man sprang to his feet,
    Stood erect, caught at God's skirts, and prayed!
    So, I was afraid!

_Instans Tyrannus. vii._


                   Oh never star
    Was lost here but it rose afar.



_Waring. ii._


    Sing, riding 's a joy! For me I ride.

_The last Ride together. vii._


    When the liquor 's out, why clink the cannikin?

_The Flight of the Duchess. xvi._


    That low man seeks a little thing to do,
        Sees it and does it;
    This high man, with a great thing to pursue,
        Dies ere he knows it.
    That low man goes on adding one to one,--
        His hundred 's soon hit;
    This high man, aiming at a million,
        Misses an unit.
    That has the world here--should he need the next,
        Let the world mind him!
    This throws himself on God, and unperplexed
        Seeking shall find him.

_A Grammarian's Funeral._


    Lofty designs must close in like effects.

_A Grammarian's Funeral._


    I hear you reproach, "But delay was best,
    For their end was a crime." Oh, a crime will do
    As well, I reply, to serve for a test
    As a virtue golden through and through,
    Sufficient to vindicate itself
    And prove its worth at a moment's view!
         .     .     .     .     .     .
    Let a man contend to the uttermost
    For his life's set prize, be it what it will!
    The counter our lovers staked was lost
    As surely as if it were lawful coin;
    And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost
    Is--the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin,
    Though the end in sight was a vice, I say.

_The Statue and the Bust._


    Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.

_Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came. xxxiii._


    Just for a handful of silver he left us,
      Just for a riband to stick in his coat.



_The Lost Leader. i._


    We shall march prospering,--not thro' his presence;
      Songs may inspirit us,--not from his lyre;
    Deeds will be done,--while he boasts his quiescence,
      Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire.

_The Lost Leader. ii._


    They are perfect; how else?--they shall never change:
      We are faulty; why not?--we have time in store.

_Old Pictures in Florence. xvi._


               What 's come to perfection perishes.
    Things learned on earth we shall practise in heaven;
      Works done least rapidly Art most cherishes.

_Old Pictures in Florence. xvii._


    Italy, my Italy!
    Queen Mary's saying serves for me
      (When fortune's malice
      Lost her Calais):
    "Open my heart, and you will see
    Graved inside of it 'Italy.'"

_De Gustibus. ii._


    That 's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,
    Lest you should think he never could recapture
    The first fine careless rapture.

_Home-Thoughts from Abroad. ii._


    God made all the creatures, and gave them our love and our fear,
    To give sign we and they are his children, one family here.

_Saul. vi._


    How good is man's life, the mere living! how fit to employ
    All the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy!

_Saul. ix._


    'T is not what man does which exalts him, but what man would do.

_Saul. xvii._


    O woman-country![647-1] wooed not wed,
      Loved all the more by earth's male-lands,
    Laid to their hearts instead.

_By the Fireside. vi._


                      That great brow
    And the spirit-small hand propping it.

_By the Fireside. xxiii._


    If two lives join, there is oft a scar.
      They are one and one, with a shadowy third;
    One near one is too far.

_By the Fireside. xlvi._


                     Only I discern
    Infinite passion, and the pain
    Of finite hearts that yearn.

_Two in the Campagna. xii._


    Round and round, like a dance of snow
    In a dazzling drift, as its guardians, go
    Floating the women faded for ages,
    Sculptured in stone on the poet's pages.

_Women and Roses._


    How he lies in his rights of a man!
    Death has done all death can.
    And absorbed in the new life he leads,
    He recks not, he heeds
    Nor his wrong nor my vengeance; both strike
    On his senses alike,
    And are lost in the solemn and strange
    Surprise of the change.

_After._


    Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,
      And did he stop and speak to you,
    And did you speak to him again?
      How strange it seems, and new!

_Memorabilia. i._


    He who did well in war just earns the right
    To begin doing well in peace.

_Luria. Act ii._


    And inasmuch as feeling, the East's gift,
    Is quick and transient,--comes, and lo! is gone,
    While Northern thought is slow and durable.

_Luria. Act v._


    A people is but the attempt of many
    To rise to the completer life of one;
    And those who live as models for the mass
    Are singly of more value than they all.



_Luria. Act v._


               I count life just a stuff
    To try the soul's strength on.

_In a Balcony._


    Was there nought better than to enjoy?
      No feat which, done, would make time break,
      And let us pent-up creatures through
      Into eternity, our due?
    No forcing earth teach heaven's employ?

_Dîs Aliter Visum; or, Le Byron de nos Jours._


    There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;
      The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;
    What was good shall be good, with for evil so much good more;
      On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.

_Abt Vogler. ix._


             Then welcome each rebuff
             That turns earth's smoothness rough,
    Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand, but go!
             Be our joys three-parts pain!
             Strive, and hold cheap the strain;
    Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!

_Rabbi Ben Ezra._


    What I aspired to be,
    And was not, comforts me.

_Rabbi Ben Ezra._


    Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure.

_Rabbi Ben Ezra._


    For life, with all it yields of joy and woe,
    And hope and fear (believe the aged friend),
    Is just our chance o' the prize of learning love,--
    How love might be, hath been indeed, and is.

_A Death in the Desert._


                             The body sprang
    At once to the height, and stayed; but the soul,--no!

_A Death in the Desert._


    What? Was man made a wheel-work to wind up,
    And be discharged, and straight wound up anew?
    No! grown, his growth lasts; taught, he ne'er forgets:
    May learn a thousand things, not twice the same.



_A Death in the Desert._


    For I say this is death and the sole death,--
    When a man's loss comes to him from his gain,
    Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance,
    And lack of love from love made manifest.

_A Death in the Desert._


    Progress, man's distinctive mark alone,
    Not God's, and not the beasts: God is, they are;
    Man partly is, and wholly hopes to be.

_A Death in the Desert._


                          The ultimate, angels' law,
    Indulging every instinct of the soul
    There where law, life, joy, impulse are one thing!

_A Death in the Desert._


    How sad and bad and mad it was!
      But then, how it was sweet!

_Confessions. ix._


    So may a glory from defect arise.

_Deaf and Dumb._


    This could but have happened once,--
      And we missed it, lost it forever.

_Youth and Art. xvii._


    Fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat,
                The mist in my face.
          .      .      .      .      .      .      .
    No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers,
                The heroes of old;
    Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears
                Of pain, darkness, and cold.

_Prospice._


    It 's wiser being good than bad;
      It 's safer being meek than fierce;
    It 's fitter being sane than mad.
      My own hope is, a sun will pierce
    The thickest cloud earth ever stretched;
      That after Last returns the First,
    Though a wide compass round be fetched;
      That what began best can't end worst,
      Nor what God blessed once prove accurst.

_Apparent Failure. vii._


    In the great right of an excessive wrong.



_The Ring and the Book. The other Half-Rome. Line 1055._


                   Was never evening yet
    But seemed far beautifuller than its day.

_The Ring and the Book. Pompilia. Line 357._


                  The curious crime, the fine
    Felicity and flower of wickedness.

_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 590._


                 Of what I call God,
    And fools call Nature.

_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 1073._


    Why comes temptation, but for man to meet
    And master and make crouch beneath his foot,
    And so be pedestaled in triumph?

_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 1185._


    White shall not neutralize the black, nor good
    Compensate bad in man, absolve him so:
    Life's business being just the terrible choice.

_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 1236._


          It is the glory and good of Art
    That Art remains the one way possible
    Of speaking truth,--to mouths like mine, at least.

_The Book and the Ring. The Pope. Line 842._


    Thy[651-1] rare gold ring of verse (the poet praised)
    Linking our England to his Italy.

_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 873._


    But how carve way i' the life that lies before,
    If bent on groaning ever for the past?

_Balaustion's Adventure._


    Better have failed in the high aim, as I,
    Than vulgarly in the low aim succeed,--
    As, God be thanked! I do not.

_The Inn Album. iv._


    Have you found your life distasteful?
      My life did, and does, smack sweet.
    Was your youth of pleasure wasteful?
      Mine I saved and hold complete.
    Do your joys with age diminish?
      When mine fail me, I 'll complain.
    Must in death your daylight finish?
      My sun sets to rise again.

_At the "Mermaid." Stanza 10._


                     "With this same key
    Shakespeare unlocked his heart"[652-1] once more!
    Did Shakespeare? If so, the less Shakespeare he!

_House. x._


    God's justice, tardy though it prove perchance,
    Rests never on the track until it reach
    Delinquency.[652-2]

_Cenciaja._

ELLEN STURGIS HOOPER. 1816-1841.

    I slept, and dreamed that life was Beauty;
    I woke, and found that life was Duty.
    Was thy dream then a shadowy lie?
    Toil on, poor heart, unceasingly;
    And thou shalt find thy dream to be
    A truth and noonday light to thee.

_Life a Duty._





PHILIP JAMES BAILEY. 1816- ----.

    We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;
    In feelings, not in figures on a dial.
    We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives
    Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.
    Life 's but a means unto an end; that end
    Beginning, mean, and end to all things,--God.

_Necessity for a Promenade Drive._


    For it stirs the blood in an old man's heart,
      And makes his pulses fly,
    To catch the thrill of a happy voice
      And the light of a pleasant eye.

_Saturday Afternoon._


    It is the month of June,
      The month of leaves and roses,
    When pleasant sights salute the eyes,
      And pleasant scents the noses.

_The Month of June._


    Let us weep in our darkness, but weep not for him!
    Not for him who, departing, leaves millions in tears!
    Not for him who has died full of honor and years!
    Not for him who ascended Fame's ladder so high
    From the round at the top he has stepped to the sky.

_The Death of Harrison._

_Columbus._


    Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
    In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;
    Some great cause, God's new Messiah offering each the bloom or blight,
    Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right;
    And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.

_The Present Crisis._


    Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne.

_The Present Crisis._


    Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched crust,
    Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 't is prosperous to be just;
    Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,
    Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified.

_The Present Crisis._

    This child is not mine as the first was;
      I cannot sing it to rest;
    I cannot lift it up fatherly,
      And bless it upon my breast.

    A nature sloping to the southern side;
    I thank her for it, though when clouds arise
    Such natures double-darken gloomy skies.

_To George William Curtis._


    In life's small things be resolute and great

    "I find thee worthy; do this deed for me"?

    On a lone barren isle, where the wild roaring billows
      Assail the stern rock, and the loud tempests rave,
    The hero lies still, while the dew-drooping willows,
      Like fond weeping mourners, lean over his grave.
    The lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle;
      He heeds not, he hears not, he 's free from all pain;
    He sleeps his last sleep, he has fought his last battle;
     No sound can awake him to glory again![666-1]

    Tho' nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle,
      No more on thy steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain:
    Thou sleep'st thy last sleep, thou hast fought thy last battle,
      No sound can awake thee to glory again.

PILPAY (OR BIDPAI.)[691-1]

     We ought to do our neighbour all the good we can. If you do good,
     good will be done to you; but if you do evil, the same will be
     measured back to you again.[691-2]

_Dabschelim and Pilpay. Chap. i._


     It has been the providence of Nature to give this creature [the
     cat] nine lives instead of one.[691-3]

_The Greedy and Ambitious Cat. Fable iii._


     There is no gathering the rose without being pricked by the
     thorns.[691-4]

_The Two Travellers. Chap. ii. Fable vi._


     Wise men say that there are three sorts of persons who are wholly
     deprived of judgment,--they who are ambitious of preferments in
     the courts of princes; they who make use of poison to show their
     skill in curing it; and they who intrust women with their
     secrets.

_The Two Travellers. Chap. ii. Fable vi._


     Men are used as they use others.

     himself a physician.

_The Ignorant Physician. Fable viii._


     He that plants thorns must never expect to gather roses.[692-1]

_The Ignorant Physician. Fable viii._


     Honest men esteem and value nothing so much in this world as a
     real friend. Such a one is as it were another self, to whom we
     impart our most secret thoughts, who partakes of our joy, and
     comforts us in our affliction; add to this, that his company is
     an everlasting pleasure to us.

     For full indeed is earth of woes, and full the sea; and in the

_Works and Days. Line 265._


     Badness, look you, you may choose easily in a heap: level is the
     path, and right near it dwells. But before Virtue the immortal
     gods have put the sweat of man's brow; and long and steep is the
     way to it, and rugged at the first.

_Works and Days. Line 360._


     At the beginning of the cask and at the end take thy fill, but be
     saving in the middle; for at the bottom saving comes too late.
     Let the price fixed with a friend be sufficient, and even dealing
     with a brother call in witnesses, but laughingly.

_Works and Days. Line 366._


     Diligence increaseth the fruit of toil. A dilatory man wrestles

     speaks the truth, gains no belief.

_Book i. Fable 10, 1._


     By this story [The Fox and the Raven] it is shown how much

     strength.

     No one returns with good-will to the place which has done him a
     mischief.

_Book i. Fable 18, 1._

     Things are not always what they seem.[716-1]

_Book iv. Fable 2, 5._


     Jupiter has loaded us with a couple of wallets: the one, filled

_Book iv. Fable 10, 1._


     A mountain was in labour, sending forth dreadful groans, and

FOOTNOTES:

    superficially.

PLINY THE ELDER. 23-79 A. D.

(_Translation by J. Bostock, M. D., and H. T. Riley, B. A., with slight
alterations._[716-4])

     In comparing various authors with one another, I have discovered
     that some of the gravest and latest writers have transcribed,
     word for word, from former works, without making acknowledgment.

_Natural History. Book i. Dedication, Sect. 22._


     The world, and whatever that be which we call the heavens, by the
     vault of which all things are enclosed, we must conceive to be a
     deity, to be eternal, without bounds, neither created nor subject
     at any time to destruction. To inquire what is beyond it is no
     concern of man; nor can the human mind form any conjecture
     concerning it.

_Natural History. Book ii. Sect. 1._


     It is ridiculous to suppose that the great head of things,
     whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs.

_Natural History. Book ii. Sect. 20._


     Everything is soothed by oil, and this is the reason why divers
     send out small quantities of it from their mouths, because it
     smooths every part which is rough.[717-1]

_Natural History. Book ii. Sect. 234._


     It is far from easy to determine whether she [Nature] has proved
     to him a kind parent or a merciless stepmother.[717-2]

_Natural History. Book vii. Sect. 1._


     Man alone at the very moment of his birth, cast naked upon the
     naked earth, does she abandon to cries and lamentations.[717-3]

_Natural History. Book vii. Sect. 2._


     To laugh, if but for an instant only, has never been granted to
     man before the fortieth day from his birth, and then it is looked
     upon as a miracle of precocity.[718-1]

_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 2._


     Man is the only one that knows nothing, that can learn nothing
     without being taught. He can neither speak nor walk nor eat, and
     in short he can do nothing at the prompting of nature only, but
     weep.[718-2]

_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 4._


     With man, most of his misfortunes are occasioned by man.[718-3]

_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 5._


     Indeed, what is there that does not appear marvellous when it
     comes to our knowledge for the first time?[718-4] How many
     things, too, are looked upon as quite impossible until they have
     been actually effected?

_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 6._


     The human features and countenance, although composed of but some
     ten parts or little more, are so fashioned that among so many
     thousands of men there are no two in existence who cannot be
     distinguished from one another.[718-5]

_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 8._


     All men possess in their bodies a poison which acts upon
     serpents; and the human saliva, it is said, makes them take to
     flight, as though they had been touched with boiling water. The
     same substance, it is said, destroys them the moment it enters
     their throat.[718-6]

_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 15._


     It has been observed that the height of a man from the crown of
     the head to the sole of the foot is equal to the distance between
     the tips of the middle fingers of the two hands when extended in
     a straight line.

_Natural History. Book vii. Sect. 77._


     When a building is about to fall down, all the mice desert
     it.[719-1]

_Natural History. Book viii. Sect. 103._


     Bears when first born are shapeless masses of white flesh a
     little larger than mice, their claws alone being prominent. The
     mother then licks them gradually into proper shape.[719-2]

_Natural History. Book viii. Sect. 126._


     It is asserted that the dogs keep running when they drink at the
     Nile, for fear of becoming a prey to the voracity of the
     crocodile.[719-3]

_Natural History. Book viii. Sect. 148._


     It has become quite a common proverb that in wine there is
     truth.[719-4]

_Natural History. Book xiv. Sect. 141._


     Cincinnatus was ploughing his four jugera of land upon the
     Vaticanian Hill,--the same that are still known as the Quintian
     Meadows,--when the messenger brought him the dictatorship,
     finding him, the tradition says, stripped to the work.

_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 20._


     The agricultural population, says Cato, produces the bravest men,
     the most valiant soldiers, and a class of citizens the least
     given of all to evil designs. . . . A bad bargain is always a
     ground for repentance.

_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 26._


     The best plan is, as the common proverb has it, to profit by the
     folly of others.[720-1]

_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 31._


     Always act in such a way as to secure the love of your
     neighbour.[720-2]

_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 44._


     It is a maxim universally agreed upon in agriculture, that
     nothing must be done too late; and again, that everything must be
     done at its proper season; while there is a third precept which
     reminds us that opportunities lost can never be regained.

_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 44._


     The bird of passage known to us as the cuckoo.

_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 249._


     Let not things, because they are common, enjoy for that the less
     share of our consideration.

_Natural History. Book xix. Sect. 59._


     Why is it that we entertain the belief that for every purpose odd
     numbers are the most effectual?[720-3]

_Natural History. Book xxviii. Sect. 23._


     It was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously
     adhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might be,
     without exercising himself by tracing some outline or other,--a
     practice which has now passed into a proverb.[720-4] It was also
     a practice with him, when he had completed a work, to exhibit it
     to the view of the passers-by in his studio, while he himself,
     concealed behind the picture, would listen to the criticisms. . .
     . Under these circumstances, they say that he was censured by a
     shoemaker for having represented the shoes with one latchet too
     few. The next day, the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing the
     former error corrected, thanks to his advice, began to criticise
     the leg; upon which Apelles, full of indignation, popped his head
     out and reminded him that a shoemaker should give no opinion
     beyond the shoes,[721-1]--a piece of advice which has equally
     passed into a proverbial saying.

_Natural History. Book xxxv. Sect. 84._

    contrary wind; but do you remember to cast this oil I give you
    into the sea, and the wind shall cease

[718-6] Madame d'Abrantes relates that when Bonaparte was in Cairo
    he sent for a serpent-detecter (Psylli) to remove two serpents
    that had been seen in his house. He having enticed one of them
    from his hiding-place, caught it in one hand, just below the
    jaw-bone, in such a manner as to oblige the mouth to open, when
    spitting into it, the effect was like magic: the reptile appeared
    struck with instant death.--_Memoirs, vol. i. chap. lix._

[719-1] This is alluded to by Cicero in his letters to Atticus,
    and is mentioned by Ælian (Animated Nature, book vi. chap. 41). It
    is like our proverb, "Rats leave a sinking ship."

    In the end of thirty dayes a shapeless birth;

    To a perfect beast that first deformed thing.

EPICTETUS. _Circa_ 60 A. D.

(_The translation used here is that of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, based
on that of Elizabeth Carter_ (1866).)

     To a reasonable creature, that alone is insupportable which is
     unreasonable; but everything reasonable may be supported.

_Discourses. Chap. ii._


     Yet God hath not only granted these faculties, by which we may
     bear every event without being depressed or broken by it, but
     like a good prince and a true father, hath placed their exercise
     above restraint, compulsion, or hindrance, and wholly without our
     own control.

_Discourses. Chap. vi._


     In a word, neither death, nor exile, nor pain, nor anything of
     this kind is the real cause of our doing or not doing any action,
     but our inward opinions and principles.

_Discourses. Chap. xi._


     Reason is not measured by size or height, but by principle.

_Discourses. Chap. xii._


     O slavish man! will you not bear with your own brother, who has
     God for his Father, as being a son from the same stock, and of
     the same high descent? But if you chance to be placed in some
     superior station, will you presently set yourself up for a
     tyrant?

_Discourses. Chap. xiii._


     When you have shut your doors, and darkened your room, remember
     never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; but God
     is within, and your genius is within,--and what need have they of
     light to see what you are doing?

_Discourses. Chap. xiv._


     No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of
     grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer
     you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear
     fruit, then ripen.

_Discourses. Chap. xv._


     Any one thing in the creation is sufficient to demonstrate a
     Providence to an humble and grateful mind.

_Discourses. Chap. xvi._


     Were I a nightingale, I would act the part of a nightingale; were
     I a swan, the part of a swan.

_Discourses. Chap. xvi._


     Since it is Reason which shapes and regulates all other things,
     it ought not itself to be left in disorder.

_Discourses. Chap. xvii._


     If what the philosophers say be true,--that all men's actions
     proceed from one source; that as they assent from a persuasion
     that a thing is so, and dissent from a persuasion that it is not,
     and suspend their judgment from a persuasion that it is
     uncertain,--so likewise they seek a thing from a persuasion that
     it is for their advantage.

_Discourses. Chap. xviii._


     Practise yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and
     thence proceed to greater.



_Discourses. Chap. xviii._


     Every art and every faculty contemplates certain things as its
     principal objects.

_Discourses. Chap. xx._


     Why, then, do you walk as if you had swallowed a ramrod?

_Discourses. Chap. xxi._


     When one maintains his proper attitude in life, he does not long
     after externals. What would you have, O man?

_Discourses. Chap. xxi._


     Difficulties are things that show what men are.

_Discourses. Chap. xxiv._


     If we are not stupid or insincere when we say that the good or
     ill of man lies within his own will, and that all beside is
     nothing to us, why are we still troubled?

_Discourses. Chap. xxv._


     In theory there is nothing to hinder our following what we are
     taught; but in life there are many things to draw us aside.

_Discourses. Chap. xxvi._


     Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what
     they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they
     are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to
     be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man's task.

_Discourses. Chap. xxvii._


     The appearance of things to the mind is the standard of every
     action to man.

_That we ought not to be angry with Mankind. Chap. xxviii._


     The essence of good and evil is a certain disposition of the
     will.

_Of Courage. Chap. xxix._


     It is not reasonings that are wanted now; for there are books
     stuffed full of stoical reasonings.

_Of Courage. Chap. xxix._


     For what constitutes a child?--Ignorance. What constitutes a
     child?--Want of instruction; for they are our equals so far as
     their degree of knowledge permits.



_That Courage is not inconsistent with Caution. Book ii. Chap. i._


     Appear to know only this,--never to fail nor fall.

_That Courage is not inconsistent with Caution. Book ii. Chap. i._


     The materials of action are variable, but the use we make of them
     should be constant.

_How Nobleness of Mind may be consistent with Prudence. Chap. v._


     Shall I show you the muscular training of a philosopher? "What
     muscles are those?"--A will undisappointed; evils avoided; powers
     daily exercised; careful resolutions; unerring decisions.

_Wherein consists the Essence of Good. Chap. viii._


     Dare to look up to God and say, "Make use of me for the future as
     Thou wilt. I am of the same mind; I am one with Thee. I refuse
     nothing which seems good to Thee. Lead me whither Thou wilt.
     Clothe me in whatever dress Thou wilt."

_That we do not study to make Use of the established Principles
concerning Good and Evil. Chap. xvi._


     What is the first business of one who studies philosophy? To part
     with self-conceit. For it is impossible for any one to begin to
     learn what he thinks that he already knows.

_How to apply general Principles to particular Cases. Chap. xvii._


     Every habit and faculty is preserved and increased by
     correspondent actions,--as the habit of walking, by walking; of
     running, by running.

_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._


     Whatever you would make habitual, practise it; and if you would
     not make a thing habitual, do not practise it, but habituate
     yourself to something else.

_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._


     Reckon the days in which you have not been angry. I used to be
     angry every day; now every other day; then every third and fourth
     day; and if you miss it so long as thirty days, offer a sacrifice
     of thanksgiving to God.



_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._


     Be not hurried away by excitement, but say, "Semblance, wait for
     me a little. Let me see what you are and what you represent. Let
     me try you."

_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._


     Things true and evident must of necessity be recognized by those
     who would contradict them.

_Concerning the Epicureans. Chap. xx._


     There are some things which men confess with ease, and others
     with difficulty.

_Of Inconsistency. Chap. xxi._


     Who is there whom bright and agreeable children do not attract to
     play and creep and prattle with them?

_Concerning a Person whom he treated with Disregard. Chap. xxiv._


     Two rules we should always have ready,--that there is nothing
     good or evil save in the will; and that we are not to lead
     events, but to follow them.

_In what Manner we ought to bear Sickness. Book iii. Chap. x._


     In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then
     undertake it.[746-1]

_That Everything is to be undertaken with Circumspection. Chap. xv._


     There is a fine circumstance connected with the character of a
     Cynic,--that he must be beaten like an ass, and yet when beaten
     must love those who beat him, as the father, as the brother of
     all.

_Of the Cynic Philosophy. Chap. xxii._


     First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you
     have to do.

_Concerning such as read and dispute ostentatiously. Chap. xxiii._


     Let not another's disobedience to Nature become an ill to you;
     for you were not born to be depressed and unhappy with others,
     but to be happy with them. And if any is unhappy, remember that
     he is so for himself; for God made all men to enjoy felicity and
     peace.

_That we ought not to be affected by Things not in our own Power. Chap.
xxiv._


     Everything has two handles,--one by which it may be borne;
     another by which it cannot.

_Enchiridion. xliii._

(_Translation by William Melmoth. Bohn's Classical Library._)

     Modestus said of Regulus that he was "the biggest rascal that
     walks upon two legs."

_Letters._[748-1] _Book i. Letter v. 14._


     There is nothing to write about, you say. Well, then, write and
     let me know just this,--that there _is_ nothing to write about;
     or tell me in the good old style if you are well. That 's right.
     I am quite well.[748-2]

_Letters. Book i. Letter xi. 1._


     Never do a thing concerning the rectitude of which you are in

MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS. 121-180 A. D.

(_Translated by M. H. Morgan, Ph. D., of Harvard University._)

     This Being of mine, whatever it really is, consists of a little
     flesh, a little breath, and the part which governs.

_Meditations. ii. 2._


     The ways of the gods are full of providence.

_Meditations. ii. 3._


     Thou wilt find rest from vain fancies if thou doest every act in
     life as though it were thy last.[749-1]

_Meditations. ii. 5._


     Thou seest how few be the things, the which if a man has at his
     command his life flows gently on and is divine.

_Meditations. ii. 5._


     Find time still to be learning somewhat good, and give up being
     desultory.

_Meditations. ii. 7._


     No state sorrier than that of the man who keeps up a continual
     round, and pries into "the secrets of the nether world," as saith
     the poet, and is curious in conjecture of what is in his
     neighbour's heart.

_Meditations. ii. 13._


     Though thou be destined to live three thousand years and as many
     myriads besides, yet remember that no man loseth other life than
     that which he liveth, nor liveth other than that which he loseth.

_Meditations. ii. 14._


     For a man can lose neither the past nor the future; for how can
     one take from him that which is not his? So remember these two
     points: first, that each thing is of like form from everlasting
     and comes round again in its cycle, and that it signifies not
     whether a man shall look upon the same things for a hundred years
     or two hundred, or for an infinity of time; second, that the
     longest lived and the shortest lived man, when they come to die,
     lose one and the same thing.

_Meditations. ii. 14._


     As for life, it is a battle and a sojourning in a strange land;
     but the fame that comes after is oblivion.

_Meditations. ii. 17._


     Waste not the remnant of thy life in those imaginations touching
     other folk, whereby thou contributest not to the common weal.

_Meditations. iii. 4._


     The lot assigned to every man is suited to him, and suits him to
     itself.[750-1]

_Meditations. iii. 4._


     Be not unwilling in what thou doest, neither selfish nor
     unadvised nor obstinate; let not over-refinement deck out thy
     thought; be not wordy nor a busybody.

_Meditations. iii. 5._


     A man should _be_ upright, not be _kept_ upright.

_Meditations. iii. 5._


     Never esteem anything as of advantage to thee that shall make
     thee break thy word or lose thy self-respect.

_Meditations. iii. 7._


     Respect the faculty that forms thy judgments.

_Meditations. iii. 9._


     Remember that man's life lies all within this present, as 't were
     but a hair's-breadth of time; as for the rest, the past is gone,
     the future yet unseen. Short, therefore, is man's life, and
     narrow is the corner of the earth wherein he dwells.

_Meditations. iii. 10._


     Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to
     investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy
     observation in life.

_Meditations. iii. 11._


     As surgeons keep their instruments and knives always at hand for
     cases requiring immediate treatment, so shouldst thou have thy
     thoughts ready to understand things divine and human, remembering
     in thy every act, even the smallest, how close is the bond that
     unites the two.

_Meditations. iii. 13._


     The ruling power within, when it is in its natural state, is so
     related to outer circumstances that it easily changes to accord
     with what can be done and what is given it to do.

_Meditations. iv. 1._


     Let no act be done at haphazard, nor otherwise than according to
     the finished rules that govern its kind.

_Meditations. iv. 2._


     By a tranquil mind I mean nothing else than a mind well ordered.

_Meditations. iv. 3._


     Think on this doctrine,--that reasoning beings were created for
     one another's sake; that to be patient is a branch of justice,
     and that men sin without intending it.

_Meditations. iv. 3._


     The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.

_Meditations. iv. 3._


     Nothing can come out of nothing, any more than a thing can go
     back to nothing.

_Meditations. iv. 4._


     Death, like generation, is a secret of Nature.

_Meditations. iv. 5._


     That which makes the man no worse than he was makes his life no
     worse: it has no power to harm, without or within.

_Meditations. iv. 8._


     Whatever happens at all happens as it should; thou wilt find this
     true, if thou shouldst watch narrowly.

_Meditations. iv. 10._


     Many the lumps of frankincense on the same altar; one falls there
     early and another late, but it makes no difference.

_Meditations. iv. 15._


     Be not as one that hath ten thousand years to live; death is nigh
     at hand: while thou livest, while thou hast time, be good.

_Meditations. iv. 17._


     How much time he gains who does not look to see what his
     neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does
     himself, to make it just and holy.

_Meditations. iv. 18._


     Whatever is in any way beautiful hath its source of beauty in
     itself, and is complete in itself; praise forms no part of it. So
     it is none the worse nor the better for being praised.



_Meditations. iv. 20._


     Doth perfect beauty stand in need of praise at all? Nay; no more
     than law, no more than truth, no more than loving kindness, nor
     than modesty.

_Meditations. iv. 20._


     All that is harmony for thee, O Universe, is in harmony with me
     as well. Nothing that comes at the right time for thee is too
     early or too late for me. Everything is fruit to me that thy
     seasons bring, O Nature. All things come of thee, have their
     being in thee, and return to thee.

_Meditations. iv. 23._


     "Let thine occupations be few," saith the sage,[752-1] "if thou
     wouldst lead a tranquil life."

_Meditations. iv. 24._


     Love the little trade which thou hast learned, and be content
     therewith.

_Meditations. iv. 31._


     Remember this,--that there is a proper dignity and proportion to
     be observed in the performance of every act of life.

_Meditations. iv. 32._


     All is ephemeral,--fame and the famous as well.

_Meditations. iv. 35._


     Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get
     used to thinking that there is nothing Nature loves so well as to
     change existing forms and to make new ones like them.

_Meditations. iv. 36._


     Search men's governing principles, and consider the wise, what
     they shun and what they cleave to.

_Meditations. iv. 38._


     Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its
     current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept
     by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away.

_Meditations. iv. 43._


     All that happens is as usual and familiar as the rose in spring
     and the crop in summer.

_Meditations. iv. 44._


     That which comes after ever conforms to that which has gone
     before.

_Meditations. iv. 45._


     Mark how fleeting and paltry is the estate of man,--yesterday in
     embryo, to-morrow a mummy or ashes. So for the hair's-breadth of
     time assigned to thee live rationally, and part with life
     cheerfully, as drops the ripe olive, extolling the season that
     bore it and the tree that matured it.

_Meditations. iv. 48._


     Deem not life a thing of consequence. For look at the yawning
     void of the future, and at that other limitless space, the past.

_Meditations. iv. 50._


     Always take the short cut; and that is the rational one.
     Therefore say and do everything according to soundest reason.

_Meditations. iv. 51._


     In the morning, when thou art sluggish at rousing thee, let this
     thought be present; "I am rising to a man's work."

_Meditations. v. 1._


     A man makes no noise over a good deed, but passes on to another
     as a vine to bear grapes again in season.

_Meditations. v. 6._


     Flinch not, neither give up nor despair, if the achieving of
     every act in accordance with right principle is not always
     continuous with thee.

_Meditations. v. 9._


     Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to
     bear.

_Meditations. v. 18._


     Prize that which is best in the universe; and this is that which
     useth everything and ordereth everything.

_Meditations. v. 21._


     Live with the gods.

_Meditations. v. 27._


     Look beneath the surface; let not the several quality of a thing
     nor its worth escape thee.

_Meditations. vi. 3._


     The controlling Intelligence understands its own nature, and what
     it does, and whereon it works.

_Meditations. vi. 5._


     Do not think that what is hard for thee to master is impossible
     for man; but if a thing is possible and proper to man, deem it
     attainable by thee.



_Meditations. vi. 19._


     If any man can convince me and bring home to me that I do not
     think or act aright, gladly will I change; for I search after
     truth, by which man never yet was harmed. But he is harmed who
     abideth on still in his deception and ignorance.

_Meditations. vi. 21._


     Death,--a stopping of impressions through the senses, and of the
     pulling of the cords of motion, and of the ways of thought, and
     of service to the flesh.

_Meditations. vi. 28._


     Suit thyself to the estate in which thy lot is cast.

_Meditations. vi. 39._


     What is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee.

_Meditations. vi. 54._


     How many, once lauded in song, are given over to the forgotten;
     and how many who sung their praises are clean gone long ago!

_Meditations. vii. 6._


     One Universe made up of all that is; and one God in it all, and
     one principle of Being, and one Law, the Reason, shared by all
     thinking creatures, and one Truth.

_Meditations. vii. 9._


     To a rational being it is the same thing to act according to
     nature and according to reason.

_Meditations. vii. 11._


     Let not thy mind run on what thou lackest as much as on what thou
     hast already.

_Meditations. vii. 27._


     Just as the sand-dunes, heaped one upon another, hide each the
     first, so in life the former deeds are quickly hidden by those
     that follow after.

_Meditations. vii. 34._


     The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far
     as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and
     is not apt to fall.

_Meditations. vii. 61._


     Remember this,--that very little is needed to make a happy life.

_Meditations. vii. 67._


     Remember that to change thy mind and to follow him that sets thee
     right, is to be none the less the free agent that thou wast
     before.



_Meditations. viii. 16._


     Look to the essence of a thing, whether it be a point of
     doctrine, of practice, or of interpretation.

_Meditations. viii. 22._


     A man's happiness,--to do the things proper to man.

_Meditations. viii. 26._


     Be not careless in deeds, nor confused in words, nor rambling in
     thought.

_Meditations. viii. 51._


     He that knows not what the world is, knows not where he is
     himself. He that knows not for what he was made, knows not what
     he is nor what the world is.

_Meditations. viii. 52._


     The nature of the universe is the nature of things that are. Now,
     things that are have kinship with things that are from the
     beginning. Further, this nature is styled Truth; and it is the
     first cause of all that is true.

_Meditations. ix. 1._


     He would be the finer gentleman that should leave the world
     without having tasted of lying or pretence of any sort, or of
     wantonness or conceit.

_Meditations. ix. 2._


     Think not disdainfully of death, but look on it with favour; for
     even death is one of the things that Nature wills.

_Meditations. ix. 3._


     A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone, not
     always he that has done something.

_Meditations. ix. 5._


     Blot out vain pomp; check impulse; quench appetite; keep reason
     under its own control.

_Meditations. ix. 7._


     Things that have a common quality ever quickly seek their kind.

_Meditations. ix. 9._


     All things are the same,--familiar in enterprise, momentary in
     endurance, coarse in substance. All things now are as they were
     in the day of those whom we have buried.

_Meditations. ix. 14._


     The happiness and unhappiness of the rational, social animal
     depends not on what he feels but on what he does; just as his
     virtue and vice consist not in feeling but in doing.



_Meditations. ix. 16._


     Everything is in a state of metamorphosis. Thou thyself art in
     everlasting change and in corruption to correspond; so is the
     whole universe.

_Meditations. ix. 19._


     Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any
     shall note it. . . . Be satisfied with success in even the
     smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.

_Meditations. ix. 29._


     He that dies in extreme old age will be reduced to the same state
     with him that is cut down untimely.

_Meditations. ix. 33._


     Whatever may befall thee, it was preordained for thee from
     everlasting.

_Meditations. x. 5._


     "The earth loveth the shower," and "the holy ether knoweth what
     love is."[756-1] The Universe, too, loves to create whatsoever is
     destined to be made.

_Meditations. x. 21._


     Remember that what pulls the strings is the force hidden within;
     there lies the power to persuade, there the life,--there, if one
     must speak out, the real man.

_Meditations. x. 38._


     No form of Nature is inferior to Art; for the arts merely imitate
     natural forms.

_Meditations. xi. 10._


     If it is not seemly, do it not; if it is not true, speak it not.

_Meditations. xii. 17._

DIOGENES LAERTIUS. _Circa_ 200 A. D.

(_From "The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers." Translated by C.
D. Yonge, B. A., with occasional corrections. Bohn's Classical Library._)

     Alcæus mentions Aristodemus in these  lines:--

    'T is money makes the man; and he who 's none
    Is counted neither good nor honourable.

_Thales. vii._


     Thales said there was no difference between life and death. "Why,
     then," said some one to him, "do not you die?" "Because," said
     he, "it _does_ make no difference."

_Thales. ix._


     When Thales was asked what was difficult, he said, "To know one's
     self." And what was easy, "To advise another."

_Thales. ix._


     He said that men ought to remember those friends who were absent
     as well as those who were present.

_Thales. ix._


     The apophthegm "Know thyself" is his.[757-1]

_Thales. xiii._


     Writers differ with respect to the apophthegms of the Seven
     Sages, attributing the same one to various authors.

_Thales. xiv._


     Solon used to say that speech was the image of actions; . . .
     that laws were like cobwebs,--for that if any trifling or
     powerless thing fell into them, they held it fast; while if it
     were something weightier, it broke through them and was off.

_Solon. x._


     Solon gave the following advice: "Consider your honour, as a
     gentleman, of more weight than an oath. Never tell a lie. Pay
     attention to matters of importance."

_Solon. xii._


     As some say, Solon was the author of the apophthegm, "Nothing in
     excess."[757-2]

_Solon. xvi._


     Chilo advised, "not to speak evil of the dead."[758-1]

_Chilo. ii._


     Pittacus said that half was more than the whole.[758-2]

_Pittacus. ii._


     Heraclitus says that Pittacus, when he had got Alcæus into his
     power, released him, saying, "Forgiveness is better than
     revenge."[758-3]

_Pittacus. iii._


     One of his sayings was, "Even the gods cannot strive against
     necessity."[758-4]

_Pittacus. iv._


     Another was, "Watch your opportunity."

_Pittacus. vii._


     Bias used to say that men ought to calculate life both as if they
     were fated to live a long and a short time, and that they ought
     to love one another as if at a future time they would come to
     hate one another; for that most men were bad.

_Bias. v._


     Ignorance plays the chief part among men, and the multitude of
     words;[758-5] but opportunity will prevail.

_Cleobulus. iv._


     The saying, "Practice is everything," is Periander's.[758-6]

_Periander. vi._


     Anarcharsis, on learning that the sides of a ship were four
     fingers thick, said that "the passengers were just that distance
     from death."[758-7]

_Anarcharsis. v._


     He used to say that it was better to have one friend of great
     value than many friends who were good for nothing.

_Anarcharsis. v._


     It was a common saying of Myson that men ought not to investigate
     things from words, but words from things; for that things are not
     made for the sake of words, but words for things.

_Myson. iii._


     Epimenides was sent by his father into the field to look for a
     sheep, turned out of the road at mid-day and lay down in a
     certain cave and fell asleep, and slept there fifty-seven years;
     and after that, when awake, he went on looking for the sheep,
     thinking that he had been taking a short nap.[759-1]

_Epimenides. ii._


     There are many marvellous stories told of Pherecydes. For it is
     said that he was walking along the seashore at Samos, and that
     seeing a ship sailing by with a fair wind, he said that it would
     soon sink; and presently it sank before his eyes. At another time
     he was drinking some water which had been drawn up out of a well,
     and he foretold that within three days there would be an
     earthquake; and there was one.

_Pherecydes. ii._


     Anaximander used to assert that the primary cause of all things
     was the Infinite,--not defining exactly whether he meant air or
     water or anything else.

_Anaximander. ii._


     Anaxagoras said to a man who was grieving because he was dying in
     a foreign land, "The descent to Hades is the same from every
     place."

_Anaxagoras. vi._


     Aristophanes turns Socrates into ridicule in his comedies, as
     making the worse appear the better reason.[759-2]

_Socrates. v._


     Often when he was looking on at auctions he would say, "How many
     things there are which I do not need!"

_Socrates. x._


     Socrates said, "Those who want fewest things are nearest to the
     gods."

_Socrates. xi._


     He said that there was one only good, namely, knowledge; and one
     only evil, namely, ignorance.

_Socrates. xiv._


     He declared that he knew nothing, except the fact of his
     ignorance.

_Socrates. xvi._


     Being asked whether it was better to marry or not, he replied,
     "Whichever you do, you will repent it."

_Socrates. xvi._


     He used to say that other men lived to eat, but that he ate to
     live.[760-1]

_Socrates. xvi._


     Aristippus being asked what were the most necessary things for
     well-born boys to learn, said, "Those things which they will put
     in practice when they become men."

_Aristippus. iv._


     Aristippus said that a wise man's country was the world.[760-2]

_Aristippus. xiii._


     Like sending owls to Athens, as the proverb goes.

_Plato. xxxii._


     Plato affirmed that the soul was immortal and clothed in many
     bodies successively.

     That virtue was sufficient of herself for happiness.[760-3]

_Plato. xlii._


     That the gods superintend all the affairs of men, and that there
     are such beings as dæmons.

_Plato. xlii._


     There is a written and an unwritten law. The one by which we
     regulate our constitutions in our cities is the written law; that
     which arises from custom is the unwritten law.

_Plato. li._


     Plato was continually saying to Xenocrates, "Sacrifice to the
     Graces."[760-4]

_Xenocrates. iii._


     Arcesilaus had a peculiar habit while conversing of using the
     expression, "My opinion is," and "So and so will not agree to
     this."

_Arcesilaus. xii._


     Bion used to say that the way to the shades below was easy; he
     could go there with his eyes shut.

_Bion. iii._


     Once when Bion was at sea in the company of some wicked men, he
     fell into the hands of pirates; and when the rest said, "We are
     undone if we are known,"--"But I," said he, "am undone if we are
     not known."

_Bion. iii._


     Of a rich man who was niggardly he said, "That man does not own
     his estate, but his estate owns him."

_Bion. iii._


     Bion insisted on the principle that "The property of friends is
     common."[761-1]

_Bion. ix._


     Very late in life, when he was studying geometry, some one said
     to Lacydes, "Is it then a time for you to be learning now?" "If
     it is not," he replied, "when will it be?"

_Lacydes. v._


     Aristotle was once asked what those who tell lies gain by it.
     Said he, "That when they speak truth they are not believed."

_Aristotle. xi._


     The question was put to him, what hope is; and his answer was,
     "The dream of a waking man."[761-2]

_Aristotle. xi._


     He used to say that personal beauty was a better introduction
     than any letter;[761-3] but others say that it was Diogenes who
     gave this description of it, while Aristotle called beauty "the
     gift of God;" that Socrates called it "a short-lived tyranny;"
     Theophrastus, "a silent deceit;" Theocritus, "an ivory mischief;"
     Carneades, "a sovereignty which stood in need of no guards."

_Aristotle. xi._


     On one occasion Aristotle was asked how much educated men were
     superior to those uneducated: "As much," said he, "as the living
     are to the dead."[762-1]

_Aristotle. xi._


     It was a saying of his that education was an ornament in
     prosperity and a refuge in adversity.

_Aristotle. xi._


     He was once asked what a friend is, and his answer was, "One soul
     abiding in two bodies."[762-2]

_Aristotle. xi._


     Asked what he gained from philosophy, he answered, "To do without
     being commanded what others do from fear of the laws."

_Aristotle. xi._


     The question was once put to him, how we ought to behave to our
     friends; and the answer he gave was, "As we should wish our
     friends to behave to us."

_Aristotle. xi._


     He used to define justice as "a virtue of the soul distributing
     that which each person deserved."

_Aristotle. xi._


     Another of his sayings was, that education was the best viaticum
     of old age.

_Aristotle. xi._


     The chief good he has defined to be the exercise of virtue in a
     perfect life.

_Aristotle. xiii._


     He used to teach that God is incorporeal, as Plato also asserted,
     and that his providence extends over all the heavenly bodies.

_Aristotle. xiii._


     It was a favourite expression of Theophrastus that time was the
     most valuable thing that a man could spend.[762-3]

_Theophrastus. x._


     Antisthenes used to say that envious people were devoured by
     their own disposition, just as iron is by rust.

_Antisthenes. iv._


     When he was praised by some wicked men, he said, "I am sadly
     afraid that I must have done some wicked thing."[763-1]

_Antisthenes. iv._


     When asked what learning was the most necessary, he said, "Not to
     unlearn what you have learned."

_Antisthenes. iv._


     Diogenes would frequently praise those who were about to marry,
     and yet did not marry.

_Diogenes. iv._


     "Bury me on my face," said Diogenes; and when he was asked why,
     he replied, "Because in a little while everything will be turned
     upside down."

_Diogenes. vi._


     One of the sayings of Diogenes was that most men were within a
     finger's breadth of being mad; for if a man walked with his
     middle finger pointing out, folks would think him mad, but not so
     if it were his forefinger.

_Diogenes. vi._


     All things are in common among friends.[763-2]

_Diogenes. vi._


     "Be of good cheer," said Diogenes; "I see land."

_Diogenes. vi._


     Plato having defined man to be a two-legged animal without
     feathers, Diogenes plucked a cock and brought it into the
     Academy, and said, "This is Plato's man." On which account this
     addition was made to the definition,--"With broad flat nails."

_Diogenes. vi._


     A man once asked Diogenes what was the proper time for supper,
     and he made answer, "If you are a rich man, whenever you please;
     and if you are a poor man, whenever you can."[763-3]

_Diogenes. vi._


     Diogenes lighted a candle in the daytime, and went round saying,
     "I am looking for a man."[763-4]

_Diogenes. vi._


     When asked what he would take to let a man give him a blow on the
     head, he said, "A helmet."

_Diogenes. vi._


     Once he saw a youth blushing, and addressed him, "Courage, my
     boy! that is the complexion of virtue."[764-1]

_Diogenes. vi._


     When asked what wine he liked to drink, he replied, "That which
     belongs to another."

_Diogenes. vi._


     Asked from what country he came, he replied, "I am a citizen of
     the world."[764-2]

_Diogenes. vi._


     When a man reproached him for going into unclean places, he said,
     "The sun too penetrates into privies, but is not polluted by
     them."[764-3]

_Diogenes. vi._


     Diogenes said once to a person who was showing him a dial, "It is
     a very useful thing to save a man from being too late for
     supper."

_Menedemus. iii._


     When Zeno was asked what a friend was, he replied, "Another
     I."[764-4]

_Zeno. xix._


     They say that the first inclination which an animal has is to
     protect itself.

_Zeno. lii._


     One ought to seek out virtue for its own sake, without being
     influenced by fear or hope, or by any external influence.
     Moreover, that in _that_ does happiness consist.[764-5]

_Zeno. liii._


     The Stoics also teach that God is unity, and that he is called
     Mind and Fate and Jupiter, and by many other names besides.

_Zeno. lxviii._


     They also say that God is an animal immortal, rational, perfect,
     and intellectual in his happiness, unsusceptible of any kind of
     evil, having a foreknowledge of the universe and of all that is
     in the universe; however, that he has not the figure of a man;
     and that he is the creator of the universe, and as it were the
     Father of all things in common, and that a portion of him
     pervades everything.

_Zeno. lxxii._


     But Chrysippus, Posidonius, Zeno, and Boëthus say, that all
     things are produced by fate. And fate is a connected cause of
     existing things, or the reason according to which the world is
     regulated.

_Zeno. lxxiv._


     Apollodorus says, "If any one were to take away from the books of
     Chrysippus all the passages which he quotes from other authors,
     his paper would be left empty."

_Chrysippus. iii._


     One of the sophisms of Chrysippus was, "If you have not lost a
     thing, you have it."

_Chrysippus. xi._


     Pythagoras used to say that he had received as a gift from
     Mercury the perpetual transmigration of his soul, so that it was
     constantly transmigrating and passing into all sorts of plants or
     animals.

_Pythagoras. iv._


     He calls drunkenness an expression identical with ruin.[765-1]

_Pythagoras. vi._


     Among what he called his precepts were such as these: Do not stir
     the fire with a sword. Do not sit down on a bushel. Do not devour
     thy heart.[765-2]

_Pythagoras. xvii._


     In the time of Pythagoras that proverbial phrase "Ipse
     dixit"[765-3] was introduced into ordinary life.

_Pythagoras. xxv._


     Xenophanes was the first person who asserted . . . that the soul
     is a spirit.

_Xenophanes. iii._


     It takes a wise man to discover a wise man.

_Xenophanes. iii._


     Protagoras asserted that there were two sides to every question,
     exactly opposite to each other.

_Protagoras. iii._


     Nothing can be produced out of nothing.[766-1]

_Diogenes of Apollonia. ii._


     Xenophanes speaks  thus:--

    And no man knows distinctly anything,
    And no man ever will.

_Pyrrho. viii._


     Democritus says, "But we know nothing really; for truth lies deep
     down."

_Pyrrho. viii._


     Euripides  says,--

    Who knows but that this life is really death,
    And whether death is not what men call life?

_Pyrrho. viii._


     The mountains, too, at a distance appear airy masses and smooth,
     but seen near at hand, they are rough.[766-2]

_Pyrrho. ix._


     If appearances are deceitful, then they do not deserve any
     confidence when they assert what appears to them to be true.

_Pyrrho. xi._


     The chief good is the suspension of the judgment, which
     tranquillity of mind follows like its shadow.

_Pyrrho. xi._


     Epicurus laid down the doctrine that pleasure was the chief good.

_Epicurus. vi._


     He alludes to the appearance of a face in the orb of the moon.

_Epicurus. xxv._


     Fortune is unstable, while our will is free.

_Epicurus. xxvii._

ATHENÆUS. _Circa_ 200 A. D.

(_Translation by C. D. Yonge, B. A._)

     It was a saying of Demetrius Phalereus, that "Men having often
     abandoned what was visible for the sake of what was uncertain,
     have not got what they expected, and have lost what they
     had,--being unfortunate by an enigmatical sort of
     calamity."[766-3]

_The Deipnosophists. vi. 23._


     Every investigation which is guided by principles of Nature fixes
     its ultimate aim entirely on gratifying the stomach.[767-1]

_The Deipnosophists. vii. 11._


     Dorion, ridiculing the description of a tempest in the "Nautilus"
     of Timotheus, said that he had seen a more formidable storm in a
     boiling saucepan.[767-2]

_The Deipnosophists. viii. 19._


     On one occasion some one put a very little wine into a
     wine-cooler, and said that it was sixteen years old. "It is very
     small for its age," said Gnathæna.

_The Deipnosophists. xiii. 47._

ALI BEN ABI TALEB.[767-6] ---- -660.

    Believe me, a thousand friends suffice thee not;
    In a single enemy thou hast more than enough.[767-7]



FOOTNOTES:

[767-6] Ali Ben Abi Taleb, son-in-law of Mahomet, and fourth
    caliph, who was for his courage called "The Lion of God," was
    murdered A. D. 660. He was the author of a "Hundred Sayings."

[767-7] Translated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, and wrongly called by
    him a translation from Omar Khayyám.

    Found in Dr. Hermann Tolowiez's "Polyglotte der Orientalischen
    Poesie."

    Translated by James Russell Lowell thus:--

    He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare,
    And he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.






OMAR KHAYYÁM. ---- -1123.

(_Translated by Edward Fitzgerald._)

    I sometimes think that never blows so red
    The Rose as where some buried Cæsar bled;
      That every Hyacinth the Garden wears
    Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.

_Rubáiyát. Stanza xix._


    A Moment's Halt--a momentary taste
    Of BEING from the Well amid the Waste--
      And, Lo! the phantom Caravan has reach'd

ALPHONSO THE WISE. 1221-1284.

     Had I been present at the creation, I would have given some
     useful hints for the better ordering of the universe.[768-1]

FOOTNOTES:

[768-1] Carlyle says, in his "History of Frederick the Great,"
    book ii. chap. vii. that this saying of Alphonso about Ptolemy's
    astronomy, "that it seemed a crank machine; that it was pity the
    Creator had not taken advice," is still remembered by
    mankind,--this and no other of his many sayings.

     Tell your master that if there were as many devils at Worms as
     tiles on its roofs, I would enter.[770-1]

     Here I stand; I can do no otherwise. God help me. Amen!

     will be making gods by dozens.

     have an interest in: the earth serves me to walk upon, the sun to
     light me; the stars have their influence upon me; I have such an
     advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing
     that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me. I am the
     darling of Nature! Is it not man that keeps and serves
     me?"[776-2]

_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._


     Arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and
     perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears

     Is it not a noble farce, wherein kings, republics, and emperors
     have for so many ages played their parts, and to which the whole
     vast universe serves for a theatre?[777-4]

_Book ii. Chap. xxxvi. Of the most Excellent Men._


     Nature forms us for ourselves, not for others; to be, not to
     seem.

_Book ii. Chap. xxxvii. Of the Resemblance of Children to their

     out the old one.

_Book iii. Chap. v. Upon some Verses of Virgil._


     All the world knows me in my book, and my book in me.

_Book iii. Chap. v. Upon some Verses of Virgil._


     'T is so much to be a king, that he only is so by being so. The
     strange lustre that surrounds him conceals and shrouds him from
     us; our sight is there broken and dissipated, being stopped and
     filled by the prevailing light.[778-3]

_Book iii. Chap. vii. Of the Inconveniences of Greatness._


     We are born to inquire after truth; it belongs to a greater power
     to possess it. It is not, as Democritus said, hid in the bottom

     divine knowledge.[778-4]

_Book iii. Chap. viii. Of the Art of Conversation._

     compatriots.

_Book iii. Chap. ix. Of Vanity._


     My appetite comes to me while eating.[779-1]

_Book iii. Chap. ix. Of Vanity._


     There is no man so good, who, were he to submit all his thoughts
     and actions to the laws, would not deserve hanging ten times in
     his life.

_Book iii. Chap. ix. Of Vanity._


     Saturninus said, "Comrades, you have lost a good captain to make

     disguising and altering it for some new service.[779-4]

_Book iii. Chap. xii. Of Physiognomy._


     I am further of opinion that it would be better for us to have
     [no laws] at all than to have them in so prodigious numbers as we
     have.

_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._


     There is more ado to interpret interpretations than to interpret
     the things, and more books upon books than upon all other
     subjects; we do nothing but comment upon one another.

_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._


     For truth itself has not the privilege to be spoken at all times
     and in all sorts.

_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._


     The diversity of physical arguments and opinions embraces all
     sorts of methods.

_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._


     Let us a little permit Nature to take her own way; she better
     understands her own affairs than we.

_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._


     I have ever loved to repose myself, whether sitting or lying,
     with my heels as high or higher than my head.

_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._


     I, who have so much and so universally adored this ariston
     metron, "excellent mediocrity,"[780-1] of ancient times, and who
     have concluded the most moderate measure the most perfect, shall
     I pretend to an unreasonable and prodigious old age?

(_From his "Divine Weekes and Workes," translated by J. Sylvester._)

    The world 's a stage[780-2] where God's omnipotence,
    His justice, knowledge, love, and providence
    Do act the parts.

_First Week, First Day._


    And reads, though running,[780-3] all these needful motions.

_First Week, First Day._


    Mercy and justice, marching cheek by joule.

_First Week, First Day._


    Not unlike the bear which bringeth forth
    In the end of thirty dayes a shapeless birth;
    But after licking, it in shape she drawes,
    And by degrees she fashions out the pawes,
    The head, and neck, and finally doth bring
    To a perfect beast that first deformed thing.[780-4]

_First Week, First Day._


    What is well done is done soon enough.

    Hot and cold, and moist and dry.[781-2]

_First Week, Second Day._


    Much like the French (or like ourselves, their apes),
    Who with strange habit do disguise their shapes;
    Who loving novels, full of affectation,
    Receive the manners of each other nation.[781-3]

_First Week, Second Day._


    With tooth and nail.

_First Week, Second Day._


    From the foure corners of the worlde doe haste.[781-4]

    Oft seen in forehead of the frowning skies.[781-5]

_First Week, Second Day._


    From north to south, from east to west.[781-6]

_First Week, Second Day._


            Bright-flaming, heat-full fire,
    The source of motion.[781-7]

_First Week, Second Day._


              Not that the earth doth yield
    In hill or dale, in forest or in field,
    A rarer plant.[781-8]

FRANCIS, DUC DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD. 1613-1680.

(_Reflections, or Sentences and Moral Maxims._)

     Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised.[794-2]

     We have all sufficient strength to endure the misfortunes of
     others.

_Maxim 19._


     Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils; but
     present evils triumph over it.[794-3]

_Maxim 22._


     We need greater virtues to sustain good than evil fortune.

_Maxim 25._


     Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.

_Maxim 26._


     Interest speaks all sorts of tongues, and plays all sorts of
     parts, even that of disinterestedness.

_Maxim 39._


     We are never so happy or so unhappy as we suppose.

_Maxim 49._


     There are few people who would not be ashamed of being loved when
     they love no longer.

_Maxim 71._


     True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few
     have seen.

_Maxim 76._


     The love of justice is simply, in the majority of men, the fear
     of suffering injustice.

_Maxim 78._


     Silence is the best resolve for him who distrusts himself.

_Maxim 79._


     Friendship is only a reciprocal conciliation of interests, and an
     exchange of good offices; it is a species of commerce out of
     which self-love always expects to gain something.

_Maxim 83._


     A man who is ungrateful is often less to blame than his
     benefactor.

_Maxim 96._


     The understanding is always the dupe of the heart.

_Maxim 102._


     Nothing is given so profusely as advice.

_Maxim 110._


     The true way to be deceived is to think oneself more knowing than
     others.

_Maxim 127._


     Usually we praise only to be praised.

_Maxim 146._


     Our repentance is not so much regret for the ill we have done as
     fear of the ill that may happen to us in consequence.

_Maxim 180._


     Most people judge men only by success or by fortune.

_Maxim 212._


     Hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue.

_Maxim 218._


     Too great haste to repay an obligation is a kind of ingratitude.

_Maxim 226._


     There is great ability in knowing how to conceal one's ability.

_Maxim 245._


     The pleasure of love is in loving. We are happier in the passion
     we feel than in that we inspire.[795-1]

_Maxim 259._


     We always like those who admire us; we do not always like those
     whom we admire.

_Maxim 294._


     The gratitude of most men is but a secret desire of receiving
     greater benefits.[796-1]

_Maxim 298._


     Lovers are never tired of each other, though they always speak of
     themselves.

_Maxim 312._


     We pardon in the degree that we love.

_Maxim 330._


     We hardly find any persons of good sense save those who agree
     with us.[796-2]

_Maxim 347._


     The greatest fault of a penetrating wit is to go beyond the mark.

_Maxim 377._


     We may give advice, but we cannot inspire the conduct.

_Maxim 378._


     The veracity which increases with old age is not far from folly.

_Maxim 416._


     In their first passion women love their lovers, in all the others
     they love love.[796-3]

_Maxim 471._


     Quarrels would not last long if the fault was only on one side.

_Maxim 496._


     In the adversity of our best friends we often find something that
     is not exactly displeasing.[796-4]

GESTA ROMANORUM.[802-1]

     We read of a certain Roman emperor who built a magnificent

     inscribed, "I have expended; I have given; I have kept; I have
     possessed; I do possess; I have lost; I am punished. What I

[802-2] Richard Gough, in the "Sepulchral Monuments of Great
    Britain," gives this epitaph of Robert Byrkes, which is to be
    found in Doncaster Church, "new cut" upon his tomb in Roman
    capitals:--

             Howe: Howe: who is heare:
    I, Robin of Doncaster, and Margaret my feare.
               That I spent, that I had;
               That I gave, that I have;
               That I left, that I lost.
                       A. D. 1579.

    The following is the epitaph of Edward Courtenay, Earl of
    Devonshire, according to Cleaveland's "Genealogical History of the
    Family of Courtenay," p. 142:--

    What we gave, we have;
    What we spent, we had;
    What we left, we lost.

FOOTNOTES:

[807-1] Count Münster, Hanoverian envoy at St. Petersburg,
    discovered that Russian civilization is "merely artificial," and
    first published to Europe the short description of the Russian
    Constitution,--that it is "absolutism tempered by assassination."

[807-2] A Greek proverb. A Cadmean victory was one in which the
    victors suffered as much as their enemies.

    EURIPIDES: _Fragment 656. Protesilaus._

[807-3] On the authority of Madame de Hausset ("Mémoires," p. 19),
    this phrase is ascribed to Madame de Pompadour. Larouse ("Fleurs
    Historiques") attributes it to Louis XV.

[807-4] It was from the imperial camp near Pavia that Francis I.,
    before leaving for Pizzighettone, wrote to his mother the
    memorable letter which, thanks to tradition, has become altered to
    the form of this sublime laconism: "Madame, tout est perdu fors
    l'honneur."

    The true expression is, "Madame, pour vous faire savoir comme se
    porte le reste de mon infortune, de toutes choses ne m'est demeuré
    que l'honneur et la vie qui est sauvé."--MARTIN: _Histoire de
    France, tome viii._

    The correction of this expression was first made by Sismondi, vol.
    xvi. pp. 241, 242. The letter itself is printed entire in
    Dulaure's "Histoire de Paris": "Pour vous avertir comment se porte
    le ressort de mon infortune, de toutes choses ne m'est demeuré que
    l'honneur et la vie,--qui est sauvé."

[807-5] Inserit se tantis viris mulier alienigeni sanguinis: quæ a

    La vue d'un tel monument est comme une musique continuelle et
    fixée.--MADAME DE STAËL: _Corinne, livre iv. chap. 3._

[808-1] Fournier asserts, on the written authority of Talleyrand's
    brother, that the only breviary used by the ex-bishop was
    "L'Improvisateur Français," a compilation of anecdotes and
    _bon-mots_, in twenty-one duo-decimo volumes. Whenever a good
    thing was wandering about in search of a parent, he adopted it;
    amongst others, "C'est le commencement de la fin."

    See Shakespeare, page 59.

[808-8] The reply of Marshal MacMahon, in the trenches before the
    Malakoff, in the siege of Sebastopol, September, 1855, to the
    commander-in-chief, who had sent him word to beware of an
    explosion which might follow the retreat of the Russians.

[808-9] Dulaure (History of Paris, 1863, p. 387) asserts that
    Louis XIV. interrupted a judge who used the expression, "The king
    and the state," by saying, "I am the state."

[808-10] Said by General Pierre Bosquet of the charge of the Light
    Brigade at the battle of Balaklava.

[809-1] EURIPIDES: _Heracleidæ, 1002._

    This may be traced to a response of the Delphic oracle given to
    Polycrates, as the best means of finding a treasure buried by
    Xerxes' general, Mardonius, on the field of Platæa. The oracle
    replied, Panta lithon kinei, "Turn every stone."--LEUTSCH AND
    SCHNEIDEWIN: _Corpus Paræmiographorum Græcorum, vol. i. p. 146._

[809-2] This phrase, "Laissez faire, laissez passer!" is
    attributed to Gournay, Minister of Commerce at Paris, 1751; also
    to Quesnay, the writer on political economy. It is quoted by Adam
    Smith in the "Wealth of Nations."

[809-3] Inscription over the door of the Library at
    Thebes.--DIODORUS SICULUS: _i. 49, 3._

[809-4] According to the "Contemporary Review," February, 1854,
    this phrase formed the opening of an address composed in the name
    of Comte d'Artois by Count Beugnot, and published in the
    "Moniteur," April 12, 1814.

[809-5] General Sebastiani announced the fall of Warsaw in the
    Chamber of Deputies, Sept. 16, 1831: "Des lettres que je reçois de
    Pologne m'annoncent que la tranquillité règne à Varsovie."--DUMAS:
    _Mémoires, Second Series, vol. iv. chap. iii._

[809-6] See Ovid, page 707.

              They were setting on
    Ossa upon Olympus, and upon
    Steep Ossa leavy Pelius.

    CHAPMAN: _Homer's Odyssey, book xi. 426._


    Heav'd on Olympus tott'ring Ossa stood;
    On Ossa Pelion nods with all his wood.

    POPE: _Odyssey, book xi. 387._


    Ossa on Olympus heave, on Ossa roll
    Pelion with all his woods; so scale the starry pole.

    SOTHEBY: _Odyssey, book xi. 315._


    To the Olympian summit they essay'd
    To heave up Ossa, and to Ossa's crown
    Branch-waving Pelion.

    COWPER: _Odyssey, book xi. 379._


    They on Olympus Ossa fain would roll;
    On Ossa Pelion's leaf-quivering hill.

    WORSLEY: _Odyssey, book xi. 414._


                         To fling
    Ossa upon Olympus, and to pile
    Pelion with all its growth of leafy woods
    On Ossa.

    BRYANT: _Odyssey, book xi. 390._


    Ossa they pressed down with Pelion's weight,
    And on them both impos'd Olympus' hill.

    FITZ-GEFFREY: _The Life and Death of Sir Francis Drake, stanza 99_
    (1596).


    Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam.--VIRGIL: _Georgics, i. 281._

[810-1] See Shakespeare, page 64.

[810-2] See Rabelais, page 771.

    Æschines (Adv. Ctesiphon, c. 53) ascribes to Demosthenes the
    expression ypotetmêtai ta neura tôn pragmatôn, "The sinews of
    affairs are cut." Diogenes Laertius, in his Life of Bion (lib. iv.
    c. 7, sect. 3), represents that philosopher as saying, ton plouton
    einai neura pragmatôn,--"Riches were the sinews of business," or,
    as the phrase may mean, "of the state." Referring perhaps to this
    maxim of Bion, Plutarch says in his Life of Cleomenes (c. 27), "He
    who first called money the sinews of the state seems to have said
    this with special reference to war." Accordingly we find money
    called expressly ta neura tou polemou, "the sinews of war," in
    Libanius, Orat. xlvi. (vol. ii. p. 477, ed. Reiske), and by the
    scholiast on Pindar, Olymp. i. 4 (compare Photius, Lex. _s. v._
    Meganoros plouton). So Cicero, Philipp. v. 2, "nervos belli,
    infinitam pecuniam."

[810-3] A placard of Aldus on the door of his
    printing-office.--DIBDIN: _Introduction, vol. i. p. 436._

[810-4] This saying occurs in Louis Napoleon's speech to the
    Chamber of Commerce in Bordeaux, Oct. 9, 1852.

[810-5] Words engraved upon the monument erected to Cambronne at
    Nantes.

    This phrase, attributed to Cambronne, who was made prisoner at
    Waterloo, was vehemently denied by him. It was invented by
    Rougemont, a prolific author of _mots_, two days after the battle,
    in the "Indépendant."--FOURNIER: _L' Esprit dans l' Histoire._

[810-6] A motto adopted by Thiers for the "Nationale," July 1,
    1803. In the beginning of the seventeenth century Jan Zamoyski in
    the Polish parliament said, "The king reigns, but does not
    govern."

[811-1] BUFFON: _Discours de Réception_ (Recueil de l'Académie,
    1753). See Burton, page 186.

[811-2] PROCLUS: _Commentary on Euclid's Elements, book ii. chap.
    iv._

[811-3] Attributed to Mademoiselle Bertin, milliner to Marie
    Antoinette.

    "There is nothing new except that which has become
    antiquated,"--motto of the "Revue Rétrospective."

[811-4] This saying is attributed to Talleyrand. In a letter of
    the Chevalier de Panat to Mallet du Pan, January, 1796, it occurs
    almost literally,--"No one is right; no one could forget anything,
    nor learn anything."

[811-5] Words uttered by Comte de Salvandy (1796-1856) at a fete
    given by the Duke of Orleans to the King of Naples, 1830.

[811-6] Attributed to Luther, but more probably a saying of J. H.
    Voss (1751-1826), according to Redlich, "Die poetischen Beiträge
    zum Waudsbecker Bothen," Hamburg, 1871, p. 67.--KING: _Classical
    and Foreign Quotations_ (1887).

[811-7] See Gibbon, page 430.

    Napoleon said, "Providence is always on the side of the last
    reserve."

[811-8] Anonymous translation from "Tait's Magazine," July, 1850.
    The poem is of an age earlier than that of Mahomet.

APPENDIX.


All the brothers were valiant, and all the sisters virtuous.

     From the inscription on the tomb of the Duchess of Newcastle in
     Westminster Abbey.

Am I not a man and a brother?

     From a medallion by Wedgwood (1787), representing a negro in
     chains, with one knee on the ground, and both hands lifted up to
     heaven. This was adopted as a characteristic seal by the
     Antislavery Society of London.

Anything for a quiet life.

     Title of a play by Middleton.

Art and part.

     A Scotch law-phrase,--an accessory before and after the fact. A
     man is said to be _art and part_ of a crime when he contrives the
     manner of the deed, and concurs with and encourages those who
     commit the crime, although he does not put his own hand to the
     actual execution of it.--SCOTT: _Tales of a Grandfather, chap.
     xxii._ (_Execution of Morton._)

Art preservative of all arts.

     From the inscription upon the façade of the house at Harlem
     formerly occupied by Laurent Koster (or Coster), who is charged,
     among others, with the invention of printing. Mention is first
     made of this inscription about  1628:--

        MEMORIÆ SACRUM
         TYPOGARAPHIA
      ARS ARTIUM OMNIUM
        CONSERVATRIX.
     HIC PRIMUM INVENTA
    CIRCA ANNUM MCCCCXL.

As gingerly.

     CHAPMAN: _May Day._ SHAKESPEARE: _Two Gentlemen of Verona._

Be sure you are right, then go ahead.

     The motto of David Crockett in the war of 1812.

Before you could say Jack Robinson.

     This current phrase is said to be derived from a humorous song by
     Hudson, a tobacconist in Shoe Lane, London. He was a professional
     song-writer and vocalist, who used to be engaged to sing at
     supper-rooms and theatrical houses.

    A warke it ys as easie to be done
    As tys to saye _Jacke! robys on_.

     HALLIWELL: _Archæological Dictionary._ (Cited from an old Play.)


Begging the question.

     This is a common logical fallacy, _petitio principii_; and the
     first explanation of the phrase is to be found in Aristotle's
     "Topica," viii. 13, where the five ways of begging the question
     are set forth. The earliest English work in which the expression
     is found is "The Arte of Logike plainlie set forth in our English
     Tongue, &c." (1584.)

Better to wear out than to rust out.

     When a friend told Bishop Cumberland (1632-1718) he would wear
     himself out by his incessant application, "It is better," replied
     the Bishop, "to wear out than to rust out."--HORNE: _Sermon on
     the Duty of Contending for the Truth._

     BOSWELL: _Tour to the Hebrides, p. 18, note._

Beware of a man of one book.

     When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked in what manner a man might best
     become learned, he answered, "By reading one book." The _homo
     unius libri_ is indeed proverbially formidable to all
     conversational figurantes.--SOUTHEY: _The Doctor, p. 164._

Bitter end.

     This phrase is nearly without meaning as it is used. The true
     phrase, "better end," is used properly to designate a crisis, or
     the moment of an extremity. When in a gale a vessel has paid out
     all her cable, her cable has run out to the "better end,"--the
     end which is secured within the vessel and little used. Robinson
     Crusoe in describing the terrible storm in Yarmouth Roads says,
     "We rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the
     better end."

Cockles of the heart.

     Latham says the most probable explanation of this phrase lies (1)
     in the likeness of a heart to a cockleshell,--the base of the
     former being compared to the hinge of the latter; (2) in the
     zoölogical name for the cockle and its congeners being
     _Cardium_, from kardia (heart).

Castles in the air.

     This is a proverbial phrase found throughout English literature,
     the first instance noted being in Sir Philip Sidney's "Defence of
     Poesy."

Consistency, thou art a jewel.

     This is one of those popular sayings--like "Be good, and you will
     be happy," or "Virtue is its own reward"--that, like Topsy,
     "never _was_ born, only jist growed." From the earliest times it
     has been the popular tendency to call this or that cardinal
     virtue, or bright and shining excellence, a jewel, by way of
     emphasis. For example, Iago  says,--

    "_Good name_, in man or woman, dear my lord,
     Is the immediate _jewel_ of their souls."

     Shakespeare elsewhere calls _experience_ a "jewel." Miranda says
     her _modesty_ is the "jewel" in her dower; and in "All 's Well
     that ends Well," Diana terms her _chastity_ the "jewel" of her
     house.--R. A. WIGHT.

     O discretion, thou art a jewel!--_The Skylark, a Collection of
     well-chosen English Songs._ (London, 1772.)

     The origin of this expression is unknown. Some wag of the day
     allayed public curiosity in regard to its source with the
     information that it is from the ballad of Robin Roughhead in
     Murtagh's "Collection of Ballads (1754)." It is needless to say
     that Murtagh is a verbal phantom, and the ballad of Robin
     Roughhead first appeared in an American newspaper in 1867.

Cotton is King; or, Slavery in the Light of Political Economy.

     This is the title of a book by David Christy (1855).

     The expression "Cotton is king" was used by James Henry Hammond
     in the United States Senate, March, 1858.

Dead as Chelsea.

     To get Chelsea: to obtain the benefit of that hospital. "Dead as
     Chelsea, by God!" an exclamation uttered by a grenadier at
     Fontenoy, on having his leg carried away by a
     cannon-ball.--_Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, 1758 (quoted by
     Brady, "Varieties of Literature," 1826).

Die in the last ditch.

     To William of Orange may be ascribed this saying. When Buckingham
     urged the inevitable destruction which hung over the United
     Provinces, and asked him whether he did not see that the
     commonwealth was ruined, "There is one certain means," replied
     the Prince, "by which I can be sure never to see my country's
     ruin,--I will die in the last ditch."--HUME: _History of
     England._ (1622.)

Drive a coach and six through an Act of Parliament.

     Macaulay ("History of England," chap. xii.) gives a saying "often
     in the mouth of Stephen Rice [afterward Chief Baron of the
     Exchequer], 'I will drive a coach and six through the Act of
     Settlement.'"

During good behaviour.

     That after the said limitation shall take effect, . . . judge's
     commissions be made _quando se bene gesserit_.--_Statutes 12 and
     13 William III. c. 2, sect. 3._

Eclipse first, the rest nowhere.

     Declared by Captain O'Kelley at Epsom, May 3, 1769.--_Annals of
     Sporting, vol. ii. p. 271._

Emerald Isle.

     Dr. William Drennan (1754-1820) says this expression was first
     used in a party song called "Erin, to her own Tune," written in
     1795. The song appears to have been anonymous.

Era of good feeling.

     The title of an article in the "Boston Centinel," July 12, 1817.

Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.

     It is the common fate of the indolent to see their rights become
     a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath given
     liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break,
     servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the
     punishment of his guilt.--JOHN PHILPOT CURRAN: _Speech upon the
     Right of Election, 1790._ (_Speeches. Dublin, 1808._)

     There is one safeguard known generally to the wise, which is an
     advantage and security to all, but especially to democracies as
     against despots. What is it? Distrust.--DEMOSTHENES: _Philippic

Gentle craft.

     According to Brady ("Clavis Calendaria"), this designation arose
     from the fact that in an old romance a prince of the name of
     Crispin is made to exercise, in honour of his namesake, Saint
     Crispin, the trade of shoemaking. There is a tradition that King
     Edward IV., in one of his disguises, once drank with a party of
     shoemakers, and pledged them. The story is alluded to in the old
     play of "George a-Greene"  (1599):--

    Marry, because you have drank with the King,
    And the King hath so graciously pledged you,
    You shall no more be called shoemakers;
    But you and yours, to the world's end,
    Shall be called the trade of the gentle craft.

Gentlemen of the French guard, fire first.

     Lord C. Hay at the battle of Fontenoy, 1745. To which the Comte
     d'Auteroches replied, "Sir, we never fire first; please to fire
     yourselves."--FOURNIER: _L'Esprit dans l'histoire._

Good as a play.

     An exclamation of Charles II. when in Parliament attending the
     discussion of Lord Ross's Divorce Bill.

     The king remained in the House of Peers while his speech was
     taken into consideration,--a common practice with him; for the
     debates amused his sated mind, and were sometimes, he used to
     say, as good as a comedy.--MACAULAY: _Review of the Life and
     Writings of Sir William Temple._

Greatest happiness of the greatest number.

     That action is best which procures the greatest happiness for the

     Evil, sect. 3._ (1720.)

     Priestley was the first (unless it was Beccaria) who taught my
     lips to pronounce this sacred truth,--that the greatest happiness
     of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and
     legislation.--BENTHAM: _Works, vol. x. p. 142._

     The expression is used by Beccaria in the introduction to his
     "Essay on Crimes and Punishments." (1764.)

Hobson's choice.

     Tobias Hobson (died 1630) was the first man in England that let
     out hackney horses. When a man came for a horse he was led into
     the stable, where there was a great choice, but he obliged him to
     take the horse which stood next to the stable-door; so that every
     customer was alike well served according to his chance,--from
     whence it became a proverb when what ought to be your election
     was forced upon you, to say, "Hobson's choice."--_Spectator, No.
     509._

    Where to elect there is but one,
    'T is Hobson's choice,--take that or none.

Intolerable in Almighty God to a black beetle.

     Lord Coleridge remarked that Maule told him what he said in the
     "black beetle" matter: "Creswell, who had been his pupil, was on
     the other side in a case where he was counsel, and was very lofty
     in his manner. Maule appealed to the court: 'My lords, we are
     vertebrate animals, we are mammalia! My learned friend's manner
     would be intolerable in Almighty God to a black beetle.'"
     (Repeated to a member of the legal profession in the United
     States.)

It is a far cry to Lochow.

     Lochow and the adjacent districts formed the original seat of the
     Campbells. The expression of "a far cry to Lochow" was
     proverbial. (Note to Scott's "Rob Roy," chap. xxix.)

Nation of shopkeepers.

     From an oration purporting to have been delivered by Samuel Adams
     at the State House in Philadelphia, Aug. 1, 1776. (Philadelphia,
     printed; London, reprinted for E. Johnson, No. 4 Ludgate Hill,
     1776.) W. V. Wells, in his Life of Adams, says: "No such American
     edition has ever been seen, but at least four copies are known of
     the London issue. A German translation of this oration was
     printed in 1778, perhaps at Berne; the place of publication is
     not given."

     To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a
     people of customers may at first sight appear a project fit only
     for a nation of shopkeepers.--ADAM SMITH: _Wealth of Nations,
     vol. ii. book iv. chap. vii. part 3._ (1775.)

     This new page opened in the book of our public expenditures, and
     this new departure taken, which leads into the bottomless gulf of
     civil pensions and family gratuities.--T. H. BENTON: _Speech in
     the U. S. Senate against a grant to President Harrison's widow,
     April, 1841._

Nothing succeeds like success.

     (Rien ne réussit comme le succès.--DUMAS: _Ange Pitou, vol. i. p.
     72. 1854._) A French proverb.

Orthodoxy is my doxy; Heterodoxy is another man's doxy.

     "I have heard frequent use," said the late Lord Sandwich, in a
     debate on the Test Laws, "of the words 'orthodoxy' and
     'heterodoxy;' but I confess myself at a loss to know precisely
     what they mean." "Orthodoxy, my Lord," said Bishop Warburton, in
     a whisper,--"orthodoxy is my doxy; heterodoxy is another man's
     doxy."--PRIESTLEY: _Memoirs, vol. i. p. 572._

Paradise of fools; Fool's paradise.

     The earliest instance of this expression is found in William
     Bullein's "Dialogue," p. 28 (1573). It is used by Shakespeare,
     Middleton, Milton, Pope, Fielding, Crabbe, and others.

Paying through the nose.

     Grimm says that Odin had a poll-tax which was called in Sweden a
     nose-tax; it was a penny per nose, or poll.--_Deutsche Rechts
     Alterthümer._

Public trusts.

     It is not fit the public trusts should be lodged in the hands of
     any till they are first proved, and found fit for the business
     they are to be intrusted with.--MATHEW HENRY: _Commentaries,
     Timothy iii._

     To execute laws is a royal office; to execute orders is not to be
     a king. However, a political executive magistracy, though merely
     such, is a great trust.--BURKE: _On the French Revolution._

     When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as
     public property.--THOMAS JEFFERSON ("Winter in Washington,
     1807"), in a conversation with Baron Humboldt. See Rayner's "Life
     of Jefferson," p. 356 (Boston, 1834).

     The very essence of a free government consists in considering
     offices as public trusts, bestowed for the good of the country,
     and not for the benefit of an individual or a party.--JOHN C.
     CALHOUN: _Speech, July 13, 1835._

     The phrase, "public office is a public trust," has of late become
     common property.--CHARLES SUMNER (May 31, 1872).

     The appointing power of the pope is treated as a public
     trust.--W. W. CRAPO (1881).

     The public offices are a public trust.--DORMAN B. EATON (1881).

     Public office is a public trust.--ABRAM S. HEWITT (1883).

     He who regards office as a public trust.--DANIEL S. LAMONT
     (1884).

Rather your room as your company.

     _Marriage of Wit and Wisdom_ (_circa_ 1570).

Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.

     From an inscription on the cannon near which the ashes of
     President John Bradshaw were lodged, on the top of a high hill
     near Martha Bay in Jamaica.--STILES: _History of the Three Judges
     of King Charles I._

     This supposititious epitaph was found among the papers of Mr.
     Jefferson, and in his handwriting. It was supposed to be one of
     Dr. Franklin's spirit-stirring inspirations.--RANDALL: _Life of
     Jefferson, vol. iii. p. 585._

Rest and be thankful.

     An inscription on a stone seat on the top of one of the Highlands
     in Scotland. It is also the title of one of Wordsworth's poems.

Rowland for an Oliver.

     These were two of the most famous in the list of Charlemagne's
     twelve peers; and their exploits are rendered so ridiculously and
     equally extravagant by the old romancers, that from thence arose
     that saying amongst our plain and sensible ancestors of giving
     one a "Rowland for his Oliver," to signify the matching one
     incredible lie with another.--THOMAS WARBURTON.

Sardonic smile.

     The island of Sardinia, consisting chiefly of marshes and
     mountains, has from the earliest period to the present been
     cursed with a noxious air, an ill-cultivated soil, and a scanty
     population. The convulsions produced by its poisonous plants gave
     rise to the expression of sardonic smile, which is as old as
     Homer (Odyssey, xx. 302).--MAHON: _History of England, vol. i. p.
     287._

     The explanation given by Mahon of the meaning of "sardonic smile"
     is to be sure the traditional one, and was believed in by the
     late classical writers. But in the Homeric passage referred to,
     the word is "sard_a_nion" (sardanion), not "sard_o_nion." There
     is no evidence that Sardinia was known to the composers of what
     we call Homer. It looks as though the word was to be connected
     with the verb sairô, "show the teeth;" "grin like a dog;" hence
     that the "sardonic smile" was a "grim laugh."--M. H. MORGAN.

Sister Anne, do you see any one coming?

     The anxious question of one of the wives of Bluebeard.

Stone-wall Jackson.

     This saying took its rise from the battle of Bull Run, July 21,
     1861. Said General Bernard E. Bee, "See, there is Jackson,
     standing like a stone-wall."

The King is dead! Long live the King!

     The death of Louis XIV. was announced by the captain of the
     bodyguard from a window of the state apartment. Raising his
     truncheon above his head, he broke it in the centre, and throwing
     the pieces among the crowd, exclaimed in a loud voice, "Le Roi
     est mort!" Then seizing another staff, he flourished it in the
     air as he shouted, "Vive le Roi!"--PARDOE: _Life of Louis XIV.,
     vol. iii. p. 457._

The woods are full of them!

     Alexander Wilson, in the Preface to his "American Ornithology"
     (1808), quotes these words, and relates the story of a boy who
     had been gathering flowers. On bringing them to his mother, he
     said: "Look, my dear ma! What beautiful flowers I have found
     growing in our place! Why, all the woods are full of them!"

Thin red line.

     The Russians dashed on towards that thin red-line streak tipped
     with a line of steel.--RUSSELL: _The British Expedition to the
     Crimea_ (revised edition), _p. 187_.

     Soon the men of the column began to see that though the scarlet
     line was slender, it was very rigid and exact.--KINGLAKE:
     _Invasion of the Crimea, vol. iii. p. 455._

     The spruce beauty of the slender red line.--_Ibid._ (sixth
     edition), _vol. iii. p. 248_.

What you are pleased to call your mind.

     A solicitor, after hearing Lord Westbury's opinion, ventured to
     say that he had turned the matter over in his mind, and thought
     that something might be said on the other side; to which he
     replied, "Then, sir, you will turn it over once more in what you
     are _pleased to call your mind_."--NASH: _Life of Lord Westbury,
     vol. ii. 292._

Transcriber's Notes:

1. Formatting of punctuation has been standardised, including the
addition of trailing periods in the text and the index and the addition
of commas preceding the page numbers in the index.

2. Formatting of footnotes with respect to small caps and punctuation has
been standardised.

3. This text has numerous quirks:
--the index is sometimes not in alphabetical order, in particular the
  plural of a headword often immediately follows the singular of a
  headword.
--quotations are sometimes not in numerical line number order
--index entries often contain full words, where the original quote contains
  contractions
--index entries often contain duplicate head words
--index entries often do not replicate the punctuation or exact spelling of
  the original quotation.

4. Use of a text search facility for research within this text is
recommended. Please take a moment to admire the people who compileda 300
page index without the use of automated word processing.
