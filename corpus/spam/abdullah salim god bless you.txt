God bless you
I am Mr.Abdullah Salim from Misrata, Libya. I lost my father who was a serving military chief under Col Muammar Gaddafi collapsed regime.
I am presently on exile in UAE and need urgent assistance to present foreign beneficiary to enable me take possession of my family Gold.
All I want is a reliable partner that can come in as my business partner and receive the three (3) trunk boxes containing Cash, Gold so that we share 60/40. I have all the proofing documents and will be sending it to you upon receipt of your full consent.
May God bless us all as I wait your prompt response confirming your readiness to help me achieve this business for real and good of us all.
Yours truly,
Al-Issah Salim
