introducing
doctor - formulated
hgh
human growth hormone - also called hgh
is referred to in medical science as the master hormone. it is very plentiful
when we are young, but near the age of twenty - one our bodies begin to produce
less of it. by the time we are forty nearly everyone is deficient in hgh,
and at eighty our production has normally diminished at least 90-95 %.
advantages of hgh:
- increased muscle strength
- loss in body fat
- increased bone density
- lower blood pressure
- quickens wound healing
- reduces cellulite
- improved vision
- wrinkle disappearance
- increased skin thickness texture
- increased energy levels
- improved sleep and emotional stability
- improved memory and mental alertness
- increased sexual potency
- resistance to common illness
- strengthened heart muscle
- controlled cholesterol
- controlled mood swings
- new hair growth and color restore

Subject: await your response
dear partner,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate.
at the moment, we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies, which we intend to transfer to your account, upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you. based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity, loyalty and understanding, we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly. all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative, as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit, that will turn around profit favourably. we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture, and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with. also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $13,731,000,00 usd (thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover, please it should be within the set aside capital. in this regard, the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding; with special emphasis on the following:
1. the tax obligationin your country
2. the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area, as well as;
3. the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4. the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement.
5. your ability to provide a beneficiary/partnership account with a minimal deposit, where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently.
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on, is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing. since we are the owners of the funds, and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country, we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds, without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations. remember that, on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds. you will be the one to be doing all these, and in the course of transfer, if for any reason whatsoever, you incurred some bills, we shall adequately retire same, upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account. the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen, and to trust your personality and status, especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody.
i await your response,
sincerely,
john adams
(chairman senate committee on banks and currency)

it's true!
you can go on a fabulous cruise where
all your meals and activities are included,
where your destination is the beautiful nassau
island in the bahamas, a place that will take
your breath away. you'll stay 3 glorious days
in the sun in the grand bahama island before
leaving on a romantic moonlit cruise back to florida.

ok what's the catch?
not a one...
except space is limited and will be booked on
a first come first serve basis. the cruise lines and hotels do
not want any empty space. they would rather practically give the
rooms away in hopes that you'll spend time and money in the
casino
or some of the many gift shops. even if you don't know a travel date
now, you can book any time in the next 18 months with 60 days
notice.
they don't expect this drop in tourism to last forever so take
advantage
now while you can. at this price, you can take the kids or treat your
mom and dad or do a mother daughter thing or take a second
honeymoon.
with the actual vacation costs so low, you'll be able to do the things
you've always wanted to on vacation. to learn more about this

Subject: from mrs. juliana
dear friend,
please don't be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now. i am mrs. juliana mbuluku makele, the
wife of late tate makele, a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country. i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you.
before the death of my husband, he made a deposit with a security firm.
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents. the actual
content is the sum of us 25. 5 million (twenty five million, five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only). this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies. the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes/consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons.
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland.
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr. robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike. this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country. in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims.
it is against this background that, all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives. we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum. at this point, we decided to transfer my late
husband's
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used,
lying in the security company.
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents.
if you accept to assist us, do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you.
barrister hope martins law chambers,
e - mail: hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail. fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm.
he would also enlighten you on the sharing (70 %/30 % basis) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust.
regards,
mrs. juliana mbuluku
for: (the family).

Subject: urgent assistance
good day,
i am kingsley muntu, decillion finacial services south africa. this is an urgent and confidential business proposition.
on june 14,2000, a foreign consultant with the global oil corporation,
mr. alan baker made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar
months, valued at us $8,320,000. 00, with us. upon maturity. i sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, a
reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers,
global oil corporation that mr. baker passed away.
on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will
or a testament, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. i also discovered that mr. baker did not declare any kin or
relations in any of his official documents, including his deposit paperwork
in my possession. this has been fixed under our management. no one will ever
come forward to claim it.
consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the beneficiary to this investment. i am writing to you because i
cannot operate a foreign account. i want to present you as the beneficiary
of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney.
please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney
prepares the necessary documents, which will put you in place as the
beneficiary to this investment.
please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this
transaction will be of mutual benefit, as you will be entitled to 30 % of the money and the remaining 70 % for my own investment. if you are
interested, reply me by email for further details.
kind regards,
kingsley muntu.

Subject: (otcbb: itst) up 38 %, uregent news alert
urgent news alert
stock profile
press
release
international telephone services (its) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients.
its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol (south of spain), then extending this to businesses also based in the area.
as of december 1998, when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain, its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality. the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls, prepaid calling cards, and intelligent numbers (90 x, 800 - type).
with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000, its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain. unfortunately, the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot. com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector. by the end of 2001, its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to " ride out the storm. "
by january 2002, actual shareholders, not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time, and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain, decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value.
as of the end of march, its'new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america.
since this time, the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales. these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project.

http:// www. upf. edu/wedelmusic 2004/http:// www. wedelmusic. org/content distribution is presently not anymore limited to music and is becoming more
cross media oriented. new distribution models for old and new content formats are
opening new paths: i - tv, mobile phones, pdas, etc. the development of the internet
technologies introduces strong impact on system architectures and business processes. new national and international regulations, policies and market evolution are
constraining the distribution mechanisms. novel distribution models, development
and application of pervasive computing and multimedia strongly influence this multi -
disciplinary field. the need of content control and monitoring is demanding effective
digital rights management (drm) solutions integrated with sustainable business and
transaction models. these technologies impact on the production and modelling of
cross media content.
wedelmusic - 2004 aims to explore these major topics in cross media field, to address
novel approaches for distributing content to larger audiences, providing wider access
and encouraging broader participation. the impact of these developments on cultural
heritage is also considered, together with their availability to people with limited access to content.

are promoting discussion and interaction among researchers, practitioners, developers,
final users, technology transfer experts, and project managers.

- - formats and models for distribution
- - music manipulation and analysis, transcoding, etc..

- - publishers and distributors servers
- - cross media delivery on multi - channel systems, mobile, i - tv, pdas, internet, etc.
- - automatic cross media content production
- - mpeg - 4, mpeg - 7 and mpeg - 21

3 rd open workshop musicnetwork, munich, march 2004
mpeg ahg on music notation requirements
13-14 of march 2004, munich, germany
http:// www.. org
located at:
technische universit?t m?nchen, germany: http:// www. mpeg - 68. de/location. php
the open workshop of musicnetwork is at its third edition. the modeling ofmusic
notation/representation is a complex problem. music representation can be used
for several different purposes: entertainment, music education, infotainment,
music archiving and retrieval, music querying, music production, music profiling,
etc. in the current internet and multimedia age many other applications are
strongly getting the market attention and most of them will become more diffuse
of the present applications in short time. end users have discovered the multimedia
experience, and thus, the traditional music models are going to be replaced by
their integration with multimedia, audio visual, cross media. at present, there is
a lack of music notation/representation standard integrated with multimedia. the
aim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at standardizing a music
notation/representation model and decoder integrated into the mpeg environment,
that presently can be regarded as the most active and powerful set of standard
formats for multimedia consumers.
the topics of the workshop are related mainly focused on:
- - music notation/representation requirements
- - music protection and distribution
- - music description and its usage on archive query
please contribute with your work on the above topics, for details see the www site
of the workshop.
the access is be free of charge, supported by the european commission.

Subject: urgent message
mr francis oma
attn: director/ceo,
a cry for family help.
i am mr francis oma the first son of the late mr. peter oma. my father had served mr b. h. lions who was an irish citizen and a successful farmer in our remote village. my father served him for many years and inherited his farm after his death. my father became an executive member of the farmers association in the western mashonaland province of zimbabwe. he also became a successful businessman, because of the recent uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing, my father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and i move to south africa to escape the violence.
we left zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of us $11. 5 m (eleven million, five hundred thousand united states dollars only) and valuables (diamonds) worth us $5 m. my father has instructed us to deposit it with a private security company on our arrival.
he also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone for security reasons and all the documents pertaining to this deposition.
barely two months after we moved to johannesburg, we got information that my father's farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his workers had been killed. my father's property and farmland have now been taken over by the war veterans.
i believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my father because of white owned farms. we could not even attend the funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives. our reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund. have in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality for the transfer. your participation gives you 20 % of the total sum, 7 % for all expense in curred during this business while 73 % is for my younger brother and i. the diamond will be discussed at our arrival.
we do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we will also need your assistance in this regard. we have agreed to give you a share of the money if you are willing to assit us, should this proposal meet your utmost consideration, please do not hesitate to contact my brother or me on the above email address.
the confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention it demands. please treat this proposal with the utmost regard, and the confidentiality of these business should not be over - emphasised.
please response on this email address; francisoma @ zwallet. com
waiting for your favourable response.
thanks and god bless,
(from mr francis oma).

Subject: god bless you
dr. nkem george.
bank of the north,
victoria island branch,
lagos, nigeria.
my dear friend,
i am dr. nkem george., branch manager with bank of
the north, victoria island branch, lagos, nigeria.
i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled with
extreme confidentiality.
on january 6,1999 a foreign oil consultant and
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum
corporation (nnpc) mr. james herbert by name made a
numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months
valued at us $38. 6 m (thirty eight million, six hundred
united states dollars only) in my branch.
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in
accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply.
after a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian
national petroleum corporation (nnpc) that mr. james
herbert died from an automobile accident.
on further investigation, we found out that he died
without making a will and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was fruitless. i therefore made further
investigations and discovered that mr. james herbert
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all
his official documents including his bank deposit
paperwork in my bank.
this sum of us $38. 6 m has been carefully moved out of
my bank to a security company in europe for
safekeeping.
no one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to nigerian law, at the expiration of 5 and
half years the money will revert to the ownership of the
nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the
fund.
this prompted us to contact you. we will like to front
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $38. 6
million u. s dollars that is presently in a security
company in europe.
i contacted you because it is against our code of
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the
security company in europe.
we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum
would be for you if you agree to take part in this
profitable transaction, 70 % for me and 2 of my
colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay
back the expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction by both parties after the
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account.
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction, the following information would be needed
from you to expedite action.
1) your full name and address that would be used to
establish you as the next of kin of our late client
thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund.
this would ensure that the security company in europe
releases the consignment/fund to you.
2) your private mobile, telphone and fax numbers where
you can be reached at all time because this
transaction entails constant communication.
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of
the transaction.
if you are interested, send the requested information
via email
i await your response urgently.
regards,
dr. nkem george..

sergio hoffmann, 25 y. o. psychotherapist, germany:
i think i'm younkger than main target group of cialdis consumers, but i
have a very hard work, i always had to listen about people's failures, about bad life et cetera.
all that problems affected my selxual activity, my wife was not as happy as before with me.
i tried viagras - both genedric and pfdizer's, but they does not act as good and as long as i want it to be.
finally, my colleague told me about cialdis and i ordered it. the results were really better, trust a doctor.
i'd recommend it to anybody with erectlion troubles.
p. s.: by the way, you can mix cialis with alcohol without any harm!

from: the desk of mr. igho kadiri
union bank of nigeria plc
lagos nigeria
big, strong, reliable.
dear sir,
i know this proposal will come to you as a surprise
expecially when you do not know the writer,
condsidering, the huge sum of money involved which could make any
apprehensive.
let me start by introducing myself to you, i am mr. igho kadiri director credit control, union bank of nigeria plc. lagos. i saw your contact during my private search at the information centre here in nigeria chamber of commence and industry and i want to believe that you
will be very honest, committed and capable of assisting in this business venture.
firstly, let me explain the source of this funds and what you are expected to do. a forigner late engineer theophilus baker, an oil merchant/contractor with the government of nigeria, until his death, over a year ago, was a victim ofa kenya airways: bus (a 310-300) flight
kq 430 plane crash. the deceased, engnieer theopilius baker, banked with us and has a closing balance as a july 2000 worth $4. 5 m (four million five hundred thosand usd). which my bank, now expectes a next - of - kin
to claim as the beneficiary of the funds, efforts has been made by union bank of nigeria to get in touch with the baker's family or relative but to no success.
based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate engnieer theopilus's next - of - kin, the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown
account.
it is based on this that we have contacted you to stand as the next - of - kin of late engr. theopilus baker so that the funds, will be released and paid into your account
as the beneficiary and the next - of - kin to the deceased. all documents, and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as we have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account. it has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 20 % of the remitted funds, while we keep 75 % and 5 % will be set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes.
if this proposal satisfies you, please reach us only by mail, for more information.
yours faithfully,
mr. igho kadiri.
nb: for confidential reason and security purpose, we will be communicating thruogh email for now.

Subject: record sales, profits, earnings, stock price and trading for leth jylra
market mover stock report's last pick (cwtd) exploded from $1. 19 to
$9. 20, a gain of over 670 % in 5 days (feb 12-17)!!!
here is our next hot pick which we feel is the most undervalued stock
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year based
on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 million), incredibly solid
numbers, and low outstanding share total.
life energy and technology holdings, inc.
(otcbb: leth)
current price: 2. 45
near - term target: 7. 00
projected high for'04: 15. 00
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!
sales orders received by leth exceed $150 million over the past year
while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom
line. leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into
electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand that it is
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.
(mar 9'04) urgent news update:
leth announces the sale of two (2) biosphere process systems to
procura international limited for $14 million with an option for the sale of
an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months.
solving a dual crisis - waste and energy:
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere
process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of
waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the
global waste problem. this profitable and environmentally safe process
converts into clean, green electricity such waste materials as municipal
solid waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of
used tires. leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.
(mar 3'04) leth release major product delivery and net profit news
leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit
of $3. 5 million, the equivalent of. 12 cents per share. leth is scheduled to
receive an additional $7 million translating into an additional. 24 cents per
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months.
the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock
above $6 by calculating the. 36 cents per share total at an average industry
pe of 18-22.
examining leth - by the numbers
total assets: 36. 8 million = 1. 26 per share of assets
cash: 23. 4 million =. 80 cents per share of cash
shares outstanding: 29 million (down from 31. 8 million) after 2. 8 million
shares retired in feb.'04
additional shares to be retired: 1. 3 million per company press release
estimated shares in float: 7 million
completed biosphere process systems now in operation: 26
record backlog of sales for leth:
during the past year, over 20 additional biosphere process systems have
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over
$100 million in upcoming sales. many of these contractual agreements
include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the
future once the initial order has been completed. the options vary from
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this
low - float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 million
per biosphere process system!
leth's blue chip partner - fortifying the system:
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech, inc. (nasdaq: ttek, $20) a
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and
electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government
with annual sales of $800 million. tetra tech will coordinate the securing of
necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the
biosphere process system for leth. tetra tech is now in the process of
obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the
biosphere process in the state of louisiana. this is a monumental event for
leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana
while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -
term announcement.
stock set to explode on earnings boom:
leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to
achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company's
breakout year. the added kicker is that leth has historically released
batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. we feel that pattern is
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very
big surprises still to come. there aren't any companies at any price level
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth, while
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global
demand to solve two crisis areas, waste and electrical energy, reaches
unprecedented levels.

re: transfer of (usd 26 million)
i want to transfer to overseas ($26,000. 000. 00 usd) twenty six million united states dollars) from ecobank, benin. i have the courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important and confidential business to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this funds quitely.
i am dr kenneth okoh the accountant/auditor in ecobank, benin and personal confidant to dr. ravindra f. shah who died together with his wife dr. mrs. manjula parikh - shah in a planecrash on the lst oct. 2003 on their way to attend a wedding in boston.
mr. ravindra f. shah, is an american, a physician and industrialist, he died last year without having any beneficiary to his assets including his account herein benin which he opened in a eco bank, benin in the year 2000 as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his company before his untimely death in 2003. the amount involved is (usd
26,000. 000. 00 usd) twenty six million united states dollars and no other person knows about this account. i am contacting you for me to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary, i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a/c mr. ravindra f. shah is a foreigner too, and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.
however, i am revealing this to you with belief in god that you will never let me down in this business. you are the first and the only person that i am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that i will inform you the next step to take urgently. send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the transfer. i need your full co - operation to make this work because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which i will give to you, upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business.
at the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40 % of the total amount, 60 % will be for me. i look forward to your earliest reply through
my email or you call me on phone.
yours'faithfully,
dr kenneth okoh

market watch news flash
explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue (ticker: srge) are being predicted as many
significant news releases indicate strong contractual
revenues with major telecom firms.
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4
years, but is now projecting a banner expansion year with
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands
for their innovative patented products and expansion into
international telecom markets.
surge technologies, inc. (srge) is a cutting - edge leader
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior
patented outside plant electrical surge protection
equipment for the telecommunications industry.
the us sales projections for this market are $4 billion
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate
the industry.
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest
quality protection element for complex digital switches.
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time.
major telecoms require this protection throughout their
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive
system failures.

how many times have you seen issues explode but you
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right
information in time? we are alerting you now to a special
company with a unique technology that is on the forefront
of a breakout! we are excited about srge's technology
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with
major us telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. srge has made phenomenal
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued,
therefore a 300 % - 400 % jump may wind up being conservative.

landon had made an unsuccessful attempt at the recitation, and the doctor,
somewhat nettled, said: landon, you don't seem to be getting on very fast in
this subject. you seem to lack ambition. why, at your age alexander the
great had conquered half the world. yes, said landon, he couldn't help it,
for you will recall the fact, doctor, that alexander the great had aristotle
for a teacher.
on the first day of college, the dean addressed the students, pointing out
some of the rules: the female dormitory will be out - of - bounds for all male
students, and the male dormitory to the female students. anybody caught
breaking this rule will be fined $20 the first time. he continued: anybody
caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. being caught a
third time will incur a hefty fine of $180. are there any questions?!!!! at
this point, a male student in the crowd inquired: how much for a season
pass?

Subject: market watch undervalued report f
april 2004 top pick of the month
life energy and technology holdings, inc.
(otcbb: leth)
leth receives $250,000,000 in financing to fund the manufacture
of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system
waste - to - energy units in the united states.
first unit to roll - out in new orleans in early second quarter.
we are expecting earth - shattering upcoming news leading a strong
rally in leth for a company that has announced over $100 million
in sales orders in the past year, and tops that record - setting
achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $8. 62 per share in
cash for major worldwide expansion.
* * our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick * *
ushg featured at. 75
reached 3. 65 in 8 days!
traded as high as 7. 00 since!
the biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand:
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. this
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean,
green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste,
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge
market of used tires. leth profits from the sale of electricity
created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating
5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to
replenish the local or national grid.
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need
for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding
universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste.
leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a
major push for generating electricity from alternative sources
continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power
failures.
financing of $250 million positions leth for astronomical sales:
the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the
fact that this $1. 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to
$8. 62 per common share in cash. there are 26 biosphere process
systems presently in operation worldwide. the available funding
could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres. now factor
in that the average sale price is $7 million per biosphere. we
cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with
a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million shares
outstanding!
leth stock guidance:
current price: 1. 80
near - term target: 4. 80
projected high for'04: 12. 50
leth's blue chip partner - fortifying the system:
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech, inc. (nasdaq: ttek, $21)
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical,
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us
government with annual sales of $800 million. tetra tech will
coordinate the securing of necessary permits, installation, and
continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system
for leth. tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department
of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in
the state of louisiana. this is a monumental event for leth which
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while
having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge
near - term announcement.
political power fosters rapid global expansion:
leth has captured the profit - making attention of both us and
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity
from alternative sources. this has been accomplished by successfully
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the
political contacts at the highest level from dr. albert reynolds,
chairman of leth, who is also the former prime minister of ireland.
dr. reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding
leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value
to the size of the market.
uncommon value for a company of this caliber:
we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere,
the impressive backlog of over $100 million in sales orders, and
the company's very solid financial position. we view this perfectly
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company's
own sales records. as our top stock pick for april, we anticipate
the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite leth shares which carry our highest rating for short - term
trading profits followed by robust long - term capital gains.

Subject: reply soon!!!
dear sir,
i know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the
only secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business.
it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and
assistance in the context stated below: may i first introduce my self: i am
dr. (mrs.) mariam abacha, the wife of late general sani abacha (former
military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria)
who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998. i got your contact on the internet as
i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children,
hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.
i have lost confidence with anybody within the country.
having noted the confidence reposed on your person,
i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving
the sum of us $20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general
(my husband).
this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have
all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for
safe keeping. this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to
avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.
it is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my
organisation family support program (f. s. p). i will enlighten you more of this
organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.
on your acceptance to render this assistance to me
to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a
conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for
non - speculative investments in your country. however, the current civilian
administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo (the president of the
federal republic of nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family
because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late
husband while in office. in pursuit of this vendetta, the present government have
resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including
properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the
various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland, uk, australia. in fact,
the attack on our family (the abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of
seizing our travelling passport, family accounts and even trying some members of our
family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband.
in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival, our
family trustee have secretly protected the will, the security company has
called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the
demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very
soon. but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas
amount, hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come
to my full assistance and unlimited
co - operation. in the meantime, there is a travelling embargo on us (the whole
family members) and our local accounts are seized. we are currently living
on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the
sins
of my late husband. in view of this plight, i expect you to be trustworthy
and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my
children from a hopeless future. and if you agree to help, we will
compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of
the total amount of $20 million us dollars.
in that case, when the money ($20 million) is moved into your
discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in
your favour, while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur
(there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by
you.) during the process of securing this consignment. the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my
children's future. my cousin (dr. yemi musa) has perfected arrangements with
the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe
operation. what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance
company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide
owner. and in due course, all contacts must be made through
dr yemi musa through this e - mail: address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice. com and
phone: 00221 512 48 59. senegal.
i look forward to your quick response while thanking
you for your co - operation. in view of all above
details, i request you to keep this letter and
co - operation highly confidential.
best wishes,
mrs. mariam abacha.
