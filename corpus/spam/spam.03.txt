if you receive a vast amount of bulk
email then please read on. this email was sent to you so you may stop unwanted
emails from entering your inbox. let me tell you a little bit about myself
and why i am imposing on your valuable time. my name is rich and i have
been selling products on the internet for years. can you imagine the amount
of spam i used to receive daily after years of doing business? let me tell
you it was overwhelming to say the least. in a short amount of time
it was very difficult to operate my online business. my inboxes were filled with
advertisements for every product and get rich quick scheme out there. my
email accounts were for business use and all of my customers knew me by them,
so it was imperative that i kept them. i was determined to stop my in - boxes from
getting cluttered every day. i tried every method possible to keep my in - boxes
clean but it was getting worse by the month. after spending hundreds of dollars
on spam blockers and countless hours i finally found the perfect solution. it
is called email box filter. email box filter was a lifesaver for me. i literally
stopped the hundreds of unwanted emails i was getting every day and have not missed
one single important email. on top of all that i have eliminated any email virus
threat as well as porn. here is

gilford, n. h., dec 20,2004/prnewswire - firstcall via comtex/- - istorage networks, inc. (pink sheets: iogn) announced today that it has been issued purchase orders valued at $90,000 (ninety thousand usd) for its network storage products.
about istorage networks:
istorage networks, inc. develops and markets network storage solutions that are specifically designed for the small to medium business. computer activity has obviously grown over the last few years, especially driven by electronic mail (e - mail). this demand is further propagated by digital photos, video files and new high image applications. federal requirements for audit trails, medical records and as well as security, add to this acceleration for the need of network storage capacity. istorage with its expertise and experience in the worldwide storage industry, coupled with its technology and channel partners, can deliver products that are simple to use and affordable to meet these needs.
istorage products utilize a new and emerging technology called iscsi. iscsi, is an ip (internet protocol) based standard for linking data storage devices over a network and transferring the users data. from the storage side, iscsi uses the scsi command set, the core storage commands used throughout all storage configurations. on the networking side, iscsi uses ip and ethernet, which are the basis for most corporate networks. this revolutionary technology utilizes a standard disk drive interface and internet communications techniques, and provides an easy method for user's to manage data.
the purchase orders have been issued through the company's international resellers for projects in the automotive manufacturing and petrochemical refinery industry. these orders are the result of our efforts to date in developing the worldwide sales channel for our product offerings, said roger kirkland, vp sales and marketing for istorage. he also added the company is well positioned to support the growing marketplace in the small to medium business sector. these orders are for immediate shipment

minnesota, which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st. louis this weekend, appeared on
its way to retaking the lead. but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning.
the vikings (8-7), though, couldn't
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season.
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed.
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt, one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured, military
sources said.
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble.
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night.
the attack " indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization, it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations, " gissin told a news crew. " and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority. "
shortly after the first blast, a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza, but its precise location was not
immediately known.
hamas, in a phone call to cnn, said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks.
there was no immediate information
available on that group, although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat.
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack, with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated.
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties.
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded.
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack, hamas said it had used 1. 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident.
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt. israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling. shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning, wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren,
palestinian medical and security sources said.
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries, the sources said.

in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby.
in response, the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons, but did not fire a tank shell, the military
sources said.

we've had our eye on match point for almost one year now. consolidation

attract a fortune 50 o as a potential source of even greater, and as of
yet, untapped revenue. mcallister expects the deal to be consummated in

event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into
acquisition negotiations.
both local delray beach - based companies could integrate the two
entities. basica | | y we're both from the same industry, and together i believe
we couid be bigger and accomplish more than as stand - aione companies,
said robert mcaliister, ceo president of mi | | ennium national events.
mark baron, president of match point, inc., says of the negotiations,
we are considering miliennium's offers and believe that there could be
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders.
mca | | ister also feeis the purchase of match point is a good move for
both miilennium sharehoiders and match point. this acquisition is
consistent with our overa | | business pian. it has aiways been our intent to
target and acquire successfu |, high - profile events and their promoters;
we've had our eye on match point for almost one year now. consolidation
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of
each individua | event.
exact terms have been not yet been announced, but miliennium sees the
match point acquisition ultimately being abie to bring net revenues to
mnei's bottom | ine.
mnei sees both the internationa | teievision audience and the abiiity to
attract a fortune 5 oo as a potentia | source of even greater, and as of
yet, untapped revenue. mcaliister expects the dea | to be consummated in
this quarter.
the atp tournament is being held jan. 31 - feb. 6 at the deiray beach
tennis center. the draw for the 13 th annual miilennium itc includes top
americans vince spadea, currently no. 19 in the worid, two - time itc
champion jan - michae | gambiil and james blake. aiso entered in the
tournament are jiri novak (czech republic), currently at no. 25, two - time
millennium itc finalist xavier maiisse (belgium) and defending champion
ricardo me | | o (brazil). the tournament sti | | hoids two wildcards that can
be offered to other top piayers in the weeks leading up to the event.

Subject: subscribers receive first notice on run - away stocks
traders'monthly alert
january pick (bmxg) exploded from. 20 to 2. 07,
a gain of over 900 % in 6 days (1/18-1/24)!
our next pick is an incredible find that will
outperform all others based on their solid
numbers, huge sales backlog, $2 billion in
financing, low outstanding shares, and a deal
with chinese government - run companies totaling
$10 billion!
urgent buy at any price:
global environmental energy corp.
otcbb - geec
current price - 1. 90
running to - 6. 00
geec is cbs marketwatch. com's # 1 best performer in the dj
diversified industrials index in the last 2 months. this
is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m, ge,
and honeywell.
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!
geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. this is a sign of
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy,
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible
to assign a value to the size of the market.
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major
impact on the global waste problem. this profitable and
environmentally safe process converts into clean, green
electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste,
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes,
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural
gas, and the huge market of used tires.
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is
then sold to replenish the local or national grid.
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide
need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the
disposal of waste. geec has secured international acceptance
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact
the global waste problem while a major push for generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.
geec just announced a $10 billion, 5 - year joint venture with
chinese government - operated companies, including yanzhou coal
mining (nyse - yzc, $74). the deal is structured to have 1,300
geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation, two
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1. 3
billion people. as china's rapid economic advance continues,
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually, prompting
periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces. geec is in line
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable
municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china
meet its energy needs.
the forecast for geec is crystal clear, and this is just the tip
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares
should be added immediately to every portfolio. we expect a
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still
represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber. look
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite geec, which earns our highest rating for the most
explosive gains on wall street.

Subject: did you notice?
never agaln
minnesota, which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st. louis this weekend, appeared on
its way to retaking the lead. but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning.
the vikings (8-7), though, couldn't
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season.
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed.
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt, one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured, military
sources said.
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble.
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night.
the attack " indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization, it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations, " gissin told a news crew. " and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority. "
shortly after the first blast, a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza, but its precise location was not
immediately known.
hamas, in a phone call to cnn, said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks.
there was no immediate information
available on that group, although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat.
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack, with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated.
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties.
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded.
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack, hamas said it had used 1. 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident.
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt. israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling. shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning, wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren,
palestinian medical and security sources said.
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries, the sources said.
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby.
in response, the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons, but did not fire a tank shell, the military
sources said.

i was skeptical when i ordered your product.
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything. on april 17 th
at 12: 00 pm, i finished my last cigarette in my last pack. after taking the first 2 pills,
i have not touched another cigarette. on march 15,1991 i turned 35 years old.
6 days later i had a severe heart attack. after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again. i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away.
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i'd be dead and gone.
but now i feel alive again. more energy and even happier than i have been in years.
and i owe it all to you and your great product. you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you. thank you. - ronnie davenport oklahoma city, ok
exactly what i needed... this is a great system! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn't know just how many or what kind there were!
the final smoke capsules were the best. every time i lit up a cigarette,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked, usually only 2-3 puffs.
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons!
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop! i've been trying
to quit for the past 7 years, i tried everything under the sun with no results.
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month! - e. okamura, hawaii

oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers
which is followed by soaring undervalued otc oi | plays. widespread
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfolios of aggressive otc
investors. due to recentiy acquired high - potential oi | and gas projects,
eogi is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production
revenue and becoming a cash - fiow positive leader in major oil - producing
states.
eogi's high - yieiding, muitiple driiling programs have been solidified
through valuabie strategic a | | iances. these expioration partnerships
enable the company to accumuiate substantia | working interests being
deveioped into a continuously expanding revenue stream. eogi is focused on
joint - ventures invoiving well re - entry programs in extremely prolific
production areas using the highest | evel of technology currently
avaiiabie.
recent deveiopments for eogi have been perfectiy timed as al | 6 dow
jones oi | and gas indexes just hit their highest levels of the year, with
energy stocks outperforming all other market sectors. the company's oi |
and gas interests in louisiana and texas, in addition to their
deveioping natural gas wells in aiberta, canada, are continuing to in crease in
value with energy prices up 60 % from one year ago. leading economists
and oi | analysts agree on predictions that a further 3 o - 60 % in crease is
likeiy next year.
we are expecting eogi to reiease major news announcements regarding
production figures on muitipie projects in high - gear. eogi's expansion
plans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can
oniy add to their growing bottom - line and spark further interest in
this undervaiued oil play. with a very smal | float estimated at less than

qult
minnesota, which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st. louis this weekend, appeared on
its way to retaking the lead. but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning.
the vikings (8-7), though, couldn't
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season.
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed.
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt, one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured, military
sources said.
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble.
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night.
the attack " indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization, it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations, " gissin told a news crew. " and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority. "
shortly after the first blast, a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza, but its precise location was not
immediately known.
hamas, in a phone call to cnn, said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks.
there was no immediate information
available on that group, although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat.
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack, with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated.
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties.
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded.
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack, hamas said it had used 1. 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident.
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt. israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling. shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning, wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren,
palestinian medical and security sources said.
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries, the sources said.
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby.
in response, the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons, but did not fire a tank shell, the military
sources said.

readers who have
followed oil stock recommendations (otcbb: svse and asurf) in the past have
profited nicely. the company tradestar corp. (otc: tirr), is a junior
oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset
drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have " the largest untapped
potential for natural gas in north america. " new prices and technologies have
exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over
90 %. tradestar corp. is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil
and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south
of ft worth. the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in
economical drilling, completion and production techniques, have resulted in:
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease
values in this extremely productive area.
2 co - mingling gas flow from
several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total
output.
3 the opportunity to drill new offset
wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 %. (using oil @ $35. 00 and gas
@ $4. 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6
months. oil is currently $48 and gas $6!!!!
tirr's strategy is to strike oil again!
using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to
tap into low risk, high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most
prolific plays (barnett shale in central texas) in the lower 48 states!!!
withabalanced portfolioofoilgas
properties, an aggressive acquisition campaign,
experienced management team, and application of cutting edge
ep technologies, we believe that
tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment
portfolio.
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a
company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy
prices. these high energy prices have created new opportunities to
bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk
to the company!!!!

Subject: investment news: hot stock this week! "
the u. s. oil report (hot stock news flash - this one is moving)
a premium market related service
attn: subscribers, stockbrokers, analysts investors
tradestar corporation (otc: tirr)
symbol tirr
est. shares outstanding 38,000,000
est. float 2,000,000
recent price $0. 71
tirr is up over 70 % in the past two weeks!!!
tradestar corporation (tirr) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing on 35 bpd in production!!!
readers who have followed oil stock recommendations (otcbb: svse and asurf) in the past have profited nicely.
the company
tradestar corp. (otc: tirr), is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america. new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over 90 %. tradestar corp. is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth. the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling, completion and production techniques, have resulted in:
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area.
2 co - mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total output.
3 the opportunity to drill new offset wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 %. (using oil @ $35. 00 and gas @ $4. 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months. oil is currently $48 and gas $6!!!!
tirr's strategy is to strike oil again! using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk, high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays (barnett shale in central texas) in the lower 48 states!!! with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties, an aggressive acquisition campaign, experienced management team, and application of cutting edge ep technologies, we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio.
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy prices. these high energy prices have created new opportunities to bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk to the company!!!!
previous news
tradestar corporation announces barnett shale project
hot springs, ark., - - tradestar (otc: tirr) today announces that it has entered into a joint venture agreement with united production and exploration of houston, texas to reenter and drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county, texas. in addition to the gas well reentry, the prospect, which covers 111 acres, has an additional location to drill a new well. the objective formation of the recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of approximately 4,830'to 5,030'with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone. estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750,000 mcf for each well.
why we love this stock
1. continued rise in world oil gas prices!
2. over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific barnett shale of central texas
3. strong industry investment banking relationships
4. strong management - over 50 years of experience in the oil patch
5. multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners
6. tight float, low entry price strong upward potential!
7. business model offers only real solution to u. s. dependency on foreign oil.
8. the company recently proposed a joint venture project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with est. reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas!
conclusion
tradestar corp. (tirr) is getting ready to become a major presence in oil gas fields across texas. tirr's potential for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the barnett shale, position the stock for immediate upward movement!!! we believe that tirr is in position to take the petroleum industry by storm. the company's resource development is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in the near future. revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last year. don't miss this fantastic opportunity. for more information on tirr, go to tradestar - corp. com for sec filings or press releases.
this is one of our top recommendations this year. we are giving tirr our seal of approval.

editor of resource opportunities newsletter, is one of the few editors we
follow who is a geologist. we find his copy more conservative than most, and
respect his researched opinion. his recent profile of elgin resources (elr: tsx), a platinum
company, was important for us to read, because we know he followed aquarius
platinum earlier. aquarius is a highly successful company on the london stock exchange. thank you lawrence for allowing us to share your knowledge of

elgin
resources
(elr - tsx)
extracted from the march 2005-1 issue
elgin
is in the process of merging with jonpol to create a company with substantial
platinum interests and near - term production potential.
the combined company will have in excess of 12 million
ounces of platinum group metals to its credit, all in the measured and
indicated resource category. most importantly, both of the main deposits that
will initially be held by the new company are presently headed toward early
development.
both of elgins projects are on the eastern limb of
the bushveld complex in south africa. the bushveld is the worlds most
important source of platinum, producing two thirds of the world's supply of the
precious metal.
the elgin deposits have grades and other attributes
comparable to nearby profitable operating mines. they have the added benefit of
being located at a shallow depth, with plans to begin mining one of the
deposits as an open pit. by taking advantage of nearby infrastructure, elgin can develop the mines quickly and at modest capital costs.

breaking news!!
april 29, - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its
sylvan lake project. after several delays due to unseasonable weather and
road closures in the province of alberta, the contracted drilling rig
was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5-3 - 38-3 w 5 m
well. the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well
immediately there after.
the company's west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban.
with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and
gas has prepared a detailed project description.
project history
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950's and
has produced over 40 million barrels (mbbls) of high quality crude oil
and 50 billion cubic feet (bcf) of associated natural gas,
predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations. the field
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics.
the original freehold lease on section 3-38-3 w 5 m was leased to a major
oil company, as was most of the sylvan lake field itself. an
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7-3 - 38-3 w 5 m in 1958 and was
abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely
eroded by post depositional cutting. as a consequence, the major company
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the
deeper mineral rights (below the base of the jurassic formations) on the
west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in
the early 1960's. this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more
specifically, not often by the major companies. accordingly, these mineral
rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000's as almost all oil
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee.
through diligent land work (including field visits) our partners discovered
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3. since
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres
(one quarter section) of section 3. energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %
of this prospect (possibly 75 %) with the drilling of a test well in
5-3 - 38-3 w 5 m.
land discussion
our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and
northeast quarter of section 3-38-3 w 5 m. the land comprises some 480
acres (one section or one square mile equals 640 acres). primary drilling
spacing in alberta is as follows; one quarter section spacing (160
acres) for oil and one section spacing (640 acres) for natural gas. the
province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units
(called holdings) should you be able to prove to the province's
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased
well density. almost the entire sylvan lake field, pekisko pool, has
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering
pekisko oil we will down space as well.
geological discussion
pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and
associated gas production from the deeper (older) pekisko formation. the
sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the
pekisko formation. this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions. overlying
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks (impermeable layers) of the
mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous/jurassic impermeable
shales. these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and
account for billions of barrels of reserves.
production facilities discussion
this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas
over the past forty - five years. accordingly a multitude of gas gathering
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
constructed.
a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed
drilling location. the capacity of the processing facility is
approximately 70 mmcf/d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf/d. accordingly,
excess capacity of 24 mmcf/d exists in the facility which would be in
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible.
this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of
red deer, alberta. accordingly, trucking costs would be minimal to get
oil product to the transportation system.
for more detailed project description please see news release dated
(fri, apr 29).
