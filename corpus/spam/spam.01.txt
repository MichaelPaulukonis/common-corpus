biel first fda cleared product, actipatch (tm) therapy is a dermal
patch with an embedded microchip that delivers weeks of continuous pulsed
electromagnetic energy. actipatch therapy is the miniaturized
equivalent of the large pulsed electromagnetic energy machines prescribed by
physicians for decades to reduce swelling, relieve pain and enhance the
healing of surgical incisions, accidental wounds, sprains, strains and
chronic wounds (bedsores). actipatch's size, portability, ease of use
and relatively low price overcomes the obstacles to use associated with the
large, expensive, stationary machines. the introduction of actipatch
provides an immediate therapeutic alternative for the 200 million surgical
and non - surgical soft tissue injuries across the u. s. annually.
bioelectronics has launched it's actipatch product line in cooperative
distribution relationships with several well - established medical device
companies in various medical market segments.

sergio hoffmann, 25 y. o. psychotherapist, germany:
i think i'm younkger than main target group of cialdis consumers, but i
have a very hard work, i always had to listen about people's failures, about bad life et cetera.
all that problems affected my selxual activity, my wife was not as happy as before with me.
i tried viagras - both genedric and pfdizer's, but they does not act as good and as long as i want it to be.
finally, my colleague told me about cialdis and i ordered it. the results were really better, trust a doctor.
i'd recommend it to anybody with erectlion troubles.
p. s.: by the way, you can mix cialis with alcohol without any harm!

contract awarded and executed on behalf of my ministry the federal ministry of works
and housing. the contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to
the tune of us $60,000,000. 00 (sixty million united states dollars). but in the course
of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a bulgarian contractor at the cost of
us $43,500,000. 00 (forty - three million, five hundred thousand united states dollars) to
my benefit unknown to the contractor.

of contractual claims alongside that of the bulgarian contractor, to enable me
transfer the difference of us $16,500,000. 00 (sixteen million, five hundred thousand
united states dollars) into your providedaccount.
on actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below:
1. 20 % of the fund will be for you as beneficiary
2. 10 % for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be
incurred during the course of the transaction.
3. 70 % of the fund will be for me which i intend to invest in real estate business
your country with you as my partner. all logistics are in place and all modalities
worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working

investor financial times report
specializing in undervalued small cap stocks for immediate breakout
erhc and exxon mobil exercise priority rights on highly sought after oil
blocks in nigeria and sao tome's joint development zone (jdz) in the
gulf of guinea.
every major news wire service worldwide has carried hundreds of articles
revealing that the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10 to 15
billion barrels of oil. the jdz line - up tipped to take over upcoming
blocks includes exxon mobil, erhc, chevron texaco, amerada hess,
and anadarko.
license approval for the region's exclusive economic zone (eez) is a
multilateral deal securing blocks jointly involving exxon mobil, erhc,
and chevron texaco.
erhc has jumped from a. 25 cent stock earlier in the year to a. 50 cent
stock that is headed for over $2 or a possible buyout from one of their
jdz multinational players.
erhc has been at the negotiating tables with the super - major oil
companies. it is impossible to measure the power that is carried where a
stock at this price level is a vital part of a key union of oil giants!
the top - level executives of the jdz oil majors have been finalizing the
percentage awards with erhc for official announcement of the
landmark - licensing round in the first 2 weeks of june.
the us government is pushing for increasing development of the area to
minimize middle east dependence. the eyes of the world are watching with
record prices at the pump and oil busting through $40 per barrel.
the oil companies will always make their $billions - investors can cash
in by accumulating a substantial position just before earth - shattering
news is released that will send shock waves through erhc.

this one appears tame, smith said,
but could be dangerous because wild animals are unpredictable. people should not
approach it, nor should they run away from the animal since that could provoke a
chase. the best thing to do is ignore it, keep away from it and call the
authorities, he g to tales circulating the wooded neighborhood off, the animal
walked up to a man as he was swinging his toddler in the back yard. the cat is
said to have lunged at the child. as the story goes, the man fended it off with
a chair, his wife grabbed their child, and they ran into the house. the cat sat
on their back deck for a while looking in, just like at the in another tale on a
different street, a teenage baby sitter was at the backyard pool with an
8 - year - old boy and his cousin. the cat sneaked up on them from behind, and she
jumped into the pool with the boy. they swam to the other side, but it followed
them. they all ran into the house, and the cat sat looking in the door.

i'll keep it short and sweet.
to get started just right mouse click and copy this whole page and paste it
in an
e - mail to edit it.
once i got started the money started rolling in!!! just like the plan below
said it would!
i am currently getting over � 200 a day and just started
weekago!!!!!
believe it or not, this is my 2 nd time around. simply follow the
instructions below and in 2 to 3 weeks, you will have at least � 20,000 in
your
paypal account.
most people respond to this program because of the low investment (� 5) and
high profit potential. the return rate is currently 50 % to 80 %. there is no
limit
to the income you can generate from this business (you can do it over and
over). this program is the fastest, easiest program you will ever do.
the only down fall is when people try to put their address in the # 1 place.
if
they do that they will only reach the people they initially send to, and
only
make a few pounds.
if you follow the instructions you will reach thousands of people! honesty,
faith and integrity make this system work.
team work makes the dream work! lets get started!
i think everyone has heard of " paypal " (if not you will). paypal (owned by
ebay) is the simplest method of making and receiving payments online. anyone
with
an email address can join for free! if you're not already a paypal user, the
first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up for free:
use the link above to sign up for a free account, then send a � 5. 00 donation
from
your paypal account (you will earn back � 5. 00 from paypal, for signing up
anyway!) to only the first email address on the list along with a note
saying: " please add me to your mailing list ".
now send an email to the 4 th person on the list saying " thanks i've joined ".
then, remove the first email address and place your address at the bottom.
this
should move the second place into the first place and the third place into
second and fourth into the third.
don't try to place yourself in the first place.
it will only reach the people you send it to, and then your name will be
removed from the lst place by that person and this will not make the system
work.
if you do this the way it was designed it will reach thousands by the time
your name gets to the top. remember to only send a � 5. 00 donation to the
first
e - mail address, and send " thanks i've joined " to the fourth person. this
lets the
4 th person keep track of their progress.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
1. siberiantigergrowl @ hotmail. com
2. jemimajones _ 7 @ hotmail. com
3. @ hotmail. com
4. nic @ madstock. freeserve. co. uk
now that you have made your donation to the first person and sent the fourth
person a note, place your email address in the fourth place (make sure its
the
same email address you used for your paypal account) this is the way you
will
receive payment.
ok, the only thing left to do is email out at least 20 copies or more (!) of
this
letter in a week or so. when your name reaches the top of the list it will
be
your turn to collect your money from 2,000 to 3,000 people just like
yourself
who are willing to spend � 5. 00 and half an hour of there time to receive
� 20,000
in cash! keep in mind... the most you've spent is � 5.
testimonials: d. rayner london: i only have one thing to say to
you.... oh my god! i sent out 40 copies like the instructions said and left on
holiday. when i got back my account had over � 12,000 in it already! i'm
still
floating on air (especially with my new car i bought!)!
thanks!
this programe works, it really does.
so good luck to the rest of you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

dear citibank customer,

there was attempts to compromise it with brute forcing your pin number.

attempts may have been initiated by you.
the login attempt was made from:

Subject: personal contact
dear sir/madam,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. the purpose of my mail is that i am mr. peter stevens, the second son of dr. dennis stevens, who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe. i am writing from holland (the netherlands) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker.
before the death of my father, he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of (us $18. 9 m) eighteen million, nine hundred thousand united states dollars only, in a private security and finance company. may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company. this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland.
the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe, introduced a new land use decree/act that, affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks. this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, so to say. infact, a lot of people were killed in this land reform act, including my father.
it is against this back - ground, that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands, forbids a refugee (asylum seeker) to have such a money in an account. i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction. i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history. moreover, the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers.
i must let you know that this transaction is risk free. if you accept to assist me and my family, you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide. this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice.
i have two options of offers for your assistance. you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon, or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum, 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end.
you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is, about this proposal. please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction.
thank for your anticipated co - operations.
peter stevens.

abidjan, cote d'ivoire

dear friend,
permit me to inform you of my desire of going into
business relationship with you.
i am mr andy monga, the only son of late mr and mrs
banabas monga. my father was a very wealthy cocoa
merchant in abidjan, the economic capital of ivory
coast, my father was poisoned to death by his business
associates in one of their outings on a business trip.
my mother died when i was a baby and since then, my
father took me so special. before the death of my
father on january 2002 in a private hospital here in
abidjan, he secretly called me on his bedside and told
me that he has the sum of eighteen million, five
hundred
thousand us dollars (us $18,500,000) left in a fixed/suspense account in one of the prime banks here in
abidjan, that he used my name as his only son for the
next of kin in depositing the fund. he also
explained to me that it was because of this wealth
that he was poisoned by his business associates. that
i should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where i will transfer this money and use it for
investment purpose such as real estate management or
hotel management.
i am honourably seeking your assistance in the
following ways:
1) to serve as a guardian of this fund since i am only
20 years old
2) to make arrangement for me to come over to your
country to further my education and to secure a
resident permit for me in your country.
moreover, i am willing to offer you 15 % of the
total sum as compensation for your effort/input after
the successful transfer of this fund into your
nominated account overseas and 5 % for expenses.
furthermore, you indicate your options towards
assisting me as i believe that this transaction would
be concluded within (24) days you signify
interest to assist me.
anticipating to hear from you soon.
thanks and god bless!
andy monga

now that i have had both services, and having noticed that a google search
yields no definitive answers for people, i wanted to post my personal review
of the two systems.
i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit,
both with terk antennas. the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via
an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca
adapter available from alpine (kca - 121 b). i had xm since it debuted and
sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest.
the bottom line, for those needing a quick answer, is sirius is superior in
sound quality, features (free streaming from their website!), and channel
quality (better music, no commercials, better talk). xm has a few more
channels that make very little difference to the end result (read on).
after careful review of both systems, sirius came out the winnner, as i have
said. the channels are laid out well, lack commercials, sound great, and
are streamed on the internet. the only disadvantage of sirius was its
oft - sited lack of nascar, which they seem to be trying to remedy. also, xm
has an extra comedy channel (it's boring, and features older, censored
comedy), and a few more " experimental " music channels which most will find
totally useless. surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular
(terrestrial) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration. it's
no wonder xm doesn't stream live on the net so that you can try before you
buy. also, xm's channel layout was unfriendly, in my opinion.
the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two, however, are
the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials. not necessarily the
corporate commercials that come from outside companies (which are annoying
in an expected way), but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you've had it up
loud - especially with the windows open (yes, they are that embarrassing).
this, and the better performance of sirius, was the deciding factor in my
cancelling xm.
xm, however, holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent
music and a fair selection of talk. if not for sirius, i would have kept
xm, i think; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no
matter where you go. yet, as is the way of competition, sirius has offered
everything good that xm does and done it right. sirius outshines in the
talk category, with a variety of right and left - wing shows, all of the
useful talk channels xm has, and npr, pri, and a well laid - out channel plan.
xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website. sirius
also has a customer care website, but it is not as robust (less detail).
however, xm doesn't have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all
have to pay xm $6. 99 extra in additon to buying another $200 receiver for
the house. in addition to the crappy commercials, this is probably where
the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows.

Subject: from: duve khumalo.
from: duve khumalo.
tel: + 27-73-230-82-31.
email: duvmalo @ mailasia. com
attn: dear president/md.
with due respect, trust and humility, i use this
medium to write this letter to you irrespective of the fact that you do not know me, but please do consider this letter as a request from a family in dare need of assistance.
let me formally introduce myself. i am duve khumalo, the son of late. dr. robinson khumalo, the renowned zimbabwean wine and cattle ranch farmer.
i got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the south african information exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual/company who can assist me in this business.
during the war waged against the farmers in zimbabwe by the supporters and cohorts of president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, my late father belonged to one of the classes of farmers targeted by the zanu - pf armed group, because he did not support their ideas and policies.
in the course of the revolution in the country, the zanu - pf armed group attacked and invaded my father's farms burning, destroying and eventually killing him. after my father's death last year, i managed to escape the boundaries of zimbabwe into south africa with my mother, because our lives were threatened and zimbabwe was no longer safe for us.
we escaped safely into south africa with my father's lifetime fortune of us $25 (twenty five million
us dollars) cash, bonds, important documents of property title and other valuables, which he instructed i his son on before his death. the money and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes, and were transported to netherlands through diplomatic means.
the boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private security and brokerage firm there in netherlands.
presently, i am residing temporarily with my mother in johannesburg pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for the department of home affairs to grant us political asylum.
at the moment, i am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of netherlands for investments. moreover, due to netherlands government's stringent monetary policies/regulations and the sensitive and volatile political status of the region, it would be most dangerous to attempt investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances.
in recognition of your personal executive powers and investment opportunities that abound in your country, i solicit for your assistance in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our future arrival for investments.
my mother and i have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a brokerage commission of 20 % of the money.
we have also earmarked 5 % for pre - transfer expenses we may incur in the course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during the transaction are subject to refund.
i have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us.
please let me receive your approval or reply through this my email address (khumaduvel 01 @ netscape. net) or phone number above and feel free to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly, send your phone and fax number for easier communication.
if you are unable to assist please be kind to notify me so that i can look for a suitable alternative.
please accept my warm compliments, as i earnestly wait for your urgent response.
best regard,
duve khumalo

three studies assessed staphylococcal endocarditis 21 48 63 one study
assessed any staphylococcal infection 32 and one assessed streptococcal
endocarditis 69 treatment is well ingrained in
existing guidelines and clinical practice with these infections 94 so what
have i done about it? well its still a practicing effort, but i dont just
listen to what a man says. i look to see the connection in a mans actions.
are they putting as much of an effort into the relationship? do i feel that
they really feel what they say they are feeling? and to a fault, i am
skeptical at best that they truly mean what they say. our best ally is our
gut feeling c and we are very guilty of ignoring it. when we ignore it we
are destined to get hurt.

several portfolio companies. abdv has placed acquired multi media assets

e - direct has generated over $100,000 in revenue during its first full month of

from actual press releases: yjycunv
red bank, n. j., aug 24,2004 (primezone
via comtex) - - the following is a letter from john
figliolini, president of atlantis business development
corporation, inc. (otcbb:). ldgkcpf
dear shareholder, addlrko
i am writing to you today to
discuss the new direction which your company will be
heading. up until this point we made it clear that
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
the market. our basic premise was to seek out
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
businesses with the proper equity investment made into
them by abdv. fine wein records is an example of that;
with a financial commitment of $250,000 by abdv we
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
various projects they are currently working on.
e - direct is another example; we should start to see
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
continuing over the next 12 months. however, abdv has
not maintained a particular industry focus. as of
today that has changed. wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
last week we announced that abdv
will be providing $1,000,000 in equity financing to
future quest, inc. (pink sheets:),
a company in the oil gas sector, this was the start
of our new direction. abdv will be dedicated in
locating and provide managerial, accounting and
financing for companies in the energy field, from oil
and gas companies to alternative energy companies. jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
you may ask; why the energy
related field? simply it currently offers many
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
to be made in this sector. according to adjusted
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
of $73 from the 1970 s. however, unlike the oil crisis
of the past, we are looking at what will be a problem
to stay with us for a long time. simply put the demand
for oil world wide has increased by some 2. 5 % this
year alone, most of which is because of china. the
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $20-30
level. we are looking at a trend that is now cemented
in stone. there are more players in the world economy
today that require oil gas to propel their own
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
these higher levels. abdv has already aligned itself
with individuals that have experience in the energy
field. these individuals will help locate viable
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
in these opportunities. wtxrxayfisoira
so what do we do with our
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
records and e - direct? well, first of all we will
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
until they are at a level where they can move on their
own. i believe that both of these companies will be
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now. at
that point i will recommend to abdv's board of
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
shareholders. this strategy is in keeping with the
basic premise of our business module whereby we share
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
public our portfolio companies. we can then continue
to concentrate in the energy - related field. lvxhkmblmcewrw
by concentrating on a specific
sector such as the energy area we will be able to
define abdv's purpose and guide it like a laser. our
goal will be to locate and make investments in no less
than four energy - related businesses over the next 12
months. i believe that by maintaining this focus an
investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative
way to participate in the booming oil gas and
energy - related fields. twqssqlqqkvbdm

sorry not for me and the address is above
the quality of included studies was poor overall we did not detect bias
induced by any of the measures assessed we could not obtain data on all
cause fatality for 33 % of studies it is unlikely that missing results would
shift the results for studies comparing the same lactam relative risk 1 02
0 76 to 1 38 but it is of concern that studies comparing different lactams
0 85 0 69 to 1 05 may not detect important harm to patients
our assessment of treatment effects for patients with p aeruginosa gram
negative and blood infections relies on subgroup analysis we did not detect
an advantage for combination therapy among these patients only few patients
with documented p aeruginosa infections could be evaluated
