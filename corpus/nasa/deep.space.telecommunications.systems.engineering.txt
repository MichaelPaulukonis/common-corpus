Foreword 

The challenge of communication in planetary exploration has been unusual. 
The guidance and control of spacecraft depend on reliable communication. 
Scientific data returned to earth are irreplaceable, or replaceable only at the cost 
of another mission. In deep space, communications propagation is good, relative 
to terrestrial communications, and there is an opportunity to press toward the 
mathematical limit of microwave communication. Yet the limits must be 
approached warily, with reliability as well as channel capacity in mind. Further, 
the effects of small changes in the earth's atm'JSphere and the interplanetary 
plasma have small but important effects on propagation time and hence on the 
measurement of distance. 

Advances are almost incredible. Communication capability measured in 
bits per second at a given range rose by a factor of 10'^ in the 19 years from 
Explorer 1 of 1958 to Voyager of 1977. Tliis improvement was attained througii 
ingenious design based on the sort of penetrating analysis set forth in tliis book 
by engineers who took part in a highly detailed and amazingly successful pro- 
gram. Careful observation and analysis have told us much about limitations on 
the accurate measurement of distance. 

It is not easy to get busy people to tell others clearly and in detail how 
they have solved important problems. JosepJi H. Yuen and the other contribu- 
tors to this book are to be commended for the lime and care they have devoted 
to explicating one vital aspect of a grBat tidvenlure of mankind.

Preface 

A vital, often predominant function in every space mission is that of commu- 
nications. From the moment of launch, the only connection between spacecraft 
and earth is the communications system. This system is responsible for sending 
scientific data back tu earth in the specified quality and quantity together with 
engineering data reporting the condition of the spacecraft. Tlie communications 
system also provides the capability of tracking the spacecraft and commanding it 
to take certain actions. Without an effective communications system a success- 
ful mission would not he possible. 

To appreciate the challenge that one faces in designing sucli systems for 
planetary exploration, one must consider the enormous distances that are 
involved. Voyager spacecraft, for example, are now more than one billion miles 
from earth, tens of thousands of times farther than the most distant communi- 
cations satellite, and continue to transmit data and rer.^ond to commands. 

The necessity of minimizing spacecraft weight presents a major problem to 
communication!! systems designers. The far-reaching implications of spacecraft 
weight become apparent as the designer considers the problems of providing 
power supply, antennas, and other necessary devices and supporting elements, 

Anollier important challenge is the extreme rehability required of the com- 
munications system on the spacecraft. Once the spacecraft is launched, on-board 
failures can no longer be repaired except by use of redundant systems. System 
degradation due to aging, imperfect antenna pointing, or imperfect trajectories 
can be expected; and the designer must know how much degradation to expect 
from each case and must design the equipment, tlie operations, and the proce- 
dures of data analysis accordingly. The telecommunications engineer works with 
the most precise and advanced techniques of the engineering world. 



Since the launch in 1958 of Explorer I, the first free-world satellite, there 
has been substantial progress in Improving communications capability. The fol- 
lowing figure illustrates the communications capability in terms of data bits per 
second sent back to earth. Each space mission lias led to new telecommunica- 
tions designs, and the major factors contributing to improvements are indicated 
in the figure. In order to give a fair comparison, performance has been normal- 
ized relative to the distance from earth to Jupiior, and at a bit error probability 
of 5 X 10"^. This is, in effect, comparing the past 25 years of spacecraft trans- 
mission and receiving system capability with today's Voyager capability. The 
Voyager capability is 115.2 kbits per second at Jupiter range. Explorer I had a 
capability of about 10^'^ bits per second at Jupiter range. Thus communica- 
lions capability has been improved by a billion billion times, i.e., by 10'^. flad 
Explorer I been used to send pictures from Jupiter, it would have taken millions 
of years to send just one. 

Even though substantial progress has been made in tlie List 25 years, space 
exploration is still in its infancy. There has been no exploration beyond the solar 
system. There are numerous galaxies and billions of stars to Investigate. Bigger 
and (Quglier challenges are still ahead; more exciting times ar* yet to come. 
These challenges will undoubtedly call for more advanced telecommunications 
systems to transmit information to and from deep space. Telecommunications 
technology is still in its infancy. 

Through the years, a number of telecommunications design techniques, pro- 
cedures, and analyses contributing to the suc*;ess of deep space exploration 
missions have been developed and applied. The purpose of this book is to pro- 
vide descriptive and analytical information useful for the optimum design, 
specification, and performance evaluation of deep space telecommunications 
systems. The book emphasizes system performance information. Long, tedious 
derivations arc not included. The book shoulu serve to acquaint new telecom- 
munications engineers with the techniques available to them and should summa- 
rize for the experienced engineers the analyses and information necessary for 
their work. It also provides a background for understanding the interface 
between the Deep Space Network and the spacecraft and is intended to facilitate 
the conceptual designs and analyses for the enhancement of telecommunications 
performance and assurance of compatibility between spacecraft and ground 
system capabilities. 

The book, which was started more than one and a half years ago, was origi- 
nally intended to be an update of the widely used Tclecoimmmications Systems 
Design Techniques Handbook, edited by R. E. Edelson, and published on 
July 15, 1972^ by the Jet Propulsion Laborai.ory. However, owing to advancing 
communications technology, it became apparent that a total rewrite was 
necessary.

Profile of deep space telemetry capability 



Chapter 1 herein presents an overview of telecommunications systems. For 
design control, a statistical approach to predict telecommunications link perfor- 
mance and to assess its uncertainty is described. Chapter 2 reviews power spec- 
tral density of a class of digital modulations. The required transmission band- 
width is directly related to the power spectral density of the signaling scheme or 
modulation technique employed. The bandwidth required to transmit the 
chosen moJulation and the ratio of energy-psr-bit to noise spectral density are 
the tv\o important factors in evaluating the efficiency of any communication 
system. Chapter 3 summarizes the basic fundamentals of phase-locked loop and 
Costas loop receivers used for synchronization, tracking, and demodulation of 
phase-coherent signals in residual carrier and suppressed carrier systems. Chap- 
ter 4 describes the radio tracking system used in deep space exploration. The 
radio tracking system provides radio reference carriers which are used for telem- 
etry and command. It also performs radiometric functions in wliich information 
is obtained on spacecraft position and the radio propagation medium. Chapter 5 
treats the telemetry system, whose function is to transmit information signals 
from spacecraft to ground receiver. Demodulation and decoding techniques are 
discussed. Practical system performances of various schemes are presented. Chap- 
ter 6 discusses the command system, whose function is to enable commands to 
be sent to the spacecraft. Chapter 7 describes the spacecraft radio frequency sub- 
system, which is a vital component for the three telecommunications functions 
of tracking, telemetry, and command. Chapter 8 examines spacecraft antennas. 
Chapter 9 outlines a model which combines the statistical description of tele- 
communication link performance with a statistical description of weather 
effects. Chapter 10 documents the computer software used for telecommunica- 
tions performance analysis and monitoring. Software automation is crucial to 
deep space mission opeiation. Chapter 1 1 deals with the selection of radio signal 
frequencies to avoid interference from other spacecraft and other terrestrial 
sources. Chapter 12 presents the basic telecommunications interface properties 
of two new important interfaces: between spacecraft and the space shuttle and 
between spacecraft and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. 

Althougl) this book is intended to be comprehensive, it cannot be. Improve- 
ments and innovations in deep space telecommunications are ongoing, but 
books iiave a stopping place. Also many important allied topics have been 
omitted to limit scope and size. Among the prominent omissions are space- 
craft design, ground communication network, and mission control and com- 
munication facilities. As editor, I have tried to keep each chapter in perspective 
and to allocate to it the appropriate amount of space. However, individual 
authors with different specialties and backgrounds have different opinions and 
styles of presentation. 

All the contributors to this book are with the Telecommunications Science 
and Engineering Division of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute 
of Teclmology, witii the exception of James C. Springett, who is a consultant

Telecommunications Systems Design

1.1 Introduction 

Deep space telecommunications systems are used for tiie transmission of 
information between a spacecraft and a ground station. A typical deep space tele- 
coniiiiunications system is illustrated in Fig. 1-1. It performs three basic functions: 
telemetry, command, and tracking. 

The telemetry function involves the transmission of information from a space- 
craft to earth. This information usually consists of science data, engineeringdata, 
and imaging data. Science data convey information gained from scientific experi- 
ments onboard the spacecraft. These data are moderate in volume but very valu- 
able, witii stringent quality and transmission accuracy requirements. Engineering 
data report the status of spacecraft instruments and systems. These data are low 
in volume and need to be of only moderate quality. Imaging data are of high 
volume. Because of the redundancy present m planetary scenes, imaging data 
need be of only moderate quaHty. 

The command function involves tiie transiuission of information from the 
ground to the spacecraft. Althougli spacecraft are designed with a high degree of 
automation and preprogrammed adaptabilities, command is needed to control 
spacecraft functions, to direct tlie spacecraft to take specified actions, with

specified paramelers, at a definite tinie-Toryximpll.'^o cliaiige flight path. The 
command link is characterized by a low data rate and a relatively low vulume 
of data of extremely high quality to assure a minimum of errors of transmission 
to avoid misinterpretation of commands. 

Tracking yields information on spacecraft position and velocity, the radio 
propagation medium, and the properties of the solar system, thus enabling 
trajectory monitorhig and spacecraft navigation. In their passage through space, 
the signals transiting between spacecraft and ground station are altered by the 
medium throupii which they travel, by gravity, and by tiie relative velcicity of 
the spacecraft and ground stations. Further, tlie signals are delayed substantially 
over these very long paths. By extremely accurate measurements of the radio 
signal characteristics, the position of the spacecraft, its velority, and its accel- 
eration can be determined. Simultaneously, important information is gained on 
the structure, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere of a body that 
may occult the signal, on the plasma stale along the signal path, and on plane- 
tary and solar gravitational fields. Thus the process of transmitting radio signals 
to and from a cooperative spacecraft can allow us to navigate the spacecraft to 
hs destination, measure properties of the gas and plasma in the signal patli, and 
determine gravitational and relativistic effects. These tracking data are charac- 
terized by a very low rats, a need for long-term stability, extreme accuracy of 
measurement, and by the extent of data processing required to turn the signal 
into information. 

The performance of these three functions-telemetry, command, and tracking- 
depends on the amount of signal that is present relative to the noisy environment 
in which the signal must be detected, i.e., a ratio of signal-to-noise strength, and 
the degree of efficiency with which this signal-tu-noise ratio is used. Hence, to 
achieve best possible performance, we must design tlie telecommunication sys- 
tem which gives the highest signal power, lowest amount of noise, and most 
efficient use of signal-to-noise ratio, within constraints sucli as spacecral't weiglu, 
size, and cost. 

Let us illustrate these points quantitatively by considering the telemetry link. 
To begin with, it is important to understand that interplanetary space is essen- 
tially the same as free space as far as the propagation of microwave signals is 
concerned. In the absence of weather effects, the earth's atmosphere is almost 
completely transparent at 2.3 GHz (S-band) and 8.4 GHz, (X-band), which are 
the frequencies being used for deep space telecommunications. Therefore, the 
calculation of received signal strength is a geometrical problem. Let the space- 
craft transmitted power be P-j. at distance r from the receiver on earth. If the 
power were radiated isotropically, the power flux density at the receiver p would 
be the transmitted power divided by the area of a sphere of radius r. The rjtual 
flux density is increased by a factor equal to the gain of the transmitting antenna, 
Gj,.Thus, [l-I], 






oni 



p=-^ (1.1-1) 



where 47rf ^ is the area of a sphere of radius r. The received signal level Pj^ is 
obtained by miltiplying tlie flux density at the receiver by the area of the 
receiving antenna ^^ times the receiving antenna efficiency n\ i.e., 

Pn = pM, (11-2) 



Tlie received power P^ can be increased by three actions. First, tiie trans- 
mitted power Pf can be increased. This, of course, has system repercussions. 
Even though the spacecraft-transmitted power is typically only 20 watts, which 
is less than a dim desk lamp, tiie input power required to generate it represents a 
substantial fraction of the total power available on the spacecraft. Second, the 
transmitting antenna gai" t^f can be increased to focus the transmitted power 
more intensely on the receiving antenna. Better focusing requires a larger space- 
craft antenna (within limits of size and weight constraints) and ttie ability to aim 
the resulting narrow beam. Third, the receiving antenna area can be increased to 
collect as much of the incoming signal power as possible. 

Consider the Voyager spacecraft,' for the transmitting frequency of 8,4 GHz, 
where liie transmitted power Pj- is 21.3 W, the transmitting antenna gain Gj- is 
6.5 X lO** (unitless), and the distance from Jupiter to Earth is 6.8 X 10" m. 
Thus, by using (1,1-1), we find tlie power flux density at the receiving antenna p 
to be 



p - 2.383 X 10"''W/rn=' (1,1-3) 

which is a very small number indeed because of tlie large distance involved. This 
is a measure of liow much the tiansmitted power spreads in the 6.8 X 10*' 
meters. We want to recover some of this with as large a receiving antenna as 
possible. The largest antenna that NASA has is a 64-m-diameter dish (i,e,, 
Aj^ s= 3.2 X 10^ ra^) which has an efficiency of 42%. The received signal power 
is obtained by using (1,1-2) with (1.1-3), 



?^ = 3.05 X 10"'* W (1.1-4) 



' Voyager is a NASA deep space mission wtUi two spacecraft launched in 1977,BotIi reached

{lBm/(Hz K), and J is the system equivalent noise temperature. Equation (1.2-5) 
is valid since microwave frequency signals are currently being used for deep 
space telecommunications. For signals in otlier frequincy regions, such as in 
optical frequencies, different expressions sliould be used [1-1] . 

1.2.3 Carrier Perfcmance Margin 

Carrier performarice margin or simply carrier margin Mg on either uplink or 
downlink is defined as 

where P^. = portion of received power in tlie residual carrier, and Bj^q = one- 
sided thresiiold loop noise bandwidth. Here, F^ is calculated from P^ using 
the modulation indices of the link and depends on the type of modulation used 
(see chapter 5). 

Ttie above dcfmition of carrier margin was chosen b'^cause a phase-locked 
loop receiver loses lock when P^ drops below 2 B^^q Nq watts (see diopter 3). 
Thus, /"^ = 2 Bj^Q Nq defines carrier tlireshold. M^. is calculated as 



and represents tlxe number of decibels tlie received residual carrier is above 
carrier threshold. Another popular name for M^ is carrier SNR in 2B[^q. How- 
ever, tills is a misnomer since Bj^q Nq, not 2 Bj^q A^q, is the noise power in a 
tliresliolding loop. So carrier SNR in 2 Bj^q equals one-half the carrier signal-to- 
noisc ratio in a thresholding Joop, 

Ti;c minimum acceptable carrier margui, in general, is not dB. For swept 
acquisition of tlie uplink, tlie minimum useful P^. is in the neigiiborhood of 
20 Bj^q Nq watts. Tltat is, tlie minimum useful carrier margin is about 10 dB. 
For the downlink, the DSN recommends that carrier margin be at least 10 dB. 
Furtiiermore, carrier margins for two-way doppler may need to be larger than 
10 dB, depending on required radiometric accuracies. 

1.2.4 Telemetry and Command Performance Margins

Of poo:^ QUALiry 

wlwte S is the portion of rcceiveii power in the data modulation sidebands, 
and R is the data bit rate. Here S is calculated from Pj^ using the modulation 
indices of tlie link, Tiie parameter ATZ/Vq to receiver is sometimes denoted by 
ii'^/A^o, wliich is tl.e signal energy per bit to noise spectral density ratio. And 

iT/iV„ output = [ST/N^ to receiver ] /,^^,^„„ (1 .2.9) 



where i'^^.^^„^ is the system losses, Tlircsliold ST/Nf^ is defined by tlie bit error 
probability required of a linlc. 

The bottom tine of a telemetry or command link analysis is the performance 
margin. In dB, 

per formal we margin = STfN^ output - threshold SJ/ZV^ (1 ,2-10) 

1.2.5 Ranging Performance Margin 

The ranging channel involves transmitting a ranging modulation or coclc 
ffoni the DSN to tlie spacecraft, where it is demodulated and tiien, together 
with receiver noise, is used to modulate tlie downlink from the spacecraft to 
tlie DSN (see Chapter 4). The ranging signal-to-noise ratio at the spacecraft is

ranging channel. Mere Pfn,,/!) is ciUciilated from the uplink P^ using the modula- 
tion indices of tlie uplink. The ranging signa'-to-noise-spectral-density ratio

where Pji^mi) is the portion of received downlink power in the ranging modula-

Here, Pjn^ii^ is a function not only of the downlink Pj^ and the downlink mod- 
ulation indices but also a{ ranging input SNR. This is because rangmg is a turn- 
around channel. Some of tlic modulation sidebands on tlie downlink are turn-

1.3 Telecommunications Design Control 

\Vc have seen in Section 1.1 , iisinp ll)o telemetry link ol'Voyaj^ei as an exam- 
pie, lliat there is only a small margin to cover itncertuinlies. Indeed, a small 
number ol' decibels is usually all that separates an inadequate link design from a 
costly overdesipn. This emphasizes the extreme attention which must be paid to 
pcrfoimancc prediction for deep space telecommunications systems. 

If all link parameters were constant and precisely known to the telecomtiiuni- 
cations enjiineer, a simple accounting of the link paranicters could predict 
performance. The real world is not so accommodating, however. Some link 
parameters vary wi'h spacecraft enviroiunent, otiievs with ground station param- 
eters and the comnnmications channel conditions, Some arc associated witli 
link components which have manufacturing tolerances. 

In the early days of space exploration, engineers had little data and were 
relatively inexperienced in designing deep space tcleconjnninications systems. 
Hence they tended to be very conservative. And a deterministic worst-case 
criterion [1-3] was used to assure sufficient link margins in guarding against 
unccitainties, Kxpcrience over many lunar and planetary flight projects has 
demonstrated that this approach is practical from the point of view of engineer- 
ing and management [1-3, 14, 1-5], The major disadvantage of this determin- 
istic worst-case criterion is that it provides no information about the likeliliood 
of nchieving a particular design value. Hence cost tradeoff and risk assessment 
cannot be done quantitatively. 

Over tJie years, more experience was gained in deep space telecommunica- 
tions systems design. A statistical technique has evolved for treating telecom- 
munications performance statistically [1-ft] [1-7], removing the major disad- 
vantages of tlie deterministic approach while preserving its advantages. Since 
1975 tills statistical technique Jias been used in the design of deep space tele- 
communications systems. It is described in this section.

The pci'foniiance assesstnont and tltc design proectlure are described in the 
following section, 

1,3.2 Design Procedure and Criterion 

Before we describe tlie statistical approp.ch used for deep space telecom- 
munications systems design, we exajniHc tlie importajiee of weatlier effects on 
telecommunications peifonnatioe. 

1.3.2.1 Weather Effects. WoatJier requires special consideration. For carrier 
frequencies at or above X-band, the randomness that weatlier introduces to tlic 
link dominates all otlter sources of randomness. There are two techniques for 



17 



OF POOR QUA!.ITY 

incorporating weatlicr into telecommunications design control. The simple one 
of tliese, the percentile weather technique, is described in this section. It is a 
'easonable estimate of the weather effects on link performance. Often a reason- 
able estimate suffices for preliminary system design and performance assessment 
purposes. The percentile weather technique is attractive for its simplicity. On tiie 
other hand, for detailed design and link performance monitoring purposes, a 
more accurate estimate is required. A more elaborate teclmique is treated in 
Cliapter 9 in this book. 

The percentile technique for incorporating weatlier into telecommunications 
design control requires tiie preparation of two design control tables. In the first 
design control table, a dry atmosphere and clear sky over the DSS is assumed. 
In the second design control table, ,v-percentile inclement weatlier is assumed. 
By "jf-percentjle" weatlier is meant tliat with x'/'o probability a pessimistic 
assumption is being made about weatlier effects; moreover, witli (100 - .v)% 
probability an optimistic assumption is being made. As an example, 9S-percen- 
tile means tliat 95% of the time the degradation due to weatlier is less than 
predicted, wliile 5% of tlie time the weather degradation is worse. 

1.3.2.2 Design Procedure. The design procedure is described here. The proce- 
dure unfolds as a sequence of six steps during which the pliilosupiiy of telecom- 
munications design control reveals itself. The discussion below follows [1-6] 
and [1-7]. 

Step J, Three values are assigned to most link parameters: design, favorable 
tolerance, and adverse tolerance. All three values are to be in decibel represen- 
tation. Those parameters which are not assigned three values sliould receive 
only a design value (in decibels). Data bit rate, space loss, and thrcsliold (or 
required) signal-to-noise ratios are regarded as deterministic and only have 
design values. The weatlier-dependent parameters atmospheric attenuation 
and, on tlie downlink, incremental noise temperature due to clouds sliould 
be assigned only design values (noise temperature is in units of kelvin, thougli, 
not decibels). In fact, tiie design values of the weatlicr-depcndcnt parameters 
sliould be based on tlie assumption of clear, dry weatlier. Later on, as explained 
in the previous paragraiih, the design procedure is to be repeated with weather- 
dependent design values assigned on the basis of A--percentilc inclement weather. 
The following definitions serve as a guide in the assignment of values to a link 
parameter: 



Design value = the a priori estimate of a parameter. 

Favorable tolerance = tlie best case of a parameter minus the design value, 

Adverse tolerance = tlie worst case of a parameter (short of failure) minus 
tlie design value. 



18 



OF POOR QUALITY 

Noise temperatures, noise spectral densities, an noise bandwidtlis have favor- 
able tolerances witli negative values and adverse tolerances with positive values. 
The opposite is true of all otlter link parameters that get assigned tolerances. 
Tolerances reflect one or more of the following: a limit cycle, a manufacturing 
tolerance associated witli a link hardware component, a dependence on space- 
craft environment, and other uncertainties. 

Swp 2. Arrange the link parameters in a vertical listinp a design control 
table and identify independent groups among them. 

Step 3. Within each of the independent groups, add the design values and the 
favorable and adverce tolerances so tliat tliere is imly one design value with its 
associated favorable and adverse tolerances for each group. 

Step 4. Assign a probability density function (pdO to each independent group. 
Typically, only uniform, triangular, Gaussian, and Dirac-deha (for those groups 
without tolerances) pdfs are used. The assignment made by the Telecommunica- 
tions Prediction and Analysis Program (TPAT) are tabulated in Chapter 10. In 
case a probability density function is nonzero over the entire real line such as the 
Guassian density function, use the absolute sum of its favorable and adverse 
tolerances as its 6-sigma (6 standard deviations) measure, 

Step 5, Compute for each mdependent group (random variable) its mean and 
variance. Table 1-4 illustrates the computation of mean and variance for the 
common pdfs. Having been computed from a design value and tolerances all 
expressed in decibels, the mean will, of course, be in decibels (and the variance 
in decibels squared). 

Step 6. Compute the mean and variance of the desired performance or carrier 
margin by algebraically summing the means and adding the variances obtained 
in step 5. By algebraically summing is meant tli.it some means those corre- 
sponding to noise spectral density, noise bandwidth, data bit rale, and threshold 
(or required) signal-to-noise ratios are subtracted rather than added. 

It is certainly true that a precise probability density function of the overall 
link margin can be obtained by convolving the pdfs of the A" independent ran- 
dom variables. However, the link margin tolerance distribution is well approxi- 
mated by a Gaussian distribution by invoking the central limit tiieorem since 
tlie overall link consists of K independent random variables formed m step 2 
above. This simplifies tl^e computational complexity to tlie point that hand 
calculation is indeed practical. Moreover, the pdfs of the K independent random 
variables were only estimated. It seems difficult to justify using tedious convolu- 
tion to achieve a precise solution based on imprecise information if an approxi- 
mation is indeed satisfactory. A more worthwhile effort would be making a 
more accurate estimate of the pdfs of the K independent random variables.

The above procedure Is repeated with the weatiicr-depcndent parameters 
being assigned design values based on ;c-percentile inclenterit weather. The 
performance or crrier margin is finaliy considered predicted Avith the specifi- 
cation of four members; 

(1) Mean margin witli clear, dry weatiier. 

(2) Mean margin with x-percentilo weatlier. 

(3) /i-sigina margin witli clear, dry weatlier. 

(4) //-siEma margin with x-percentile weatlier. 

where "/J-sigma margin" equals mean margin minus n standard deviations. The 
value II is typically 3 for command links and 2 otlierwise. 

1.3,2.3 Design Criterion. In order to assure successful operation and guard 
against adverse situations, we must provide sufficient link maigins. Based on the 
design procedure described in the preceding section, it can be stated that, for 
example, Unit performance will not deviate froiu its mean margin by more than 
3-sigma (three standard deviations) with probability 0.99. This 3-s)gma value is 
used as an uncertainty measure for the link. Depending on how much risk we 
are willing to take, we can cljoose any number of sigma values. Hence a useful 
design criterion is: the mean value of the link SNR must exceed the required 
SNR by an amount equal to or larger titan n-sigtna. The value n is typically 3 for 
command links and 2 for telemetry and ranging links.

Spectral Characteristics of 

Digital Modulations 

Marvin K. Simon 



2.1 Introduction 

Two factors tiiat arc important in evaluating the efficiency of any communi- 
cation system are the bandwidth required to transmit tlie chosen signaling or 
modulation technique and the cnergy-per-bit-to-noise-spectral-density ratio. 
Whereas the latter factor is a well-defined quantity, the former can be defined in 
many ways [2-J]. Regardless of the definition, however, the required transmis- 
sion bandwidth ib directly related to tlie power spectral density (PSD) of the 
signaling scheme. Thus, efficient analytical methods for calculating this power 
spectral density are essential if one is to specify the spectral occupancy of the 
transmission channel. 

One very important class of digital modulations is that corresponding to the 
simultaneous transmission of one or more synchronous data pulse streams where 
the underlying data sequences that generate these pulse streams have known 
statistical properties. Techniques for computing the PSD of such pulse streams 
have appeared in the literature and in some textbooks. In almost all cases, each 
sequence is assumed to be either wide sense stationary (WSS), with known

autocorrelation function or, more generally, an A^-ary Markov source with 
known (fixed) stationary and transition probabilities. A special case of the latter 
is a purely random source, i.e., one that omits an elementary signal (pulse) in a 
given signaling interval independent of those emitted in previous signaling 
intervals. Sucii a source can be modeled as a degenerate case of an A^-ary Markov 
source whose NXN transition matrix (the matrix of transition probabilities) has 
identical rows. When N=2, and tlie two elementary signals are the same, we 
have the familiar ease of antipodal binary signaling. 

Occasionally, one finds situations where the generating data sequence is not 
WSS but, however, is cyclostatumar}', i.e., its first two moments are periodic. 
One such case occurs at the output of a convotutional encoder where the period 
(in code symbols) is equal lo the reciprocal of the code rate. Thus, in order to 
characterize llio spectral properties of the output of such an encoder, one must 
have an expression for the power spectral density of a synchronous data stream 
whoso generating sequence is cyclostutionary. 

This section is devoted to reviewing the techniques described above along 
with illustrative examples of how they are used to compute the PSD of 
well-known modulation/coding schemes, We begin with a discussion of the PSD 
of a single synchronous data stream generated by a binary WSS sequence.

where p(t) is the elementary signal (pulse shape) and is not necessarily restricted 
to be time limited to only a single signaling interval, i.e., the pulse train ;n(^) can 
contain overlapping pulses. Irrespective of the properties of the generating 
sequence {/?„}, tJie data stream m(r) is itself cyclostationary since the expected

Furthermore, the discrete spectrum S^(f) of (2.5-16) vanishes. Thus, for all

random NRZ data output sealed (expanded) in frequency by the reciprocal of 
tlic code rate, i.e.. itjb. Tiiis class of codes was defined in (2-2J as "uncorrclated 
convoliitional codes." Note, all rate 1/2, noncatastrophic, convolutional codes 
are uncorrclated codes. 

On the other hand, if the rows of G are such that (2.5-19) can be satisfied for 
at least one combination of p, q, and / (other than /j = (? and / = 0), then letting 
ip, if, 1} denote tlie set of combinations ofp, c/, / (other than p = q and / = 0) for 
which (2.5-10) can be satisfied, (2.5-13) siniplifies to 



S^(J) = 1 +y, ZEEe,cos [2n (nl + q - p)fT] 



(2.5-22) 



Also, the discrete spectrum S^{f) of (2.5-16) still vanishes. Since for such codes 
the encoder outpu^ spectrum differs (in form) from the input spectrum, this 
class of codes was defined in [2-2] as "correlated convolutional codes," 

As an example of a "correlated convolutional code," we observe that any 
code whose generator matrix is such that two or more rows are identical satisfies 
(2.5-19) with / = 0. Short constraint length (up to and including /JT = 14) non- 
catastroplilc codes with maximal free distance for rates J/2, 1/3, and 1/4 were 
investipated and tabulated in [2-4]. Indeed, for rate 1/3 (h = 3), the tabulation 
includes only one correlated convolutional code whinh occurs for A* = 3 (fi = 1) 
and has tlic generator matrix

This code was first found by Odenwalder [2-5] . Since rows two and three of 
G are identical, we must evaluate (2.5-22) for tl:e two combinations p = 2, 
^ - 3, / = 0, and p=3,q = 3,! = Q. Doing so yields tlie simple result 

S^(f) = l+|cos2njT (2.5-24) 

Multiplying S^if) of (2.5-24) by S^(f) of (2.2-6) gives the encoder output

For rate 1/4 (h = 4), the tabulation in [2-4] reveals three correlated convolu-

Receiver Design and Performance 

Characteristics 

Marvin K. Simon and Josepli H. Yuen 



3.1 Introduction 

Tills chapter presents an inlroductory discussion of tlie receivers used in deep 
space communications. The basic structures, principles of operations, and cliar- 
acleristics of these receivers are examined to provide an understanding of the 
important parameters in the design and performance evalu-tion. 

There are two basic types of deep space communications receivers: tlie 
pliase-locitcd loop (PLL) receiver and the Costas loop receiver- and variations of 
these. Phase-locked loop receivers are used in residual carrier systems-the 
traditional deep space communications systems. Costas loop receivers are used in 
suppressed cai-rier systems, which have been increasingly employed in recent 
years, in, for example, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), 
the Space Shuttle, the Muitimcgabit Telemetry Demodulator/Detector (MTDD) 
System in the DSN, the Navigation Satellite Timing and Ranging Global Posi- 
tioning System (NAVSTAR GPS), and the proposed Venus Orbiting Imaging 
Radar (VOIR) for tire mapping of Venus's surface.

ORIGINAL PAQ'i E^ 
OF POOR QUALITY 

Pliase-locked loop receivers are essential to deep space communicalions. Tliey 
make the demodulation of piiase-modulatcd carriers possible, Tliey are integral 
to dopplor tracking systems. Indeed, every spacecraft transponder lias a PLL 
receiver, and tlie heart of a NASA Deep Space Station (DSS) closed-loop receiver 
is a PLL, The spacecraft PLL receiver demodulates command and ranging and 
provides a reference for generating a downlink carrier which is phase cohere • 
with the uplink carrier {but shifted in frequency). On the ground, the DSS PL- 
receiver generates a reference signal which is phase coherent with the downlink 
carrier. This reference is used to demodulate telemetry and rangi.ig and to obtain 
doppler data, 

Tlie Deep Space Network was developed at a time when weak signals and low 
data rates dominated. As a result, residual carrier phase modulation schemes 
Willi phase-locked loops tracking the residual carrier component were employed. 
However, over the years, teclinological advances in antennas, transmitters, and 
signal processing have caused a marked increase in the available signal power and 
hence the achievable data rales. In fact, essentially all of the current or near 
future deep space missions are already operating at or near tlie upper I'nitt of the 
current DSN data rate capability, Tiiis leads to the choice of suppressed carrier 
systems employing Costas loop receivers. However, besides telemetry data rate 
considerations, for other uses of the deep space communication system, e.g., for 
ranging and radio science (see chapter 4), the residual carrier system may still be 
preferred. 

3.2 Phase-Locked Loop Receivers 

Phase-locked loop receivers designed for spacecraft and the DSN are invari- 
ably of the multiple-conversion heterodyne type. Three such examples are 
shown in Figs, 3-1 througli 3-3. Figure 3-1 is the PLL receiver used on both 
Voyager and Galibo, but it is in many respects typical of spacecraft PLL 
receivers. Figures 3-2 and 3-3 are the Block III and Block IV DSS receivers, 
respectively. The noise temperature of a receiver is predominantly determined 
by the design of the first receiver stage because of its very Jiigli gain. For the DSS 
receivers, the first stage is the maser ampliiier at the antenna. For spacecraft 
receivers, it is usually the first mixer. The heterodyne design is employed to 
translate the RF signal down to a frequency for which stable phasn detectors can 
be built. Automatic gain control (AGC) is required to provide a signal whose 
amplitude is within the dynamic range of the intermediate frequency (IF) 
amplifier stages. The bandpass liniiter (BPL) minimizes the total mean-square 
error of the loop over a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratios. This configura- 
tion has been shown in [3-1] to provide near-optimum PLL performance. 

This section presents an introductory description of the design and perfor- 
mance of PLL receivers used in deep space communications. For a more com- 
plete treatment of PLLs, the reader is referred to [3-2] througli [3-8] ,

3.2.1 Phase-Locked Loop Operation 

A phase-locked loop consists of Uiree essential elements, a phase detector 
or multiplier, a loop filter, and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), as shown 
in Fig. 3-4. The input signal }>{t) is assumed to be tlie sum of a sinusoidal 
signal s(r) jind a channel additive noise «/(0i 

y(t) = s(t) + «,C0 = ^/2Psm [oi^t + 0(0] + «/(0 (3.2-1) 

where oJq is the signal frequency in radians, P is the input signal power, 0(t) 
is the input signal phase, and 

«,(/) = n/2 [n^iO cos oi^t " nJiO sin co^f] (3.2-2) 

is a narrowband process. Both ii^(t) and n^(t) are assumed to be statistically 
independent, stationary, wliite Gaussian noise processes of single-sided spectral 
density Nq W/Hz. 

The reference signal at the VCO output is 

r(0 = y/2K^ cos [cj^t + 5"(0i (3.2-3) 

where K^ is the rms output of the VCO, and 8(1) is the phase estimate of 6(0 
generated by the VCO. The signal ^(0 is multiplied by r(_t) to generate an 
error signal 

e(0 = ifjv/XOKf) (3.2-4) 

where Kj^j is the multiplier gain. This error signal e(0 is filtered by the loop 
filter to remove the higlr-frequency terms which are larger than and equal to 
2 ajg, to produce the VCO control signal 

z(0 = f{p)e{t) (3.2-5) 

where p = d/dt is the Heaviside operator. This filtered error signal z{t) drives 
the VCO frequency and phase to match the input signal frequency and phase 
such that 

6(0 = Kyf zQ)U^ (3.2-6) 

where Ky is the VCO gain in radians/sec/V.

Tliis loop bandwidth Bj^ (in Hz) so defined is the bandwidth of an ideal

Wj_ ~ Y~ (3.2-20) 



3.2,2.3 Steady-state phase error. In deep space telecommunications, the input 
phase typically consists of modulation and of doppler due to the radial motion 
of the spacecraft relative to the tracking station of tlie DSN; i.e., 

6(0 = m(0 + d(0 (3.2-21) 

where in(t) is the modulation and d(t) is the doppler. This doppler signal can 
be expanded in a Taylor series so that 

d(f) = 0„ + !^„f + ^ r^ + " • +^+ ■ • ■ (3.2-22) 

where the first three terms are tlie most important for typical spacecraft 
trajectories, with the following physical interpretations: 

0(, = initial phase offset of the incoming signal from the free-running 
VCO phase 

S2(j = frequency offset of the incoming signal from the free-running VCO 
frequency 

Ag = rate of change of the incoming signal frequency 

57 



OF POOR QUAUW 

If £.'(f) has n terms in the Taylor series, tJien a steady-state phase error 

<^ = lim !(£)(/) 

occurs if 

H = fc + 1 

where k is the number of poles in the filter Fis). 

This steady-state phase error vanislies if «<&+ I. If «>*+ 1, the phase 
error ip(t) will become unbounded and tlie loop will eventually lose lock. 

For tlie second-order loop with the filter of (3.2-13), and if c/(r) has only 
the first two terms in (3.2-22), i.e., 

d(t) = ^Q + ^Qt (3.2-23) 

then the PLL tracks this Doppler witii a steady-state phase error

able to acquire lock in a finite period of time if £/(/) is given in (3.2-23) and Q^

3.2.3 Phase-Locked Loop Characteristics in the 
Presence of Noise 

Thermal noise is generated in the receiver, usually in the first front-end 
amplifier stage. Tliis wliite Gaussian noie, which is added to the received 
signal as described in section 3.2.1, prevents the PLL receiver from making a 
perfect phase reference estimate even in the absence of Doppler. 

The behavior of PLL in the presence of noise is important to the telecom- 
munications system engineer because lie must design the tracking, telemetry, 
and command systems to operate in the presence of noise to meet prescribed 
data quality and quantity, 

3,2,3.1 Phase error variance. Under the linear approximation of (3,2-11), the 
variance of the phase error due to additive cliannel noise ri((^) is given by [3-3] 



N„W, 

where (V^ is the two-sided loop bandwidth defined in (3.2-16), and A^q is again 
the single-sided noise spectral density of Wj(r), 



3,2.3,2 Phase error probability density function. Based on the Fokker-Planck 
method, the probability density function (pdf) of the nonstationary phase error 
is developed [3-3] , which in the steady-state gives an unbounded variance due to 
tive cycle clipping phenomenon associated with PLLs, The Fokker-Planck 
method was first successfully applied in [3-13] , [3-13] , and [3-14] to derive the 
pdf of the phase error of the first-order loop by recognizing that the phase error 
reduced modulo 27t is stationary and possesses a bounded variance, A first 
attempt to extend the Fokker-Planck metliod to a second-order PLL is given in 
[3-15], which suggests the possibility of approximating the second-order loop 
phase error pdf by the more trackable results obtained from analysis of the 
first-order loop. 

The actual phase error process ip(t) in a PLL undergoes diffusion much like 
a particle in Brownian motion; hence, the variance of tlie phase error becomes 
infinite in the steady-stale. Previous work [3-12 through 3-14] in determining 
the pdf of tlie phase error in the steady-state of a first-order loop was accom- 
plished by reducing the phase error modulo 27r to a process iji{t). For finding 
telemetry error probabilities, for example, this reduction gives sufficient infor- 
mation; whereas for estimating tracking accuracy, the statistical dynamics of 
the Kp{t) process itself must be studied.

To completely describe the if(t) process, one must account for the compo- 
nent of its variance that results from diffusion -that is, cycle slipping. The 
steady-state effect of cycle slipping must be combined with the variance of the 
phase error reduced modulo 27r to reflect the overall performance of the PLL.

in Fig. 3-5 and compared with experimental results obtained in [3-15], We 
observe liiat both the first-order loop model and the second-order loop model 
compare well with experimental results. Hence for phase error variance compu- 
tation, the simpler first-order loop model can be used, 

3.2,3,3 Cycle slipping, A PLL slips a cycle when the magnitude of its phase 
error ip(t) exceeds 2rr radians. The occurrence of a cycle slip is a random 
event caused by the noise in the PLL, Cycle slip introduces errors in Doppler 
tracking. The two parameters characterizing cycle slip are the meiin tijne to 
first cycle slip t and the average number of cycle slips per second S, 

The mean time to first cycle slip is defined as the average time the phase 
error ^(t) takes to go from to ±27r radians, assuming the PLL is initially in 
phase lock; i,e„ <fi(t) = 0, Here r can be computed b>', [3-3] ,

3.2.4 Phase-Locked Loop Preceded by 
Bandpass Limiter 

The mechanization of a BPL is illustrated in Fig, 3-7; the limiter incorpo- 
rated in the PLL system is shown in Fig. 3-8. BPLs are used in PLL receivers to 
maintair a constant total power at the input to the loop. This minimizes the 
total mean square error of tlie loop over a wide range of input signal-to-noise 
rDiins. BPLs are used also to protect various loop components, the multiplier in 
particular, where signal and noise levels can vary over several orders of magni- 
tude and exceed the dynaml: range of these components. In this section, results 
needed to explain the behavior of a PLL when preceded by a BPL are sum- 
marized. The detailed theory and operation of the BPL are covered more com- 
plitelyin [3-3] and [3-18] through [3-201.

We now define a factor P called the limiter performance factor by the ratio

Thus the reciprocal of T is the product of the input/output signal-to-noise 
ratio as given by (3.2-52) and the ratio of the equivalent noise bandwidth at 
tlie phase detector output to the IF bandwidth. For any value of p^, it is clear 
that WJW^'> 1/2, since passing noise of known bandwidth through a zero- 
memory nonlinear device can only increase the equivalent noise bandwidth. 
The factor of 1/2 is due to the bandpass to low-pass bandwidth transforma- 
tion. Hence, an upper bound on V is simply given by 2 times the reciprocal of 
(Pq/Pj)- An exact analytical expression for T (or equivalently H^/H^/) is quite 
difficult to develop. For our case of a rectangular noise spectrum, a good 
approximation to V is given by a rational function, wliich is simpler to usj in 
system design, suggested in [3-5] (later corrected in [3-20] ) and is given by

3.3 Suppressed Carrier Modulation and 
Tracking Loop Considerations 

Tliis section begins by examining tlie choice between suppressed and resid- 
ual carrier systems [3-21] . The DSN emerged at a time wlien wealc signals and 
low data rates dominated. As a result, residual carrier phase modulation 
schemes with phase-locked loops tracking the residual carrier component were 
employed. However, over tlie years, technological advances in antennas, trans- 
mitters, and signal processing have caused a marked increase in the available 
signal power and hence the achievable data rates. In fact, eisRntially all of the 
current or near-future deep space missions are already optsrating at or near tlie 
upper limit of the current DSN data rate capability. 

When tlie DSN operated at 8 bps using residual carrier modulation, it was 
necessary to place tlie data modulation on subcarriers since direct modulation 
of tJie data on tlie carrier would cause most of the data power to fall within 
the bandwidth of, and to be tracked out by, tlie carrier phase-locked loop. 
The DSN is currently involved in new higli rate telemetry system designs 
[3-22 througli 3-24] which will pusli the data rate into the tens of megabits 
per second region. At these higlier data rates tiie data signal spectrum is 
extremely broad so that even if subcarriers were not used, the part of the 
spectrum which would be contained in the loop bandwidth would be flat 
across this band and thus appear as white noise. Since the ratio of loop 
bandwidth to data rate is, in these situations, typically quite small, this addi- 
tional wliite noise component degrades the tracking performance veiy little. 
Tills observation is further aided by tlie fact that we aie already dealing with 
a greatly improved carrier loop SNR (relative to low data rate operation) by 
virtue of the fact tliat in order to support the higher data rates one must 
supply more signal (and lience carrier) power. 

The above arguments suggest that subcarriers are not needed in high data 
rate systems. This leaves the question as to whether or not a residual carrier 
component should be provided for or is it preferable to fully suppress tlie 
carrier, thus allocating all of tlie transmitted power to the data modulation. 
Consider first a residual carrier signal of the form 

yit) = y/2P sin (W(,r + e„, ;»(/)) + ",(0 

= y/2F cos 0„ sin u^t + \/2P sin <?,„m(f ) cos oi^t + n^{t) (3.3-1) 

where P is tlie total signal power, oj^ is the carrier radian frequency, d is 
the modulation angle (0< f^^j < 7r/2), m{i) is a ±1 binaiy data modulation 
with symbol rate R^ = 1/7^, and as before ;j,(r) is a bandpass "white" Gaussian 
noise process. If the signal or(3.3-l) is demodulated by a reference signal

is an equivalent lew-pass white Gaussian noise process with single-slded noise 
power spectral density N^ W/Hz,

(3.3-3)) lias a flat spectrum over the pliase-locked loop bandwidth with equiv- 
alent single-sided spectral density

The first factor of (3.3-6) represents the loop SNR corresponding to the case 
where the total signal power is available for carrier tracking. The numerator of 
the second factor represents the degradation of this SNR due to the split of 
the total power between carrier and data modulation, while the denominator 
of this second factor represents the degradation produced by the modulation

self-noise in tlie loop. Clearly for large values ofR^ (e.g., 9.6 dB for uncoded 
binary PSK at an error rate of 10"*), the loop SNR is severely degraded by 
the need to track on a residual carrier component. 

Aside from the increased noisy reference loss (additional signal power 
required to produce the same error probability performance as that corre- 
sponding to a perfect carrier sync reference) caused by the degraded loop 
SNR, tliere Is an inherent loss in data power (relative to the total power 
available) just due to the split between carrier and data modulation as in 
(3.3-4). 

Next we consider the situation in which the carrier is fully suppressed and 
tlie signal is of the form 

yit) = \/2P m(t) sin oj^t + n^lit) (3.3-7) 

Since j'(f) of (3.3-7) contains no residual carrier component, a PLL cannot be 
used to establish the desired carrier demodulation reference signal. Instead one 
must use a suppressed carrier type of tracking loop, e.g., a Costas loop (see 
Fig. 3-11). Since a detailed discussion of the behavior and performance of 
such a loop will be presented in the next section, we sliall merely give the end 
result here for the purpose of comparison with (3.3-6), namely,

modulation, i.e., BPSK, similar advantages of a suppressed carrier over a resid- 
ual carrier format can be demonstrated for other forms of modulation, e.g., 
balanced quadriphase-shift-keying (QPSK) and unbalanced quadriphase-sliift- 
!;eying (UQPSK). In the following sections, we present the various carrier 
synchronization options for tliese suppressed carrier modulation forms, begin- 
ning with a discussion of carrier recovery for BPSK modulation. Before pro-

section by reemphasizing ind stressing the key issues that distinguish 'Jicse 
various carrier synchronization methods from the more traditional discrete 
carrier version, i.e., tlie PLL. It is lioped that the reader will understand the 
reasons for the amount of discussion that follows and its relative importance 
within the overall framework of this book. 

It is clear from the word "suppressed" that a discrete spectral line does not 
appear in the input spectrum. Thus, the carrier synchronization loop must 
reconstruct the carrier from the data-bearing signal itself, which now contains 
all of the available signal power. The abil'.y to accomplisli this mission is thus 
dependent on the form of the signal modulation and hence a different syn- 
chronization structure must be discussed for each of these forms. (In some 
situations, it is possible to use a given structure for more than one modulation 
type.) Beyond this, the behavior of tlie synchronization loop and its perfor- 
mance depend on the data synibol format. Indeed, for a given modulation 
type, the design of a Costas-type receiver for optimum tracking performance 
requires that the bandwidth of its arm filters be selected in accordance with 
(1) the data symbol rate, (2) the arm filter type, e.g., 1- or 2-pole Butter- 
worth, and (3) the data format (NRZ, Manchester, etc.). All of these degrees 
of design freedom require a multidimensional investigation over and above, 
but not separated from, tlw usual considerations of loop design associated 
with the loop filter (loop bandwidth, loop damping, etc.), the latter being the 
only design considerations required for a PLL. Indeed the PLL has no arm 
filters, and aside from the amount of power allocated lo the residual carrier 
component, which might be a function of transmitted signal form, its design is 
in no way governed by the above modulation-dependent considerations. 



3.3.1 Carrier Recovery for BPSK Modulation 

As slated above, the form of carrier recovery loop is, in general, dependent 
on the form of modulation. For the three modulations mentioned above, 
namely, BPSK, QPSK and UQPSK, the carrier recovery loops are varietal 
versions of what if commonly referred to as a Coslas loop [3-25] . Thus we 
begin this section with a description of the conventional Costas loop and its 
operational behavior for BPSK modulation, 

3.3.1.1 The conventional Costas loop and its equation of operation. Consider 
the Costas loop illustrated in Fig, 3-11. An estimate of carrier phase is 
obtained by multiplying (ushir two phase detectors) the input suppressed 
carrier signal s{t) plus noise «;(0 with (he output of the VCO and a 90-deg 
phase shift of itself, respei tively, filtering the results of these two multiplica- 
tions, and using the product of the two filtered signals to control the phase 
and frequency of the loop's VCO output. When the filters in the in-pliase and 
quadrature-phase arms of the Costas loop are mechanized with integrate-and-

where N^(t) and j\^(<') are approximately statistically independent, stationary, 
white Gaussian noise processes with single-sided noise spectral density Nq 
W/H/ [3-6] and single-sided bandwidth %<coo/27T. 

Using standard analysis techniques analogous to those applied to phase- 
locked loops [3-6], it may be sliown [3-25] that the stochastic integro- 
diffcrential equation of operation of Fig. 3-1 1 becomes 

2^ = 2n^~KF(p) {P<m2(0>sin2^r) + r^,[AM0l} (3.3-15)

(intcgrate-&nd'duntp, sample-and-Iiold) gives approximately a •' or greater 
advantaee over the passive single-pole circuit for Rj^ dB. Fur example, at 
Rj= "4 dB, the advantage is 5.16 dB. When compared to an ideal filter, the 
improvement is typically only 4.4 dB at R^= -4dB. Notice also that for 
R^[^■ ^ dB, the Costas loop with active matched filters in the arms gives 
approximately the same performance (0,5 dB inferior) to that of a Costas loop 
with no modulation present (a C\V loop). 

3.3.1,5 Titc polarity-type Costas loop and its equation of operation. It is 
becoming increasingly popular (e.g., the carrier tracking loop in the Mu'.ti- 
megabit Telemetry Demodulator and Detector (MTDD) of the DSN) in the 
design of suppressed carrier receivers, which employ Costas loops for carrier 
reconstruction, to hard limit the output of the in-phase channel. Doing so 
allows replacement of the analog multiplier, which forms the loop error signal, 
with a chopper-type device which typically exhibits much less dc offset. Gen- 
erally speaking, introduction of a limiter (hard or soft) into a system results in 
signal suppression the amount of which is a function of the signal-to-iioise 
ratio at the limiter input. Tliis signal juppression in turn reduces the total 
loop gain and, as a consequence, the loop bandwidtli. 

In tliis section, we address the tracking performance of sucli a hard-limited 
Costas loop (often referred to as a "polarity-type" Costas loop) and compare 
its performance with that of the conventional Costas loop previously dis- 
cussed. Typically, for small detection signal-to-noisc ratios, one will find that 
the inclusion of the hard limiter results in a tracking performance penalty, 
whereas for large detection signal-to-noise ratios, such inclusion indeed results 
in a performance improvement. 

Realizing that the input signal and noise processes can still be modelled as 
in (3.3-13) and (3.3-14), respectively, then analogously to (3.3-15), the loop 
equation of operation for the polarity-type loop is given by {3-27]

3.3.2 Carrier Recovery for QPSK Modulation 

A i:cnerali/ecl version of the Costas loop of Fig, 3-11, wlilcli applies to 
BPSK, QI'SK, am! 8-PSK inotiulations, is illustrated in Fig. 3-18. Unfortu- 
nately, 3 complete analysis of this loop is not presently available. Tiuis we 
resort to consiJering tiie counterpart of this looji wherein the passive iow-pass 
arm filtcts are again replaced by active ami {liters of the intcgrncc-antl-diimp 
typo. This loop is generally referred to as a quadriphase polarity-type I-Q loop 
or quadriphase 1-Q loop, depending respectively upon whclber or not hard 
limitcrs arc included in the In-phase arms. The former is illustrated in Fig. 
J-1*). Its analysis follows along tho same lines as that of the equivalent biphase 
loop. Thus, we shall omit the details and merely present the final perfomtance 
results. 

The mean-stiuare phase jitter tracking perfomiance of the loop illustrated in 
Fig. .1-10 is given by a relation analogous to (3.3-26), namely,''

power ratio will provide the necessary motivation for the discussion which 
follows. 

An unbalanced QPSK signal is defined analogous to (3.3-13) as 

sit) = ^/2F'^ m^U) cos (co,/ + 0{t)) + VTF^m^it) sin (w/ + 6(1)) 

(3.3-59) 

where /*j and Pj represent the powers in the two quadrature components, 
/»,(0 and m^U) are two independent binary signal waveforms, and cjj, Oit) 
are previously defined for the BPSK case. Added to s(t) of (3.3-59) is the 
noise process characterized by (3,3-14) wliich thus forms the received signal 
from which carrier synchronization is to be derived. 

For a UQPSK modulation as characterized by (3.3-59), the system designer 
has two options with respect to selecting an appropriate carrier recovery loop. 
If the ratio of the channel powers P^ and P2 is sufficiently large (usually a 
ratio of 4 or more is sufficient), then a conventional Costas loop such as that 
in Fig. 3-1! can be used to reconstruct the suppressed carrier* [3-29, 3-30]. 
We shall restrict our attention here to the tracking performance of such a loop 
(see Fig, 3-1 1), particularly summariiing the results given in [3-29] . 

3,3.3.1 Loop tracking performance. We start by arbitrarily assuming that 
channel 2 corresponds to the higli data rate channel. Next, we define the 
following parameters in terms of wliich the loop mean-square phase jitter and 
squaring loss can be expressed. 

«=■=- = -^ = ratio of data symbol rates

X = -p- = ratio of channel powers 

^ (3.3-60) 

P = P^+P^ ~ total signal power 

^T2 ~ N ~ *°^^' power-to-noise ratio in Irigli data rate bandwidth. 

Then, based upon tlie results derived and presented in [3-29] , the variance of 
the loop phase error 20 is once again expressible .n the form of (3.3-26a), 



The uiir illter bandwidth is now chosen to be opiimuni for the higli data rate channel.

Since the demodulation reference signals of Fig. 3-1 1 are again at cjq rather 
tlian 2*0^. the mean-square phase tracking jitter on the output data streams is 
given by (3.3-26b). We conclude tlien that, as in the BPSK case, characterira- 
tion of the loop squaring loss in terms of the system parameters is sufficient 
for predicting the loop's tracking performance.

3.3.4 Automatic Gain Control Considorations 

In piactice. the iniplementaiion of a suppressed carrier reconstruction loop 
requires cross-coupled control loops and elements other than the ones which 
serve to track the phaiiloiii carrier. This is duo to several I'acts of which the 
two most important are: 

(U The dynamic ranj'.e of the received signal level may vary over a ranpe 
of 100 dn or moie. 

(i) The received sijuial phase and I'reijuency dynamics generally require a 
sync acquisition control loop to accoiumodate the uncertainties in the 
received carrier fresHiency.

Signal level varia'ioiis are usually coped witli by means of an autonutie 
gain control (AGO loop coupled with the suppressed carrier tracking loop. 
The major purpose of the AGC loop is to niaiiitaiti a "constant" signal level 
into the receiver's front end so that linearity of receiver operation is main- 
tained. As a by-product of the anipliUide control loop, a lock detection sipnal 
for circuit supei^-ision during sync acquisition to tracking handover is also 
generated.

lates the signal and noise at the IF to baseband. The AGC loop filter removes 
the noise and the clean dc output signal controls the IF amplifier gain. 

On the contrary, very little information appears in the literature on AGC 
for suppressed carrier systems. The one exception to this statement is a paper

Ftg. 3-24. A simpte block diagram of an automatic gain control (AGC) loop 



by Wcbcr [.^-.'.'J which discusses a decision-directed AGC loop for use with 
M'3xy amplitude- and phase-shift l<eying (MAPSK) systems, in particular Af-ary 
iiraplitude-shift-keying (MASK) and quadrature aniplitude-shift-keying (QASK). 

A Costas loop receiver which incorporates both lock detector and AGC 
functions is ilhistrated in Fig, 3-25. The AGC input is derived from the square 
of the in-phase Costas loop output/'^, wliich is proportional to P cos^^. Thus 
this type of AGC 's referred to as a partially coherent power AGC in that the 
AGC loop must be open during acquisition and closed by a sv/itch upon 
detection and verification of lock. More often than not, a fully noncoherent 
type of power AGC is employed wherein the AGC input is derived from the 
sum of the squares of the in-phase and quadrature outputs (/^ + Q'^), which is 
proportional to P {ms^ ^+ siti'^ 0) = P. Thus this type of AGC loop can 
remain closed during carrier acquisition. Tlit primary ['Jsadvantagc of this type 
of loop is that when the loop is in lock (nominally, = 0), then the /^ + 2^ 
signal contributes twice tiie noise as compared to tiie /^ signal of the partially 
coherent AGC. 



It is well known [3-(i] that the bandwidth, natural frequency and damping 
of a loop which employs the phase-lock principle all depend upon the loop gain 
This gain is proportional to the received signal level, Thus, in addition to main 
tainin^, linearity in the receiver front end, the AGC serves to regulate the varia 
tion of the above performance parameters. We now examine this behavior in 
mathematical terms for the conventional Costas loop with and without a non 
coherent AGC. 



Figure 3-26 illustrates a conventional Costas loop with no AGC and a perfect 
integrating type of loop filter. For this case the threshold loop damping param- 
eter (typically 0.707) at the threshold (minimum) signal-to-noise-spectral-density 
ratio Pj^INq is

namely, 

/2 Q^ ^ P m-U ) cos 2^([) + vJn 2<fiU) +-'1 (.U.74) 

The consei]nence of replacing 2\p by 2*^+ir/2 in I'j is merely of mathematical 
curiosity since both r, (/, 2<f] and Pj(/, 2^ + 7r/2] have identical noise spectral 
densities, namely N/^^^ (see [^JA'-^) which is all that Is important from a per- 
formance standpoint. 

Typically, the lock detector is designed such that the noise bandwidth 0;^^

3.3.5.2 Lock detection performance measures. Lock detection performance is 
typically measured by false alarm probability Pp^ and mean time to false 
alarm 7)-^ when tlie loop is out-of-lock, and false dismissal probability Ppj^ 
and mean time to false dismissal Tp^ when the loop is in-lock. These perfor- 
mance measures are defined below: 

^FA ~ probability that loop Is declared in-lock (and thus sweep is termi- 
nated) when loop is indeed out-of-lock 

Tp^ ~ mean time for a false alarm event to occur 

Ppp = probability tiiat loop is declared out-of-lock (and thus sweep is 
reinitiated) when loop is indeed in-lock 

Tpp = mean time for a false dismissal event to occur 

In order to evaluate these performance measures and express them in terms of 
the detection probabilities of the previous subsections, or equivalently, the 
tracking loop and lock detector parameters, one must specify a specific lock 
detector verification algorithm. 



3.3.5.3 Lock detector algorithm and false alarm performance. As an example, 
consider that an in-lock condition is declared only if the threshold is exceeded 
twici? in succession. A Markov state diagram corresponding to this simple 
algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 3-30. Here, the transition probability p is the 
probability of V exceeding the threshold as given by (3.3-81) and q= I - p is 
the probability that Kdoes not exceed the threshold. Furthermore, 7); i = 0, 1 
is the dwell time for state /; i = 0, 1 ; e,g , Tq corresponds to the time between 
successive samplings (tests) of the threshold output. 

The analysis that produces Pp^ and Tp^ from Fig, 3-30 follows the well- 
known theory associated with finite Markov chains [3-34] . In particular, we 
have that

Chapter 4 
Radio Tracking System 

Julian C. Breidenthal and Tomas A. Komarek 



4.1 Introduction 

This chapter describes the principles and techniques of deep space radio 
tracking. The emphasis here is on the measurement functions of radio tracldng, 
since the problems of establishing and maintaining radio contact are well covered 
elsewliere in this boolc, 

Tlie organization of this chapter is deductive, that is, it proceeds from a gen- 
eral description to increasing levels of detail. An effort has been made, however, 
to stop at the level of detail tliat might be found in the "Theory of Operation" 
section in a particular instrument's operation manual. This section briefly 
describes the tracldng system and how it is used. Section 4.2 describes the uses 
of tracking data, which motivate tiie specific measurements made. Section 4.3 
focuses on measurement techniques, while Section 4.4 examines the errors 
inherent in these measurements. 

4.1.1 Purpose 

The radio tracking system Jias a dual purpose for deep space exploration. 
First, the radio tracking t-ystem performs radiometric functions in which infor- 
mation is obtained on spacecraft position, the radio propagation medium, and 



OF POOR QUALITV 

tlie properties of tlie solar system. This information makes important contribu- 
tions botli to the navigation of spacecraft and to the scientific value of deep 
space missions. Second, the traclting system provides radio frequency carriers 
and additional reference signals that are used for telemetry and command func- 
tions. The latter function is discussed elsewhere in this boolt. 

4.1.2 System Description 

The tracking system consists of all equipment that is used to generate radio 
signals to and from the spacecraft and to receive, track, and record the proper- 
ties of these signals. The actual elements of the system differ depending on 
whetlier two-way (round-trip) or one-way measurements are being made. 

The two-way system begins with a Deep Space Station frequency standard, 
exciter system, transmitter, and microwave system, which are used to generate 
an S-band (2-GHz) radio frequency carrier signal.' This signal can be modulated 
by command or ranging signals and is then amplified to a power level of 20 kW or 
more (Fig. 4-1). The resulting radio wave is tlien collimated and directed toward 
tlie spacecraft by a 34- or 64-m parabolic antenna and an associated pointing 
system. The radio wave from tlie earth is intercepted and focused by an antenna 
on tlie spacecraft. 

The spacecraft receiver uses a phase-locked loop to lock on to and track the 
uplink carrier, producing a reference signal whose phase is coherent with the 
uplink carrier (Fig. 4-2). This reference signal is used to demodulate ranging and 
command signals from the uplink carrier. 

The ranging signal demodulated by the receiver is passed through a bandpass 
niter with a typical bandwidth of 1.5 MHz. This baseband ranging signal is 
controlled in amplitude to provide a constant power of the signal and uplink 
noise combipjd. Additionally, sine wave signals in the range 0.5 to 20 MHz are 
generated for differential one-way ranging (DOR), These DOR signals are ob- 
tained by frequency division from either the received carrier or from another 
oscillator on ijoard the spacecraft. Both baseband ranging signals, the ranging 
signal from the uplink and the DOR signal, can be used to modulate the down- 
link carrier. 

Tiie downlink exciters coherently multiply the receiver reference frequency 
to obtain S- and X-band carrier signals that are slightly higher in frequency than 
the received carrier signals, by tlie ratio 240/221 for S-band and 880/221 for 
X-band. Alternatively, fixed frequencies unrelated to the uplink carrier, from 
either an auxiliary crystal oscillator or an ultrastable crystal oscillator, can 



' Or possibly iilso X-band (8 GHz) on some spacecraft,

Uowiilink. carrier signals witli railtlinp and DOR iiiodiilatioti. Tiie phase- 
niodulaled signals are tlien aniplified by a transmitter and colMnialed by an 
antenna lor transTnission back to earth. 

Tlie radio waves iVoni the spaoecral't are intercepted and rociiscd by a .?4- or 
()4-in antenna on the eartli and arc immediately amplilied by a low noise niaser 
uinplilior. Tlie amplitled sitinal can then be received in one of two distinct 
niatincrs: either open loop, in wliicli a propranimed local oscillator is used to 
translate the received signal to an intermediate frequency Tor subseiiuenl rocord- 
inp, or closed loop, in which a phase-locked loop is used to jnoduce a reterence 
signal coherent with the received signal. In the latter case, the reference signal is 
used to demodulate telemetry and ranging signals and estimate the difference in 
frequency between the reference signal and the received signal (doppler fre- 
quency). Separate equipment can be used to estimate the lime delay between 
the transmitted and received ranging modulation (ranging) or the relative time 
delay between two stations (DOR), 

The one-way tracking system begins with the spacecraft oscillator and pro- 
ceeds through the ground system in the same manner as the two-way system, 
with the exception that round-trip ranging cannot be pertormed. 

The (racking system produces the tollowing outputs; 

(1) Coherent carrier reference signals. 

(2) ['reqiiency of received signal (doppler). 

(3) Round-trip time delay to spacecraft (range). 

(4) Direction of received signal (angles). 

(5) Intensity of received signal (A(iC), 

(it) Recordings of waveiorm and spectrum of received signal (open-loop 
recording). 

4.1.3 Tracking Technique 

The following paragraphs describe the various ways in whicli the teleconnnun- 
ication link can be configured for radio tracking. An often used equivalent 
description of tracking mode specifies the type of measurement being made. For 
instance, guided by the list of outputs above, the terms are "coherent carrier 
tracking," "doppler tracking." "range tracking," "angle tracking." etc, 

(1) Oitc-wiiy [racking. The spacecrai't generates a radio signal (a downlink) 
from an onboard oscillator that is then received and tracked by an earth- 
based receiver. No transmission is made to the spacecraft. 



126 



OR/GJI\JAL PME e 
OF POOR QUALITY 



(2) Two-way tracking. An earth-based transmitter generates a radio signal 
(an uplink) tliat is tracked by the spacecraft receiver. TJie spacecraft 
transmits a downlinit that is coherent with the uplink, which is then 
tracked by an earth-based receiver using the same frequency standard 
and antenna as the original earth-based transmitter (Fig. 4-3). 

(3) Three-way tracking. Two-way tracking is performed by one eartli-based 
station, while another station using either a different frequency standard 
or a different antenna tracks tlie downlink. 

(4) Two-way noncoherent tracking. Identical to two-way tracking, except 
that the spacecraft transmits a downlink that is not coherent with tlie 
uplink, but is derived instead from a free-running onboard oscillator, 
usually an ultrastable crystal oscillator. 



4.2 Uses of Tracking Data 

4.2.1 Navigation 

4.2.1.1 Doppler frequency. Consider tiie distance between a spacecraft and an 
earth-based tracking station. Under the assumption that the distance to the 
spacecraft is large compared to tlie radius of the earth, Hamilton and Melbourne 
have shown tliat this distance obeys the formula [4-1, 4-2] 

p(t) = i'(t) + ojr^ cos 6p sin (wf + + X + a^) (4.2-1) 

where 

p(t) = time derivative of distance between spacecraft and tracking station 

/■(r) = time derivative of distance between spacecraft and center of earth 

tj = angular rotation rate of earth, rad/sec 

r = distance of tracking station from earth rotation axis

The coordinatts to wliich the Haniiltoii-Melbourne equation applies are

It is possible to measure p(r) by observing the change in frequency intro- 
duced on a radio link between the spacecraft and the tracking station. This 
change in frequency arises as a consequence of the Lorentz transformation in 
tiie special theory of relativity. In tlie simplest passible case the spacecraft 
would transmit a constant known frequency /j., and the tracking station would 
receive a frequency [4-3]

Substitution of (4.2-1) shows tliat tlie doppler frequency will undergo a 
sinusoidal variaiion due to tiie rotation of the earth, about a mean which varies 
slowly due to the relative motion between tlie spacecraft and tiio earth (Fig. 4-5). 
Whenever tlie station location and the transmitted frequency are itnown, the 
declination of the spacecraft may be found from the amplitude of the sin- 
usoidal variation, and the right ascension from tlie phase of the sinusoid. The 
geocentric velocity may be found from tlie mean value, and the geocentric 
acceleration from changes in the mean value of the sinusoid [44,4-5] , 

Practical measurements of doppler frequency ahnost always make use of two- 
way or tiuee-way teclmiques, in which an earth-based reference oscillator trans- 
mits a signal to the spacecraft, where it is coherently multiplied in frequency, 
retransmitted, and subsequently received at the original transmitter (two way) 
or anotJier earth station (three way). These two round-trip teclmiques are 
preferred because the most stable reference oscillators, e.g., a hydrogen maser, 
are too massive for spacecraft use. Then (4.2-2) must be modified for practical

Thus, we have found within a ihort lime six parameters describinn the location

rectly to the parameters describinp position and velocity. The radial distance to 
the spacecraft has not been measured directly. Init remains hidden in a con'liitia-

In this case a model ol the dynamics of the solar .systcfii is constructed, and

instant when the spacecraft position and velocity are known ^e.^,. immediately

craft followed the predicted (rajeclory, and (lie parameters ol the original model 
are adjusted to minimi/e the weitihted squares of tire differences between the 
actual and predicted measurements. The radial distance to the .s]iacecraft can 
then be determined from the model trajectory. This process is termed orbit 
determination and is usually repeated frequemly for any one spacecraft (see 
Tip. 4-(>), The accuracy of orbit determination depends on the aceuracv of the 
measurements, the geometric characteristics of the trajectory, the time span 
over which the observations are made, and the acciirac\ of earlier knowledge of 
the model parameters.

The distance between a spacecraft and a tracking station may be measured by 
impressing modulation on tiie radio signal from the station to tlie spacecraft. If 
tiie modulation is retransmitted by tlie spacecraft and received on the ground, it 
will Iiavc been delayed by a time equal to the time of flight of tlie radio signal. 
For instance, suppose that a continuous sinusoidal modulation A cos <jf is 
placed on the carrier to the spacecraft. The modulation subsequently received at

OF POOR QUALITV 

The ambiguity factor A', wliich arises in any modulation of finite period, 
must in general be determined by indepei'dent means, e.g., by extrapolation 
from previous knowledge of the spacecraft trajectory. There is an obvious 
tradeoff between laow accurately N can be predicted and the precision with 
wliich tlie round-trip distance can be measured; higher modulation frequencies 
can yield more precise determination of distance, but place more stringent 
demands on the fractional error of N. This tradeoff is usually circumvented by 
using a succession of frequencies, in which the highest frequency determines the 
precision of the measurement, the lowest frequency determines the required 
accuracy of prediction of N, and flie intervening frequencies provide enougli 
information to determine the precise ambiguity of the higliest frequency [4-8] . 

It should be noted that the time delays introduced by hardware must be 
removed so tiiat tlie measured time delay corresponds to a distance, and that 
certainly some assumption must be made about t!ie siieed of propagation of the 
ranging modulation. This calibration process is described in detail in Section 4.4. 

4.2.1.3 Very long baseline interfcrometry. This subsection, as edited, is adapted 
extensively from an article by D. W. Curkendall [4-7] . 

In very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), eacii of two widely spaced 
antennas observes a single (broad band) radio source, e.g., a quasar, simultane- 
ously recording the received signal over a specified frequency interval. The 
recordings of tlie received voltage (Fig. 4-9) are digitized ..t the one-bit level, 
and timing information is added so that the recordings may be cross-correlated 
later when brouglit to a central site. The (expected) cross-correlation function 
can be shown to be approximately [4-9]

Usiiip typical values of 2300 MM/ and 2 MM/, as the RF and recorded band- 
widtli, respectively, this correlation function goes through one complete cycle

In addition it also inani/'esls a (.siii x)/x cliJiracttvislic ejjvdope rcacljinp its first 
mill at 0.5 fjsee delay. Those two components arc called, respectively, "fringes" 
and the "delay resolution function." For these same typical values, r, (or 
equivalently Ap/c. Fip. 4-8') can he measured directly, by adjusting r^^^ so as to 
maxinii/e the delay resolution function, to an order of 10-nsec precision (3 m 
in one way distance). More powerful nicasurenicuts can he obtained, however, 
in each of two conceptually different ways: 

(1) Observation of the source continuously over the common visibility 
period of the two stations (approximately 4 hr on Uic baseline afforded 
by the DSN lor sources near the ecliptic) produces a continuous record 
of the phase of the fringes versus timo. The record thus obtained will 
contain a diurnal sinusoidal modulation term due to the earth's rotation, 
wl'ose pliase and amplitude are parametric in the source location and 
baseline jjaramolcrs. This is e.\actly analogous to the single-station 
coherent doppler tracking, except tJiat the equatorial baseline projec- 
tion and longitude play the roles of the distance olTtho spin axis, r^, and

clocks replaces the geocentric velocity term observed by the coherent 
data. 



(2) Observation of the source at a second center frequency, co,, produces a 
second measurement of the fringe phase, , at a single instant of time. 
Because

a direct measurement of r can be obtained in the short time required to 
acliicve a high S/N for the measurements (typically 10 min). This is the 
"bandwidth syntliesis" technique, so-called because large effective band- 
widths can be obtained without the need for commensurate high record- 
ing rates [4-9, 4-10] . The geometry is exactly as for tlie differenced 
range measurement already discussed (cf Figs. 4-6 and 4-8); the r 
measurement obtained can be used directly to estimate either the base- 
line projection or source location, 

Equivalently t may be determined by cross-correlating a modulated 
spacecraft carrier received at tlie two VLBI antennas, and applying 
(4.2-7) and (4.2-8) witli the quantity (p^ + P^)/v replaced by t . Repeti- 
tion of this technique, alternating between a spacecraft and a quasar, 
reduces several error sources (notably clock and media effects), and is 
known as differential one-way ranging (DOR). Again, the geometry is 
the same as for differenced range, but DOR is usually only used to 
estimate the spacecraft location; quasar location and baseline projection 
are assumed known. 

With spanned bandwidths, cj^- w^, on the order of 40 MHz, the preci- 
sion of the measurement can easily be brouglit to the centimeter level; 
its accuracy is dominated by other effects such as clock performance and 
systematic calibration errors. 

When estimating source locations witli this method, a second baseline 
is usually employed for the second component of position. An effective 
combination for the two baselines is to have a large polar component 
associated with tlie first and a large equatorial projection associated wltli 
the second so that tliey can produce largely uncorrelated estimates of 
right ascension and declination. 

Thus, these two methods, often referred to as narrow- and wide-band VLBI, 
respectively, have a one-to-one correspondence with tlie two coherent modes,

doppler and differenced ranging, normally used for spacecraft tracking. Tlieir 
normal applications complement each other in a bootstrap process. VLBI is 
usually employed to estimate Die station baselines; precise source coordinates 
are needed to enable this. Coherent tracking is normally used to estimate the 
spacecraft coordinates; precision station locations are needed for this task. 

4.2.2 Radio Science 

Each of tile parameters of an electromagnetic wave that may be measured, 
namely, its frequency, phase and group delay, intensity, and polarization, is 
affected by the properties of the media traversed by the wave. Because the radio 
waves to and from tlie spacecraft traverse so many media, these signals liave 
proven to be a rich and complex source of information about the solar system. 
This is especially true when measurements of several electromagnetic param- 
eters are combined together or combined with some other complementary 
observation. 

The following sections describe the most Important of tlie uses to which 
tracking data have been put so far. New uses arc constantly being devised; 
tlierefore, the reader is also encouraged to take advantage of tlie scientiiic 
literature. Comprehensive descriptions of the uses of sjiacetraft radio signab 
are contained in [4-11], [4-12], and [4-13]. A more extensive guide to refer- 
ences appears in the appendix, 

4.2.2.1 Mass and gravity fields of planets and satellites. The motion of a space- 
craft over almost all of its journey througli the solar system is governed by the 
gravitational fields it encounters. The motion can, of course, be discerned 
tlirougli doppler, ranging, and VLBI measurements, so the spacecraft becomes a 
i-?sl probe for tlic gravity fields through which it moves. The acceleration in- 
duced during planetary encounters or orbits is usually large enougli so tiiat the 
total mass of a planet can be determined, as well as several moments of the mass 
distribution. Tliis information can be used to limit the class of plausible interior 
models of the planet, including its chemical composition. Due to tiieir smaller 
effects, it has only been possible to measure tlie total mass of satellites, although 
some Iiigher moments might be determined for the largest satellites in the future. 

4.2.2.2 Pressure, temperature, and composition of ntmosphcre. Measurements 
of tlie received frequency of tlie radio signals from a spacecraft during planetary 
occultation can provide information on the angle of refraction in a planetary 
atmosphere. Knowledge of this angle and the spacecraft trajectory makes it 
possible to estimate the index of refraction as a function of height, which in 
turn can determine the relative temperature and pressure as a function of heiglit. 
Knowledge of atmospheric composition can make these profiles absolute. 

The intensity of radio signals passing tlirougli an atmosphere provides an 
independent measurement of the index of refraction as a function ofheiglil, in 

138 



OF POOR QUALITY 

tliis case because differential refraction leads to defocusing of tJie signal coUi- 
mated by the spacecraft antenna. In addition, tlie loss due to microwave absorp- 
tion or scattering by cloud condensates, vapors, or primary atmospheric constit- 
uents at low altitudes can provide information on the location, density, and 
other characteristics of the absorbing or scattering material. 

4.2.2.3 Electron density of ionospheres, solar coronii, and the interplanetary 
medium. The velocity of propagation of radio waves in a tenuous plasma depends 
on both the average density of electrons in the plasma and, inversely, on the 
frequency of the wave squared (4.4-6, 4.4-7). Knowing the distance to the 
spacecraft, and measuring the difference in arrival time of signals at two fre- 
quencies, one can infer the average electron density along the ray path. If this 
difference is observeu over a period of tine, it is possible to infer tlie density 
distribution of plasma about tlie solar system or within the solar corona. Simi- 
larly, tiie difference in doppler frequency during a planetary occultation can be 
used to infer the distribution of plasma in an ionosphere, 

4.2.2.4 Experiments in general relativity. Tht gravitational field of the sun 
induces an extra time delay on radio signals passing near the sun. The photons 
compiising the radio waves to and from tlie spacecraft are deflected in a mannci 
similar to the deflection of massive particles in a hyperbolic trajectory around 
tlie sun, althougli the effect has a different magnitude. The effect is largest for 
ray paths that graze the solar limb, and measurements of the round-trip signal 
delay to a spacecraft have provided tlie most sensitive test so far of ray bending 
by tlie sun's mass. 

An important experiment in general relativity that has not yet been per- 
formed, but wliich is in development at the time of this writing, concerns the 
detection of gravitational radiation. Hypothetical bursts of gravitational radia- 
tion, arising possibly from the collapse of galactic nuclei into extremely massive 
black holes, would induce a characteristic three-pulse response in the measure- 
ments of two-way doppler frequency. Tliis response is due to small changes in 
ground and spacecraft oscillator frequency caused by a temporary general rela- 
tivistic red shift witiiin the passing gravitational wave. If sufficient frequency 
stability of spacecraft radio signals can be obtained, it is possible that the char- 
acteristic signature of gravitational radiation may be found in two-way doppler 
frequency. 

Finally, it is also possible to measure the general relativistic red shift of 
spacecraft oscillators witliin the gravity field of Jupiter and Saturn to an accuracy 
of approximately 1%. While tliis is not competitive with experiments performed 
on earth-orbiting spacecraft, measurements at Jupiter and Saturn constitute 
independent and simpler tests. 



139 



4.3 Measurement Techniques 

Measurements with tlie tracking system are made with several liardware 
assemblies whicli are described below: the Metric Data Assembly, the Ranging 
Demodulator Assemblies, the Planetary Ranging Assembly, and the Radio Sci- 
ence Subsystem (Fig. 4-10). 

4.3.1 Metric Data Assembly 

The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) measures the frequency of tlie doppler 
signal obtained from the doppler extractor of the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem 
(Fig. 4-11). Additionally, tiie Metric Data Assembly controls many of the 
ground elements of the tracking system and provides radiometric data transfer 
to and from a ground station, althougii these functions are not discussed here. 

The measurement of doppler frequency is performed by doppler counters 
and resolvers within the MDA. The phase d(r) of the doppler signal is continu- 
ously measured by counting positive zero crossings of sin 6(t), and the count 
is sampled at fixed time intervals T^ ranging from 0.1 to 60 sec (Fig. 4-12). The 
resolver further refines the phase reading by measuring the elapsed time between 
tiie latest sample point and the next following positive zero crossing. The time 
interval is measured by a clock of a relatively high Trequency^ (100 MHz) so 
that only a small quantization error results. 

The doppler signal obtained from the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is a. biased 
doppler signal. That is, instead of from (4.2-4), a one-way doppler signal is 
obtained from 

/;, = /;,-/j,+4=4+4 (4.3-1) 

where 

/^ = biased doppler frequency 

f^ = unbiased doppler frequency 

/jj = earth-received carrier frequency 

/y, = spacecraft transmitted carrier frequency 

/jj = doppler bias frequency (±1 to ±5 Mliz) 

The bias frequency is introduced to distinguish between the positive and nega- 
tive doppler frequencies caused by approach or recession of a spacecraft.

4.3.2 Ranging Demodulation Assemblies 

Two Raneing Demodulator Assemblies (RDAs), one for S-band and one for 
X-band, cross-correlate tlie received ranging signals with a ranging signal from the 
Planetary Ranging Assembly (Figs. 4-13, 4-14, and 4-15). The ranging signal 
from the Planetary Ranging Assembly is a square-wave model of the expected 
received ranging signal, and is provided in two versions differing in phase by 
90 deg. An intermediate frequency consisting of a 10-MHz carrier phase modu- 
lated by the received rangmg signal is provided by the Receiver-Exciter Subsys- 
tem. This intermediate frequency Is passed through a I-MHz single-sided band- 
width band-pass filter centered at 10 MHz and mixed with tlie model ranging 
signals. The output of the mixers is a 10-MHz sine wave whose phase depends on 
file relative phase between the model and received ranging signal. This phase 
difference is then detected and averaged by mixing with a 10-MHz reference 
signal and passing the signal tlirougli a low-pass iilter to yield the final correla- 
tion voltages [4-14] . 

4.3.3 (Planetary Ranging Assembly 

The Planetary Ranging Assembly (PRA) measures round-trip group delay 
from the correlation voltages provided by tliC Ranging Demodulation Assemblies 
(Fig. 4-13). The PRA generates a square-wave ranging signal, which is phase- 
modulated on tlie uplink carrier by the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem, and also 
generates a square-wave model of the ranging signal for use by the Ranging 
Demodulation Assemblies. The PRA then estimates the time delay between tlie 
transmitted and received ranging signal, the signal-to-noise ratio of the received 
ranging signal, and the differenced range versus integrated doppler [4-141. 

The transmitted ranging signal is generated by coherent frequency division 
from the frequency reference used to generate the uplink carrier. Usually a code 
consisting of a succession of frequencies is generated, starting with approximately 
I MHz and decreasing by factors of two to as low as approximately 1 Hz. This is 
done in order to provide a precise determination of time delay up to an unavoid- 
able ambiguity of I /isec, and subsequently increase the size of the ambiguity to 
a value which could easily be determined by other means. 

The generation of the model ranging signal is similar to the generation of the 
transmitted signal, althougli two factors complicate this process. First of all, the 
received rasiging signal has been shifted in frequency by coherent multiplication 
in the spacecraft, by tlie doppler effect, and to a much smaller extent by inter- 
vening refractive media. Obviously, it would be useless to attempt to measure

range by cross-correlating two signals of differeiii frequencies; therelbre, a pro- 
cess known as "doppler rate aiding" is used. In doppler rate aiding the reference 
frequency used to generate the model code is modified to take account of tlie 
downlink frequency sliift. The reference frequency is identical to that used for 
tlie transmitted code until a designated time T^. wlten Uie doppler signal front 
the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is mixed with the reference sign-il to obtain a 
frequency equal to tlie reference plus the doppler frequency. TItereafter tlie 
model code is coherent with the received code and cross-correlation becomes 
meaningful. 

Secondly, the received ranging signal necessarily is available for correlation 
only after travelling to and from the spacecraft, possibly as long as several 
hours after transmission. Thus, it is necessary to record the time of transmission 
of a range code and arrange the model code to coincide with the predicted 
arrival of the received code. 

The time delay between tlie transmitted and received ranging signals and the 
noise on the received signal are estimated by sampling tlie outputs of the Rang- 
ing Demodulator Assemblies every 1/4 sec for a period of time and applying the 
foU«-ving formulas (see also Fig. 4-16):

In the presence of time varying dispersive media, for instance, when the 
ranging signal passes tlirough tlie interplanetary plasma, the doppler rate aiding 
scheme described above wiii not be exact. This is because the phase delay mea- 
sured by doppler will evolve differently from the group delay measured by 
range, causuig tlie received code to drift from the model code. This drift 
between successive estimates of range is called differenced range versus inte- 
grated doppler (DRVID) and is measured continuously by the Planetary Ranging 
Asrembly. 



4.3.4 Radio Science Subsystem 

Open-loop recording performed by the Radio Science Subsystem is usually 
considered to be part of the Radio Science System ratlier tlian tlie tracking sys- 
tem, but is included here because of its importance in the use of tracking data, 
for both navigation and radio science.

OF POOR QUALITY 

TJie open-loop recorders in the Radio Science Subsystem are used to record 
on tape spacecraft waveforms that iiave been translated to baseband by the 
open-loop receivers (Fig, 4-17). Open-loop recordings are used to determine 
tlie spectrum of a spacecraft signal in radio science experiments, or to deter- 
mine the group delay of quasar or spacecraft radio signals in VLBI or DOR 
measurements. Additionally, tliese recordings are made for two orthogonal 
polarizations for each frequency band recorded, e.g., in right-circular and left- 
circular polarization. This makes it possible to determine the orientation of a 
received linear polarization (from the relative phase between the circular com- 
ponents) or the degree of depolarization of any initially known polarization 
(from tlie relative amplitude, or noise on the relative phase between the circular 
components), 

Two types of recording devices are employed, which may be used indepen- 
dently or in combination. The Occultation Data Assembly (ODA) performs an 
8- or 12-bit analog-to-digital conversion of the voltages applied to four input 
channels and records the results on a computer-compatible tape, up to a band- 
widtli of 10 kHz per channel (narrow bandwidth recording). The ODA also 
controls the local oscillator for open-loop receivers and records frequency 
control and measurement information along with the digitized voltages. 

The Digital Recording Assembly (DRA) performs an 8-bit analog-to-digital 
conversion of one channel, or 1-bit conversion of up to 28 channels, ap to a 
bandwidth of 2 MHz per channel. Tlie DRA can be used to record a single wide- 
band signal from an open-loop receiver (wide bandwidth recording), or tlie 
signals of four receivers which have been stacked in frequency by the ODA to 
form a single composite signal (medium bandwidth recording). 



4.4 System Error Control 

The tracking system capability allows measurement of the combined effects 
of spacecraft velocity and propagation media variation with an accuracy of 
better than 0.1 mm/sec rms for frequency observations integrated for 60 sec. 
Range measurements of the combined effects of spacecraft position and media 
time delay can be measured to an accuracy of better than 2.0 m rms, for range 
measurements integrated over 60 sec [4-17] . It is expected that VLBI measure- 
ments will yield angular accuracies of a few tens of milliarcseconds. Each of 
tliese numbers assumes signal-to-noise ratios typical of deep space missions. 

Actual measurements of spacecraft position and velocity do not achieve these 
accuracies because of errors introduced in caluration for tlie media effects 
discussed in Subsections 4.4,1.1 and 4.4.1.2. Final determinations of velocity 
and range achieve accuracies of approximately 1 mm/sec and 30 m, respectively.

4.4.1.1 Troposphere. The effective patli length of an electromagnetic wave in a 
refractive medium is

path 

where 

s = effective patli lengtli 

It = index of refraction = c/v < 1 

(il = element of length along the ray path 

In general, tlie index of refraction is a function of frequency and location, 
but the frequency dependence may be neglected for spacecraft radio signals in 
tiie eartli's troposphere. The dependence on location cannot be neglected, and 
througli Snell's law leads to bending of the ray path. The increase in patli length 
due to the troposphere ranges from 2 m at the lenith to 100 m at the horizon, 
and the angular deflection ranges from zero at the zenith to 1/2 deg at the 
horizon [4-18]. The difference in patli length between S-band and X-band is 
less than 1 cm. 

The refractivity of the troposphere at a given location was approximated by 
Smith and Weintraub [4-19] as 

Tj = 77.6 X 10~*|y + 4810-^1 (4.4-2) 

where 

r) = refractivity 

H = index of refraction = 1 + tj 

P - pressure, mbar 

T = temperature, K 

U = water vapor partial pressure, mbar 

The first term gives tlie refractivity of a dry atmosphere, and witliin 7 km of 
tlie earth accounts for 90% of the total refractivity. The second term gives the 
refractivity dUsJ to water vapor. 



152 



OF POOR Q'JALITV 

The total refractivity at the zenith can be related to tlie surface weather con- 
ditions, provided tliat the troposphere is assumed to be (1) in hydrostatic 
equilibrium, (2) an ideal gas, (3) spherically symmetric, and (4) subject to con- 
stant gravitational acceleration. Under these assumptions, the one-way range 
corrections at tlie zenith for the dry and wet components of the atmosphere 
are, respectively [4-18] ,

pQ = surface pressure, mbar 

Tq = surface temperature. K 

Uq = surface water vapor partial pressure, mbar 

D = troposphere vertical dimension, mm 

The one-way range correction for an arbitrary elevation angle can be obtained 
by scaling Ap(90°) with the function R(9), wliich is approximately 1/sin Q. An 
empirical function fori?(fl), which is accurate to within a few percent^, is

A = 1.43 X 10"^ (dry), 3.S X 10"" (wet) 

B = 4.45 X 10-^ (dry), 1.7 X 10"^ (wet) 

Systematic errors in phase and group delay measurements calibrated with 
the above equations arise to the extent that tlie assumptions mentioned pre- 
viously fail to describe the troposphere. Systematic errors in one-way range at 
zenith of at least 2 cm for the dry component or 2 to 4 cm for the wet compo- 
nent have been noted [4-18] . The zenith errors are correspondingly increased 
by R (6) at smaller elevation angles. 



Numerical tables of greater accuracy can bo obtained.

Hence, the phase velocity is increased, and the group velocity is decreased by

This is identical to (4.2-4) except for the last term, which is due to the time rate

The spacecraft received frequency is coherently multiplied by the spacecraft 
and, neglecting the very small change in the downlinit charged-particle effect 
due to uplink radial motion and charged particles, yields the following equation

The instantaneous received frequency is, therefore, 









(4.4-14) 



Thus, the frequency of the received signal will be altered by any changes in 
the columnar electron content. Tliis change in frequency typically reaches 
values at S-band corresponding to a velocity of about one millimeter per second 
[4-18] due to tlie diurnal variation of the earth's ionosphere, but can be cali- 
brated by several means. For instance, since the effect of charged particles is 
dependent on frequency, the difference in frequency between the S- and X-band 
downlinks on some spacecraft yields a measure of the variation of the columnar 
electron content on the downlink.

The magnitude of the S-band group delay due to charged particles in the

opposition at a distance of a few AU to 1 km or more for spacecraft at superior 
conjunction. 

4.4.1.2.3 Differenced range versus integrated doppler {DRVID), As the name 
suggests, DRVID is defined as tlie difference between cJianges in thp apparent

4.4.1.4.1 Dopplcr sampling interval. The timing signals generated by the Deep

For biased dopplcr frequencies near 1 MHz, a 5-nsec error in sampling time cor- 
responds to an error in phase of 1.8 deg, 

4.4.1.4.2 Dopplcr ra'tJ/vtr quantization error. The doppler resolvcr uses a

doppler frequency, loading lo a lO-nsec (2 nsec in the future) uniformly lii'ttrib- 
uted error in tlic measured phase. Assuming a biased doppler frequency near 
1 MMz, this results in a unilbrmly distributed error of a 3.6-deg width, or an rnis 
error of 3.6/>/T2= I.Odeg. 

4.4.1.4.3 Reference oscillator instability. Reference oscillator instability has 
two effects: a drift in frequency that occurs during the time of fliglit of the 
signal to the spacecraft (described ui Fij-. 4-18), and an accunudated phase error 
during a doppler sampling interval (described in Figs. 4-19 tiirougli 4-32). 

4.4.1.4.4 Patli delay instability. Figure 4-23 shows the error requirement for 
patit delay for the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem. Since the actual distribution of 
the patli delay variation is not known, it is assumed to be uniform within the 
given bounds. The corresponding doppler frequency variance is

(3) Systematic error due to aging of the spacecraft transponder with magni- 
tude unknown, but believed to I- )ess than 6 nsec. 

(4) Systematic error due to calculation of "Z-qorrection ^'^^'^ measure- 
ments on individual components, magnitude unlcnown, but believed to 
be less than 1 nsec [4-24] . 

4.4.1.4.6 Waveform distortion. Filtering of a square-wave ranging signal by the 
1 ,5-MHz spacecraft transponder bandwidth and nonlinearities in modul;itors and 
power amplifiers lead to a systematic error when time delay is determined by 
correlation between assumed perfect square waves. Tliis error depends on time 
delay ?nd has a peak value of about 7.4 nsec for 500-kHz unfiltered ranging, but 
less than 0.6 nsec for I -MHz filtered ranging [4-25] , The current mechanization 
of the Planetary Ranging Assembly measures waveform distortion and plasma 
variation simultaneously with the DRVID mode, so this error can be removed 
when there is small piasma activity, with an accuracy limited by thermal noise. 

4.4.1.4.7 Miiltipath. Reflection of received carrier signals from antenna supports 
and microwave interfaces and subsequent superposition with the main signal can 
result in systematic enor in group delay measurements. Several studies have 
shown that these effects are less than 5 nsec for 64-m antennas, and less than 
0.5 nsec for 26-m antennas when the signal source is in the far field [4-26 to 
4-28] but can be as large as 10 to 15 m for near-field measurements [4-29] .

4.4.2 The Radiometric Design Control Tabfe 

Tiie performance of the tracking system is controlled in a manner similar to 
that used for control of the performance of the telemetry and command sys- 
tems, namely, through a design control table (DCT) [4-30] , In principle, all 
three typ'" of DCTs tabulate the properties of a number of random variables 
that are summed to obtain the random variable of interest. In the case of telem- 
etry and command DCTs, the variable of interest is a signal-to-noise ratio or per- 
formance margin; for radiometric DCTs the variable of interest is the value of a 
measurement of frequency, range, or angle, etc. 

A slight difference in teclmique arises because radiometric system perfor- 
mance cannot be measured in terms of the mean or "true" value of a radiometric 
measurement in the way that communication system performance can be mea- 
sured in terms of the mean value of a performance margin. In radiometric sys- 
tems the performance is measured in terms of the standard deviation of a mea- 



168 



OF POOR QUAUn^ 

surenien'., and hence the standard deviation is the only value tabulated in a 
radiometric DCT. 

Ideally, the probability distributions of all sources of random error would be 
known, and calibration schemes leaving at most a random error of known distri- 
bution would exist for all forms of systematic error. Then the expected measure- 
ment error could be determined by convolution of all the known probability 
distributions. Tliis is far from the case in the radio tracking system, and, al- 
though the situation has been consistently improved, we are forced to make 
several simplify big assumptions. 

Assumption I, All random errors are stationary, Gaussian, and zero mea.i. This 
is true for random error due to tliermal noise, but is justified for other random 
errors by the fact that tJie combination of a number of independent probability 
distributions tends toward a Gaussian probability distribution, in tlie limit of 
large numbers of probability distributions (Central Limit Theorem). This 
assumption leads to tlie root sum of square (RSS) technique for determination 
of the expected standard deviation of a measurement. Specifically, 



?(^°<'.') 



"(^) = / y.[T~ °(~^)] (4.4-27) 



where 

a(q) = standard deviation of the quantity being measured, (7 

a(Xj) = standard deviation of a random variable x. that generates error in q 

-= — = rate of change off/ with respect to x^ 



The quantity tabulated in radiometric DCTs is always (Sq/Qx!) aQc^), except for 
totals, wliich are always a(q). 



Assumption 2. d'librated systematic errors leave a residual random error which 
is assumed to be stationary, Gaussian, and zero mean. This is motivated by tlie 
experience tliat over many days or years systematic error appears to be ran- 
domly distributed. In some cases, such as calibration of plasma effects through 
dual-frequency measurements, or calibration of ground station group delay, a 
significant fraction of the remaining systematic error arises from thermal noise 
during the calibrating measurement, and hence may be considered to be random 
over a large number of measurements. 



169

Assumption 3. Uncalibrated systematic error is assumed to be uniformly distrib- 
uted witliin a certain region. Tlie standard deviation of tlie uniform probability 
distribution is tlien used as an entry to the table: 

(4.4-28) 
12 

where a is the width of u.uform distribution. 

One final comment is required concerning the radiometric DCT. Generally, 
the DCT applies only to a single, spcciilc combination of hnk, spacecraft, 
ground, and processing parameters. However, several combinations of parameters 
may appear in a single table under tlie guise of adverse and favorable tolerances. 
For Instance, in the repiesentative* DCT in Table 4-1, the adverse column uses 
the assumption of a heavily modulated carrier (telemetry at 8.5 dB and ranging 
at 6 dB carrier suppression) and relaxed spacecraft temperature control (4.0°C 
peak to peak). These factors lead to increased thermal noise and decreased space- 
craft frequency stability, respectively. The favorable and adverse tolerances 
shown do not represent uncertainty in the assignment of standard deviations, 
but rather tliey represent the range of conditions that miglit occur during 
mission operations.

Telemetry System

5.1 Introduction 

A telemetry system conveys data collected by scientific instruments, as well 
as engineering information on the status of spacecraft, to the Deep Space Net- 
work (DSN). These days, telemetry systems are entirely digital. Not since the 
Rangers and the Lunar Orbiters of the 1960s has an analog telemetry system 
been designed into a deep-space mission. Of course, an analog information 
source can be made compatible with a digital telemetry system througli the 
processes of sampling and quantization. Accordingly, this chapter addresses the 
means of telemetering digital data from a spacecraft to the DSN. 

5.2 Description of the TelerTietry System 

A typical deep-space telemetry system is illustrated in Fig. 5-1. The data are 
encoded for energy efficiency, then used to phase-modulate a square-wave sub- 
carrier, which in turn phase-modulates a microwave sinusoidal carrier. Upon 
reception by the DSN, the signal is routed from antenna to receiver. The receiver 
tracks the carrier and translates the signal down to an intermediate frequency 
(IF) coherent with the station reference. The Subcarrier Demodulator Assembly 
(SDA) translates tlie signal down to baseband and demodulates the subcarrier.

Tlie output of the SDA is synchronized by the Symbol Synchronizer Assembly 
(SSA), then decoded by a Maximum Likelihood Convolutional Decoder (MCD) 
if the spacecraft uses a convolulior.al code, 

5.2.1 Deep Space Telemetry Phase-Shift-Keying l\Aodulatlon 

A class of nuKliilation schemes has proven best for the deep-space ciiannel. 
The most typical telemetry modulation for deep space is to phase-shift-key the 
data onto a square-wave subcarrier and then phase-modulate onto a sinusoidal 
carrier (PCM/PSK/PM). This is the scheme depicted in Fig. 5-1, However, an 
alternate sclieme phase-modulates llie data directly onto tiie carrier. In this latter 
case, the data being binary pliase-shift-kcyed is called PCM/PM, In the abbrevia- 
tions PCM/PSK/PM and PCM/PM, the acronym PCM means "Pulse Code Modu- 
lation" and serves as a reminder tliat the information is digital. PCM/PSK/PM 
and PCM/ PM are well suited to the deep-space channel because; (1) phase-shift- 
kcying is the most efficient binary signaling sclieme [5-1 and 5-2] and (2) a 
phase-modulated carrier has a constant envelope. 

The constant envelope property is important because the final downlink 
amplification stage on the typical spacecraft is a traveling-wave lube operated in 
a nonlinear (saturation) mode. If the modulated downlink carrier does not have 
a constant envelope, distortion will result. 

Before proceeding to the matliematical descriptions of PCM/PSK/PM and 
PCM/PM, the issue of data formats needs to be addressed. Various data formats 
are illustrated in Fig, 5-2. With a Non-Return to Zero-Level (NR2-L) data for- 
mat, a logical "one" is represented by one level and a logical "zero" by the 
other. Witli NRZ-M (Mark), a logical "one" is represented by a change in level 
and a logical "/.ero" by no change. NRZ-S (Space) is the same as NRZ-M but 
with the roles of "one" and "zero" reversed. NRZ-M and NRZ-S are often 
referred to as differential encoding. It is important to note that differential

encoding is itot an example of error-correction encoding. With Bi-Phase-Level 
(BI-0-L), a logical "one" is represented by one cycle of a square wave and a 
log.'cal "zero" by one cycle of a square wave with reversed polarity. Bi-0-L is 
often called a Manchester code; but, again, it is not an example of an error- 
correcting code. Bi-<A-L is identical to NRZ-L when the latter's data are phase- 
revcrsal-keyed (i.e. pliase-shift-keyed with a signaling level of ±90°) onto a square- 
wave subcarrier whose cycle period equals tlie bit period, so tiiat a transition 
occurs at mid-bit. Thus, PCM/PM with Bi-t^L data formatting is a special case of 
PCM/PSK/PM with NRZ-L data formatting. 

A modulated carrier, in the cases of both PCM/PSK/PM and PCM/PM, may 
be (assuming nothing else modulates the carder) represented mathematically 
by

normalised modulated square-wave subcarrier (in the case of PCM/PSK/PM). 
In Uw latter case, the telemetry is invariably phase-rcrcrsaZ-keyed (i.e., phase- 
sliift-kcyed with signaling levels of ±90°) onto the subcarrier. Furthermore, 
phase-reversal-keying a square wave with a data sequence is the same as multi- 
plying the square wave by the data sequence. So

If 0° < < OO", tins phase-modulated carrier comprises a pilot tone (residual 
carrier) and a Double-Sideband (DSB) modulated carrier. A system with 
< ^)Q° is called a residual carrier system. A system with Q = 90" is called a 
suppressed carrier system. A residual carrier receiver employs a phase-locked 
knip to track the pilot tone and provide a colierent reference for demodulat- 
ing the DSB-modiilaled carrier [5-3], A Coslas loop may be used as a sup- 
pressed carrier receiver [5-3]. Up until now, all decp-space-probe-DSN digital 
telemetry systems have been of the residual carrier type.

The SQPSK signal can be represented similarly to (5.2-8), the only differ- 
ence being in the alignment of tiie two bit streams. The odd and even bit 
streams, transmitted at t!\e rate of I t2T baud, are synchronously aligned in 
QPSK (Fig. 5-3), such that their tninsitions coincide. SQPSK modulation is 
obtained by a shift or offset in the relative alignments of di[t) and t/oC^) by 
an amount equal to a bit time T. Figure 5-4 shows the offset, and the follow- 
ing equation defines the SQPSK signal. 

SCO = s/FdiU + T) cos o}^t + sfPd^it) sin w^r (5.2-9) 

Using a well-known trigonometric identity (5,2-8) can also be written as

values 45°, 135", 225°, and SIS'*, corresponding to the four combinations of 
(/;(0 and (/^(f). 

In QPSK, due to the coincident alignment of rf/tO and dQ{t), the carrier 
phase can cliange only once every IT. The carrier pliase over any 2T interval 
is any one of tlie four phases shown in Fig. 5-5, depending on the pair of 
values for {d,{t), dgit)). In the next IT interval, if neither bit stream clianges 
sign, then the carrier phase remains the same. If one component (rf/(0 or

nents results in a pliase shift of 180". Figure 5-6(a) shows a typical QPSK 
signal wavelorni lor lite sample bit streams sliown in Fig, 5-3. 

In SQPSK, the binary components cannot change states simultaneously. 
One component has transitions in the middle of the other symbol and hence 
only one component can switch at a time. Tliis eliminates tiie possibility of 
180° phase changes. Furthermore, these changes arc limited to 0", *W°, every 
T seconds. F){;iirc 5-6(b) shows a typical SQPSK waveform for tlie example bit 
streams in Fig, 54. When an SQPSK signal undergoes band-limiting, the result- 
ing intersymbot interference causes the envelope to droop slightly in the 
region of 9Q° phase transitions. Since 180* phase transitions iiave been 
avoided, the envelope docs not go to zero as it does in the band-limited QPSK 
case. 

The advantages of QPSK or SQPSK over BPSK is tliat. witli both data rate 
and power being fixed, QPSK or SQPSK achieve tiie same power efficiency as 
BPSK using only half the bandwidth.

With {symmetrical bandpass Gaussian noise, tiie inpliase and quadrature 
noise terms are independent and the bit error probability performance of 
QPSK is the same as that of RPSK. 

Since the phase chutiges in SQPSK occur in smaller step sizes than in 
QPSK, SQPSK would lend to sul'lcr less degradation due to bandpass filtering 
than QPSK.

5.2.3 Description of the Subcarrier Demodulation Assembly (SDA) 

This section lollows tlic treatment in [5-4] . Annther useful reference is 
[5-5]. 

The Subcarrier Demodulation Assembly (SDA) is an inlepra! part of the 
multiple mission telemetry system now incorporated in the DSN. The primary 
purpose of the SDA is to provide a demodulated noisy data stream to liie 
SSA for detection. Figure 5-1 shows wlierc the SDA fits into tJie overall 
conununications system. Its inputs are the received radio signal, at an inter- 
mediate frequency, and a phase-colierent reference, both of which are fur- 
nished by the receiver/exciter subsystem. The following is a brief simplified 
mathematical description of how the SDA works. 

Witli reference to Fig, 5-1. let the input to ;he subcarrier modulator be 
cl(t), the binary waveform representing the data bits; then the output of the 
nrndulator can be written as: 

clU) Sin o) / 



.Ti' 



where co^^, is 2ii limes the subcarrier frequency in rad/sec and Bin represents a 
square wave having tlie same zero crossings as sin W(,.f. Let both dU) and Sin 
have values of +1 or 1 (see (5,2-3)). The output of the carrier phase modu- 
lator can then be written as: 

V2? sin [oj^t + A(/(f ) Sill (^j] 

where oiq is the carrier angular frequency. A is tiie modulation index, which 
determines tlie pliase deviation of tlie modulation (compare witli (5.2-1); we

liavc set C, - A). Tliis sipjuil is tlion transniitleil (lirougli space and received by 
one 1)1' the DSN stations. The received sipnal is a replica of the transmitted 
signal witli the addition of noise and can he written as; 

\/Tl' sin [u)(,r + A(/(/) Bin to^,/ + 0] + n"(t) 

wiiere is an arbitrary phase -.m^k and it"(t) is the additive noise, 

Tlio receiver now translates this signal in Ireqiioncy to an interniediaie 
Ircquency (II') so that the IF signal passing to the SDA is jiisl: 

V77'sin [lA^jfJ + Aii(i) Sin oj^J + 0] + n\t) 

The receiver has a phase-locked loop (PLL) that tracks the frequency and 
phase of this sipnal and 'provides a reieretice sipnal to the SDA. which is 
phase-coherent with the received signal (see Chapter.?). Us torin is; 

sin [^ij.t ■•■ 0\ 

where d is the I'LL estimate of 0. The cosine version of this signal is sent to 
lire SDA._I'or the purpose of discussing the SDA, tlie assumption will be made 
that 0^0-0. Also the amplitude \/2J' is not important in the discussion, so it 
can he taken as unity. Thus, the two signals eniering tlie SDA from the 
receiver are: 

II" Sipnal; 

.i{t) = sin [o3j,,t + A(/(n Bin co^.f] + n\t) 

Coherent Reference; 

It is the goal of the SDA to take these two signals and furnish the following 
signal to the SSA; 

d{l) + H(r) 

The signal iit) can be rewritten in a more convenient Ibrm. First, expand- 
ing by a trigonometric identity, s(t) is (ignoring noise):

A hasic principle in coherent denuidiilatioii is the idea of traiisiatiiif' a

variously referred lo as lielerodyniiin, conversion, iiilxiiip, or phase detection,

With this basic principle, the operation of the SDA is more easily under- 
stood. Fisitre 5-S shows the present functionnl block diagram of the SDA in a 
simplified form. The Mark IV configuration is somewhat different, but fimc- 
tionally the same. The configuration sliown accomplislies two things siniul- 
laiieoi)sl>: 

(1) The data, (/(/), is colierently demodulated and sent twith noise) to llie 
SSA 

(2) A tracking loop provides the coherent reference needed for demodula- 
tion 

Note liiat item (0 depends on item (2). Moreover, in li\c type of tracking 
loop used in tlie SDA, an estimate of the data, d(t), is needed. Tims, item (2) 
depends on item (1), 

In explaining tlie loop operation, the assumption will be made tlial the 
loop is in lock, that is (see Fig. .S-8), 

r^it) = 5inw^/ (5.2-1.1) 

and also that the rest frequency of the vultape-controilcd oscillator (VCO) is 
equal to Ihc subcarrier frequency, co^^,. 

The upper branch of the loop provides tiie d.-xa demodulation. Ignoring 
noise, the output of tlie first multiplier is

5.2.4 Description of the Symbol Synchronizer Assembly (SSA) 

This section toltows the treatiueut iti [5-t>] . Auothev useful rel'etouce is 



.71 



The Symbol Synchroui/er Assembly (.SSA), which is p.irt of the Tolemetvy 
and Command Data Handling Subsystem, has two primary I'uticlions: (Dto 
delect uncoded data or. alternatively, to provide symbol intepiaiions ol' coded 
data and [2) lo provide the (iiuuiji or syuchroni/atioii needed to perform 
function OV While the SSA performs a number of other functions, (his sec- 
tion will be concerned Willi a description of how these two functions specifi- 
callv' are accomplished. 

Biiiar\ data (I's and O's) can be transmitted over an uncoded telemetry 
channel as the same sequence ol' I's and O's, which in this case ate called bits. 
If the data are coded by forminj; a different sequence, the I's and O's are 
called symbols, The bits (or symbols) are represented by a nuHlulatitip wave- 
form consisting of two levels, +.1 or .-l. as shown in I'ig, 5-<'tal. This sijiual 
waveform (r*-*frrred to as non-return to zero (NRZ) modulation) is transmitted 
on a radio frequency (RV) carrier and is demodulated (recovered) by the DSN 
receiver. The received waveform has been corrupted, however, with the addi- 
tion of luiise, as shown in Fig, 5-*Hb). The fimelion of the SSA is the extrac- 
tion of the oripiual signal waveform from this noisy waveform. It is lo be

emphasized tliat the SSA is configured to operate only on an NRZ data 
format. Thus tlie use of a Manchester code requires modification to tlie basic 

structure. 

To understand how the SSA recovers the desired bits, it is necessary to 
understand the method for detecting a single bit. This is accomplished by 
integrating the signal over tlie bit time and choosing a one if the integral is 
positive or a zero if the Integral is negative. This circuit is referred to as an 
"integrate and dump" circuit because it integrates for a bit time and then 
resets to zero at the end of each T second interval. Figure 5-10(a) shows the 
bit and its integral value at the end of (he T second integration. Fig- 
ure 5-10(b) shows tlie same decision made on a noisy signal. Figure 5-10(c) 
shows the noise being such that an error is made. 

Naturally, a communications link is designed such that the probability of 
noise-caused errors is low. This is accomplished by maintaining the signal level 
at a relatively high value compared to the noise level. One assumption that is 
made, however, is that the beginning of the bit must be known to start the 
integration properly. An example of integration over a bit time beginning 
before the actual start of the bit is shown in Fig. 5-1 1, where the "1" bit Is 
preceded by a "0" bit. The correct decision is made with no noise, but with a 
small amount of noise the probabiHly is great that the wrong decision will be 
made, as shown in Fig. 5-1 1(b). Thus, it can easily be seen that accurate time 
information as to the start of each bit is necessary to keep the probability of 
making an error as low as possible. This is the second function of the SSA; 
i.e., to provide bit (or symbol) synchronization to the data detector circuits.

is that can occur in the data stream. Naturally, the greater the transition 
density, the jvealer the ability of the loop to irai I, doppler rates. 

A final note is that this section iiives a functional description of the SSA', 
the actual mcchani/ation of the SSA functions described here is not as shown 
in Fip. 5'\2. The synchronizinp loop is in I'act a hybrid desipn of both dipital 
and analop components and functions. Also, the SSA performs a number of 
other functions no* described here. 



5.3 Uncoded Phase-Shift-Keying Telemetry System 
Performance 

The performance of a dipital telemetry sysiem is measured as a bit error 
probability, A^, or bit error rate (BER). The BER, in turn, depends on the 
bit enerpy-to-noise spectral density ratio I'-iy/N^ and the inefficiencies of tiie 
den'odulatlon/detection process. The bit energy-to-noise spectral density ratio 
is defined as 

AyA'o = J^i (5.3-0 

where 

.V = received data power 
A'o = one-sided noise spectral density 

R " information bit rate 

The demodulation/detection inefficiencies are dominated by the imperfection 
Willi which the receiver achieves carrier, subcarrier, and symbol synchroni- 
zation. 

If one assumes no demodulation/detection inefficiencies (implying perfect 
carrier, subcarrier. and symbol syncluoni/ation at the receiver), the resulting 
functional dependence of the bit error probability, /),, upon 1'-i,INq is termed 
the baseline performance. In this chapter the baseline performance is frequently 
denoted by/(*): 

P, = f(l'-,IN,) (5.3-2) 

Of course, /(•) is different for different coding/modulation schemes. In some 
c.ises (see, for example, subsection 5.3.1), /(•) can be determined theoreti- 
cally. Otherwise, /(•) must be determined by simulation or a combination of

simulation and theory. In all cases, the channel is modeled as additive white 
Ciaussian an excellent model for the deep-space channel, 

5.3,1 One-Way Telemetry Performance 

In this section, the baseline performance /(•) is found for the case of no 
error-correctinp coding and no differential encoding, i.e., the uncoded case. 
The performance of a receiver for a binary digital signal depends on the 
pliase-eoherence of the receiver and the type of modulation employed at tlie 
transmitter. A transmitted signal is expressed as 

j^{0 - /I^{/) sin [tO(,/ + m^(/) + 0(t)\ . < r < 7;, k = 1.2 

(5.3-3) 

where 7'^ is the symbol period, cOq is llie signal frequency, and /l^Cr) and 
tti/^it) are determined by the modulation scheme, whereas the ability oi' the 
receiver to track 0{t} is a measure of its coherence. 

Tlie received waveform at the receiver, with additive noise «;('), is 

v(0 - Sf^U) + n^it) 

The optimum detector with minimum error probability is a matched filter, or 
correlation detector. It is this type of detector that is employed by the Deep 
Space Network (DSN) to detect vransmitted data. (For discussions of matched 
filter detection, see [5-8) and [5-9]). This correlfititin operation can be per- 
formed by a multiplier-integrator combination with readout at time / = T^ 
where T^ is the duration of the kth transmitted symbol, or by a matched 
filter with readout at f = T^. A functional diagram of a coherent correlation 
detector for binary signals that uses a carrier reference for detection is illus- 
trated in Fig, 5-14, where both the perfect reference and the noisy reference 
cases are included. This detector model is predicated on the assumption that 
each transmitter symbol is equally likely, and that eacii symbol has equal 
energy. 

The energy of each symbol out of the detector is li^. A measure of the 
correlation of the two signals is the normalized inner product

5.4 Channel Coding and Coded Telemetry System 
Performance 

The goal of the channel encoder and decoder is to map the input digital 
sequence into a channel input sequence, and, conversely, the cliannei output 
sequence into an output digital sequence, such that the effect of the channel 
noise is minimized- that is, such that the number of discrepancies (errors) 
between the output and input digital sequences is minimized. Tlie approacii is 
to introduce redundancy with the channel encoder and to use this redundancy 
at the decoder to reconstitute the input sequence as accurately as possible. 
Therefore, if an efficient code is selected and a good decoding scheme is used, 
we may require for a given bit error rate and a given data rate less ST,JN^ 
than if t!ie data is transmitted uncoded. 

For a treatment of channel coding that is more nearly complete than that 
given in this section, the reader should consult [5-11] through [5-19]. 

5.4.1 Types of Codes 

The encoder of Fig. 5-17 accepts at its input a continuous sequence of 
information digits. At its output, it produces another sequence with somewhat 
more digits, which is fed to the modulator. The decoder accepts a sequence of 
cliannel symbols from the demodulator and translates it into a somewhat 
shorter sequence of information digits. The rules under which the encoder and 
decoder operate are specified by the particular code that is employed. 

There are two fundamentally different types of codes. Tlie encoder for a 
block code breaks the continuous sequence of information digits into 
K-synibol sections or blocks. It then operates on these blocks independently 
according to the particular code to be employed. With each possible informa- 
tion block is associated an A'-tuple of channel symbols, where N>K. The 
result, now called a code word, is transmitted, corrupted by noise, and 
decoded independently of ail other code words. The quantity N is referred to 
as the code length or block length.

Tlic other type of code, called a tree code, operates on liie information 
sequence witiiout bre.:king it up into independent blocks. Rather, the encoder 
for 11 tree code processes the information continuously and associates each 
long (perhaps semi-inrmite) information sequence with a code sequence con- 
taining somewhat more digits. The encoder breaks its input sequence into 
6-symboi blocks, where h is usually a small number. Then, on the basis of this 
t-luple and the preceding information symbols, it emits an /i-symbol section 
of the code sequence. The name "tree code" stems from the fact that the 
encoding rules for this type of code are most conveniently described by means 
of a tree graph. 

The class of amvoluthmal codes forms a subset of tlie class of tree codes. 
These cades arc important since they are simpler to implement than other 
types of tree codes. In this book the convolutional codes are tlie only tree 
codes considered. 

Block codes and convolutional codes have similar error-correct',/ ig capabili- 
ties and the same fundamental limitations. In particular, Shannon's funda- 
mental theorem for the discrete noisy channel holds for both types of codes. 
This result states that a channel has a well-defined capacity and that by using 
suitable codes it is possible to transmit information at any rate less than 
channel capacity with an arbitrarily small probability of decoding erroneously. 

Since the appearance of Shannon's classic papers^ in 1948 and 1949, a 
great deal of research has been devoted to the problem of designing efficient 
schemes by which information can be coded for reliable transmission across 
channels that arc corrupted by noise.

ment Taihire. The complete decoding procedures can be perlorined on the eartii, 
where equipment limitations are not severe. 

5.4.2 Linear Block Codes 

Block encoding can also be regarded as a table-look-up operation, where 
each of the At - q^ {if is tlie alphabet si/e of information symbols) code signal 
vectors x, , Xj,---, x^ is stored in an A'-stage rcpieter of a memory bank 
and, whenever message ii,,, is to be iransniitled, the corresponding signal 
vector x,„ is read into the modulator, Alternatively, we may label each of the 
M = <}^ messages, as in I'ig. 5-17, by a A'-vcctor over a (/-ary alphabet. Then 
the encoding becomes a one-to-one mapping Irom the set of message vectors 
i"(H " t",„i . ■ ■ ■ . i'mK '^ i"'" the set of code signal vectors i\„, = (.v,„, . • ■ ■ . 
.v,„Y )}. We shall concern ourselves primarily with binary alphabets, i.e., (/ = 2; 
thus, initially, we take »,„„ c {0, !} for all ;»,». 

I'or binary-input data, a linear code con&ists simply of a set of modulo-2 
linear combinations of the data symbols, which may be implemented as shown 
in Fig. .^-Iti. The A.'.stagc register stores the A' incoming informalion bits that 



correspond to data block u„, - {^l^

is also d code vector. An interesting consequence of tiie closure property is 
that the sot of Hamming distances from a given code vector to the {M~ 1) 
other code vectors is the same for all code vectors. Define the Hammitig 
weight of a binary vector as the number of ones in tlie vector. The Hamming 
distance between two vectors x,„ and x^ is then just the Hamming weight of 
their nioduIo-2 tcrmwise sum, denoted w(x„, <!' Xj^). The minimum distance of 
a code is the minimum (Hamming) distance between its codewords. Minimum 
distance is an important parameter of a hnear code.

it minimizes the probability of the decoder making a mistake, and is called

The optimum decoding procedure is outlined below. 

Step 1 - Initially prior to decoding, for each of the 2'*'"'' possible syn- 
dromes s, store the corresponding minimum weight vector e satis- 
fying (5.4-11), below. A tabic of 2^-"''' Mbit entries will result. 

e^'^ = s (5.4-11) 



Step 2 - From the /V-dimensional received vector y, generate the (N~1C)- 
dimensional syndrome s by tlie linear operation (5.4-10); this 
requires an TV-stage register and N~ K modulo-2 adders. 

Step 3 -Do a table look-up in the table of Step to obtain S = e corre- 
sponding to the syndrome s found from Step 2. 

Step 4 -Obtain the most likely code vector by the operation x,„ =y ^e. 
The first symbols are tlie data symbols. 



Denote the minimum Hamming distance among all pairs of codewords by 
d,„j,.. For the maximum likelihood decoder on the BSC outlined above, any 
number of errors in a given block that is less than d,„y„/2 will be corrected. 



S.4.2.3 Examples of linear block codes. Many linear bloik codes have been 
devised. In what follows we consider two particular block codes that have 
recently been employed for the deep-space channei-Golay and Reed-Solomon 
codes, 

The reader interested in block codes and tiie algebraic theory bclUnd block 
codes may wish to consult [5-21] through [5-29] as a supplement to the 
general coding references cited earlier. 

5.4,2.3.1 Golay codes. Two linear block codes, the Golay (23, 12) and 
(24, 12) codes, have minimum distances equal to 7 and 8 respectively. The 
Golay (23, 12) is called a perfect code and Golay (24,12) a quasi-perfect 
code. The Golay (24, 12) code is used more often than (23, 12) for various 
reasons including its slightly better performance on the AWGN channel. The 
Golay (24, 12) code is capable of correcting all patterns of three or fewer bit 
errors. It is known that the parity-check matrix of the (24, 12) Golay code 
may be written as

appropriate on burst noisy channels such as a cliannel consisting of a convolu-

5.4.3 Convolutional Codes 

A constraint length A', code rate r = bjn (bits/symbol) convolutional 
encoder is a linear nnite-stale machine consisting of a iA-stago shift register 
and » linear algebraic function generators (Fig. 5-20), The input data, which is 
usually binary, is shifted at a bit rate of llT^ along the register b bits at a 
time. The output symbol rate is equal to l(T^= (rT"^)"' . In comparison to 
block codes, convolutional codes encode tlie input data bits continuously 
ratiier than in blocks. The convolutional encoder implementation is simpler 
and liius less costly and more reliable for spacecraft operation tlian a block 
encoder. A {b, n) linear block code can be regarded as a special case of a 
convolutional code witli K= I.

The particular code structure depends on the manner In which the adders 
are connected to the sliift register. Tiiese connections are denoted by a set of 
vectors

where gfj = 1 denotes a connection between the /th stage of the shift register 
and the / tli adder, and gjj = denotes the absence of a connection. The 
complete set of g^ and the parameter b define the code. Figure 5-21 demon- 
strates the meaning of g,. 

If the data bits are sent as part of tlie output, the code is termed "sys- 
tematic." Otherwise, it is "nonsystematic." Thus, a systematic code is one 
wiiich for some i < / ^ h and < m < /i^ - b (usually / = 1 and m = 0)

Some of the code structures are transparent to code inversion-that is, if 
tlie signs of the input bits are reversed, tire coded output bit sequence is 
simply inverted. Thus, if tlie numbers of "ones" or vveiglits of all g/s are odd, 
then the code is transparent to a sign inversion. That is, the decoded output 
bit stream has the same sign ambiguity as the input. Tliis transparency is 
valuable if bjphasc-modulated PSK is used with its ensuing sign ambiguity, for 
it permits decoding prior to ambiguity removal. 



In deep-space telecommunication, data-derived symbol synchronization, 
rather than a separate synchronization channel, is used. Inverting alternate 
symbols of a convolutional encoder output provides sufficient density of 
symbol transitions to guarantee adequate symbol synchronizer performance, a 
guarantee otherwise lacking. Altiiough alternate symbol inversion may increase 
or decrease the average transition density, depending on the data source 
model, it does limit the number of contiguous symbols without transition for 
a particular class of convolutional codes, independent of the data source 
model- Further, this limit is sufficiently small to guarantee acceptable symbol 
synchronizer performance for typical applications. Subsequent inversion of 
alternate defected symbols permits proper decoding. In Fig, 5-22, two NASA 
Planetary Standard constraint length 7, convolutional codes with code rates 
1/2 and 1/3 and symbol inverters are shown. The maximum number of contig- 
uous symbols without transition for the 1/2 and 1/3 code-rates of the con- 
volutional codes of Fig. 5-23 are 14 and 12, respectively. 



Before turning to the subject of decoding convolutional codes, wc call 
[5-2], [5-3], and [5-30] through [5-32] to the reader's attention. These 
references, along with the general coding references cited earlier, are a repre- 
sentative cross section of the hterature on the subject of convolutional codes. 



5.4,3,1 Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes. In this subsection we con- 
sider the performance of Viterbi decoders, including the effect of noisy carrier 
reference. For discussions on the design of Viterbi decoders, the reader should 
consult Appendix A and [5-33] and [5-34], 



The Viterbi Algorithm decoder of the Standard NASA K = l,r= 1/2 con- 
volutional codes with 8-level (3-bit) quantization is called the Maximum Like- 
lihood Convolutional Decoder (MCD). For the MCD the probability of bit 
error baseline (tiiat is, with perfect carrier reference) has been determined by 
simulation. If /(•) denotes the probability of bit error, then, according to 
[5-52] and [5-53]

line case, we iiave .v^ = EJNq. Tliis model has been compared with two sets 
of experimental data and shown to yield excellent agreement, as illustrated in 
Fig. 5-24. 

A modification to llie use of this model for computing bit error probability 
performance over channels with carrier tracking was suggested in [5-53]. 
Basically tliis modification accounts for the effect of symbol stream inversion 
when llie absolute value of tlie carrier tracking phase-locked loop phase error 
is between ?r/2 and n. Since in a bipliase suppressed carrier system with 
perfectly resolved ambiguity this cannot occur [see (5.G-23)], then the above 
modification is unnecessary.

number of wrnng hypotheses and moves aliead anyway. Tiie probability asso- 
ciated with tills event is called the undetected error probability or the bit 
error probability. Tlie second, called a buffer overflow, occurs when the num- 
Dcr of computations permitted per frame'' is exceeded. In this case, tiie frame 
cannot be decoded, and is considered an erased or deleted frame. The fre- 
quency with which this event happens is called the frame deletion probability 
or frame erasure probability. At this point, tlie decoder is forced into a 
resynchronization mode, and until the decoder is again decoding normally, 
uncorrected data are delivered to the user, containing tl\e original channel 
errors. 

Currently, for the Deep Space Network (DSN), decoding is possible for 
either of the two encoding implementation configurations shown in Figs. 5-38 
and 5-39, 

The convolutional codes, v/hicli are sequentially decoded, typically have a 
large enough consii'ainl lengtii so that the undetected error probability of the 
decoder is negligible compared to the probability that a block cannot be 
successfully decoded in the time allowed. Thus tiie limiting factor for sequen- 
tial decoding is the probability that large amounts of computation are 
required to decode a frame of the code, rather than the probability of error. 
Thus, in this part we only consider the effects of noisy carrier reference on 
deletion probability, although the results can easily be extended to undetected 
error probability with the same procedure that is going to be used for deter- 
mining deletion piobability, 

5.4.3.2.1 Sequential decoding with noisy carrier reference: high-rate model. 
Before going to the derivation of the effect of a noisy carrier on deletion 
(erasure) probability, wc siiould note two facts. The first fact is that whenever 
the number of computations needed to decode a code frame is large, its 
distribution is dominated by single long computations, representing decoder 
penetration from node level /- / to /, for some /, /. The second fact is that 
whenever the number of computations is small, the distribution function 
represents the sum of many small computations. 

Now, for higii-data-rate systems, if tlie ratio fi = Rjl Bj^ is very large, where 
Bj^ is the phase-locked loop bandwidth and R is the data symbol rate, then it 
is reasonable to assume that the phase error is essentially constant over a 
frame of data. Thus, in tiiis situation we can average the deletion probability 
curves conditioned on bit SNR (which depends on phase error 0) over the 
distribution of the phase error, to derive an estimate of decoding performance

The RS code is nonbiliary. An RS symbol consists of a sequence of / bits 
so that there are 2^ possible RS symbols. All coding and decoding operations 
involve RS symbols, not individual bits.

symbols, of wliich the first 2'' - (1 + 2£) are tlie same symbols as those 
entering to tiie left. This makes the code systematic. The remainder of the 
codeword is filled in with 2E parity symbols. An RS symbol Is in error if any 
of tlie J bits making up the symbol are in error. E represents tlie number of 
correctable RS symbol errors in an RS codeword. That is, if E or less RS 
symbols are in error in any way, the decoder will be capable of correcting 
them. 



251 



OF POOR QUA^-rn 

We put attention on tlie specific system witia /=8, £"=16. Tlie basic 
codeword structure of this specific codeword witli 7 = 8, J? = 16, is given in 
Fig. 5-47. Note tliat tlie overlread associated witli tlw parity symbols is only 
around 15 percent. If desired, a "quick looli" at the data (information bits) 
would still be possible since the code is systematic. Typically, the inner con- 
volutional code corrects enough errors so that a high-code-rate outer code can 
reduce the error probability to the desired level. 

The interleaving buffers are required because the inner Viterbi decoder 
errors tend to occur in bursts, which occasionally are as long as several con- 
straint lengths. Without interleaving, Viterbi decoder burst error events would 
tend to occur within one RS codeword. That one codeword would have to 
correct all of these errors. Thus over a period of lime there would be u 
tendency for some codewords to have "too many" errors to correct (i.e., greater 
tlian 16). 

Figure 5-48 [5-41] illustrates two interleaver methods with an encoder 
code array of / RS codewords (for / levels of interleaving). The figure gives 
the sequence for reading and writing symbols from interleavers represented by 
the code array. Interleaver B has the advantage that ail of tlie data symbols of 
the code array do not have to be stored before the symbols can be trans- 
mitted to the convolutiona! encod'5r. However, when an RS word error is 
made, it will, in general, cause more source block errors than interleaver A. 
The purpose of interieaving and de-interleaving is to make the RS symbol 
errors, at the input of the RS decoder, independent of each other and to 
distribute the RS symbol errors uniformly; in other words, to distribute the

Fig, 5-46. Encoder code array representation of interleaving metliods 

burst errors out of the Viterbi decoder among several codewords. The perfor- 
mance of the RS decoder is severely degraded by higlily correlated errors 
among several successive symbols. 

The level of interleaving / corresponds to the number of RS codewords 
involved in the interleaving and de-interleaving operation. Interleaving and 
de-interleaving operations over a channel can be explained simply by consider- 
ing two / X 2'' - 1 matrices, one at the input of tlie channel and one at the 
output (see Fig. 548). For interleaving, put the codeword with lengtli 2'' - 1 
in rows J, 2, • ■ • , / r)f the matrix, tlien transmit the symbols of columns i, 
2, • • • , 2-'^- 1 through the channel. For de-interleaving, do the reverse opera- 
tion. For the Rced-Solomon code (255, 223), simulation results have shown 
that the interleaving level of /= 16 is adequate for making the RS symbol 
errors independent of each other. Thus, hencefortli we can assume that the 
interleaving, convolutional code, AWGN channel, Viterbi decoder, and 
de-interleaving in tandem create an equivalent 2''^-ary Discrete Memoryless 
Channel (DMC) with transition error probability ir. 

In decoding the RS codewords, essentially three events may happen. The 
first event happens if there are E or less RS symbol errors in a codeword. In 
this case tlie decoder successfully corrects the errors and outputs the correct 
information block. The second event happens if tlie number of RS symbol 



253 



ORSGtMAL P/iC^ !'■ 

OF POOR QUALSYi^ 
errors in a codeword are more than E but the corrupted codeword is not close to 
any other codeword witliin the distance of E symbols. In tliis case the RS 
decoder fails to decode and outputs tlie fust 2^ -■ \ -2E undecoded informa- 
tion symbols that may contain symbol errors. The third event happens if the 
number of RS symbol errors in a codeword is more than £', and the corrupted 
codeword is closer to some other codeword witiiin the distance of i' symbols. 
In tliis case the decoder is fooled, decodes incorrectly, and outputs a wrong 
information bloclc. In other words, it claims the decoded block as a correct 
one and by doing this it may add up to E more symbol errors to the decoded 
output. Fortunately for most of the RS codes of interest with large alphabet 
size, in particular for the (255. 223) RS code, the probability tliat the third 
event happens is very small [5-47] . lis probability has very little effect on 
the error probability performance of an RS code in the range of interest. In 
[547] it has been shown that the probability of the third event, i.e., an incor- 
rect decoding event, is less than 10"'^, Therefore, for tlie practical range of 
interest in error probability performance, it almost surely can be assumed that 
only the first and second events happen. 

5.4.4. 1 Error performance. 

(1) RS codeword error probability; 

Denote tlie word errt-r probability for an (A', K) RS code by P^JJ^, E). 
An RS codeword is in error wlien there are more than E channel 
symbol errors in a received codeword y. Therefore, we should consider 
all combinations of /' symbol errors within tt\e 2-^ - 1 symbol, for all 
l>E. 

The RS codeword error probability is (see also [5-41]) 

N 
PJN,E) = /'(x„, ^xj = Y, (^) '^^(l " ^)''~' (5.4-37) 

where tt is the RS decoder input symbol error probability; i.e., n is 
the probability for one or more bit errors occurring in a string of J 
consecutive bits. For the experimentally determined statistics of ir with 
a non-noisy carrier reference, the resulting RS word error probability is 
sliown in Fig. 5-49. 

(2) RS information-block error probability; 

Note that if a codeword is in error it is not necessary that the corre- 
sponding information block be in error. This error probability is unpor- 
tant for source coding (data compression). Denote the information- 
block error probability by Pj. Based on our assumptions, we should 
subtract the probability of all possible patterns of symbol errors that

(3) RS symbol error probability (out of the RS decoder): 

Denote the RS symbol error probability by P^. When the RS decoder 
fails to decode, tlie symbol error pattern is exactly (he same at the 
input and output of the RS decoder. Now, in order that an output RS 
symbol at, say, position k, k= \, 2,- ■ • , 2'' - 1 - 2/^ be in error, the 
input RS symbol at the sa.ne position k should be in error. In addi- 
tion, tliere should be i? or greater input RS symbol errors in the 
remaining A' - 1 symbols of the receivid codewords out of the Vilerbi 
decoder, i.e., other than at the position k. Ttie probability that the 
input RS symbol at position k be in error is w. The probability that 
there will be t: or more input RS symbol errors in the remaining 
positions, i.e., A'^- 1 places of received codeword, is

Thus

(4) RS bit error probability; 

Denote the RS bit error rate by Pi,(RS). In order that a bit at, say, 
position m, m=\, 2, • • • , / within the RS output symbol at, say, 
position A:, A;= 1, 2, • ■ - , 2''^- 1 - 24? be in error, the bit at tlie posi- 
tion m within the input RS symbol at position k of an uncoded code- 
word sliould be in error and there should be E or more RS symbol 
errors in the received codeword out of the Viterbi decoder in m other 
position than k. But tlie probability that a bit would be in error in an 
undecoded RS codeword is the bit error rate of tlie Viterbi decoder 
denoted by Pj,{Vlterbi). The probability that there are E or more RS 
symbol errors in an undecoded codeword in positions otlier than k is 
given by (5.440). Thus, the RS bit error probability is [547]

5.4.4.2 A functional model for the RS decoder iniSut-sylnbdl error probability.

where /(«) is the system's bit error probability as a function of bit SNR in tiie 
case of perfect carrier tracking. Of course, /(■) will depend on the particular 
modulation, coding, and decoding schemes used. 

In general, the carrier phase, the subcarrier phase, and tlie symbol and 
word timing references are not derived perfectly at the DSS. Under these 
circumstances, it is necessary to define telemetry system loss % as

with suppressed carrier systems can also be applied here to obtain good approxi- 
mate results for these losses. The carrier and subcarrier synchronization (sync) 
are tite principal source of performance degradation in deep space telecom- 
munications. The further deterioration of performance, due to the lack of 
perfect sync information such as symbol, word, and frame sync, is negligible 
relative to the carrier and subcarrier sync in most applications. 

5.5.1 Radio Loss 

When only the carrier phase is imperfectly derived at the DSS, the telem- 
etry bit error probability Pj,{fi) conditioned on the carrier phase tracking error 
is

where T = detector integration time. (f>(t) is a stochastic process whose proba- 
bility density [5-10] (see also Chapter 3) is given in (5.3-18). 

At litis point, three cases must be distinguished: low data rate, higit data 
rale, and medium data rate. For coded communication systems, in order to 
determine whether a lu'gli-, medium-, or low-data-rate model should be used, 
one should consider the phase error dynamics (how fast it Is changing) and 
tlie time it takes to decode one bit. For our discussion here, the use of a data- 
rate-to-carrier tracking-loop bandwidtli ratio Is sufficient to illustrate these three 
cases. 

5.5.1.1 Radio loss— low-data-rate case. If the data-rate-to-carrier tracking-loop 
bandwidth is low enough that 0(r) varies rapidly during time T, then the 
following low-rate approximation is appropriate.

bit syncliranizers. 

The most common form of data-derived symbol sync is wliere the receiver 
inckides a device that extracts the sync directly from the information-bearing 
signal- The principal advantage of extracting sync from the data-bearing signal 
is that no additional power expenditure and frequency spectrum arc required. 
Thus, all the transmitter sideband power is available to tha data and sync 
signals simultaneously. Hence symbol sync and detection loss is generally very 
small. Fn deep space telecommunications systems, it is usually less than 
0.1 dB.

In Section 3.2 of Chapter 3, we considered tlie phase tracking performance 
of various suppressed carrier synchronization loops corresponding to BPSK, 
QPSK, and UQPSK modulations. The measure of performance used in each 
case was the mean-square phase jitter caused by the presence of thermal noise 
at the receiver front end. The purpose here is to tie together these mean- 
square phase jitter results with their degrading effect on system error probaWl-

Tlie result for P^, in (S.O-S) was obtained by expandinp i't,{<t>) of (5.()-2) in a 
Maclautin (power) series in <!>, keeping only terms of second order or lower 
and using {5.C)'5) rather than (5,h-.') to perform the a'qiiired avcriiging over 0. 
t-quatton (5.(i-3) is in a highly desirable form I'rom the standpoint of compu- 
tation in that it avoids the necessity of numerical integration and, in addition, 
clearly isolates the degradation due to the imperfect carrier syuchroid/ation 
reference. 

An important point to note is that even if a. were to be held constant as 
^ V'^'o ^'"^''■'''' >-'valualion of (5.0-2) or (5.()-5) does not result in an irreducible 
bit error probability as occurs in discrete carrier receivers. The principal reason 
for this is that liere is restricted to lie in the region (- 7r/2, jt/2) insofar as 
tlie evaluation of (5.ti-2) is concerned. Thus cos is always positive, and 
hence, for any in (his interval, eric (y/l<iJf^o cos 0) will approach zero as 
l''jJ!^Q iipproaclies inlinity. Certainly since, as previously mentioned, 0. is not 
constant as {•■iJI^'q, the plot of /^(, versus A'(,/iVo will be even sleeper yet.

5.6.2 Bit Error Probability Performance of QPSK In the Presence of

In tlje absence of carrier sync error, the average bit error probability per-

presence of carrier fync error and the high- data-rate assumption made pre-

5.6.5 Bit Error Probability Performance of Convolutionally Coded 
UQPSK in the Presence of Carrier Sync Error 

In this section we compute the performance of convolutionally coded 
UQPSK in the presence of a noisy carrier reference, using a Costas loop for 
carrier tracking. A block diagram of this coded UQPSK system is depicted in 
Fig. 5-69. 

Let fft'jN^), /■= 1,2, be the bit error probability of a convolutionally 
coded/Viterbi-decoded channel with a perfect carrier reference. For deep-space 
communication, n (5.6-18), the ratio of the liigli-data-rate channel (Cliannel 2) 
to tlie low-data-rate cliannel (Clianncl I) is usually large, say n>2Q, And the 
data rates of both Channels 1 and 2 are much greater than the suppressed 
carrier tracking loop bandwidth. Thus, the bit error probabilities of the two 
channels [5-54] are

gain (including AGC and suppression factors), Oj- is tlie one-sided loop band- 
width, and Sj^ is the Costas loop squaring loss (see Chapter 3), Here \ye are 
able to use the squaring loss derived for the uncoded case because we deal 
with uncortelated convolutional codes [S-SS] and the performance of tiie 
Costas loop depends only on the second order statistics of the signal stream. 
Hence, iincorrclatcd code symbols mean independent code symbols.

Uirough (5.6-29) in (5.6-25), we obtain tlie bit error probabilities of the higli- 
rate and low-rate channels; these are illustrated in Figs. 5-70 and S-71, respec- 
tively. Figure 5-72 plots tlie bit error probabilities of botli channels vs the total 
received power-to-noise spectral density ratio for various values of doppler 
frequency offset. 

5.6.6 Direct Evaluation of Noisy Reference Loss 

Often one is interested in directly computing the additional bit energy-to- 
noise ratio required in the presence of a noisy synchronization reference to 
produce tlic same error probability as the perfectly synchronized system. This 
additional bit energy-to-noise ratio is referred to as the noisy reference loss for 
the specified error probability and vi such represents a horizontal displace- 
ment of a given point on tlie ideal performance error probability vs the bit 
energy-to-noise ratio curve (sec Fig. 5-73). In mathematical terms, letting tj 
denote the dB equivalent of A'^Z/Vq, tlien at tlic particular bit error probability 
P}^ , the noisy reference loss (in dB) denoted by A, would be given by 



"0 



A = i)o - 7);^ (5.6-30) 



Unfortunately, the approximate relations of (5.6-5), (5.6-8), and (5.6-15) 
give us the additional error probability at a given bit encrg}'-to-noise ratio 
caused by tlie synchronization reference being imperfect; i.e., a vertical dis-

5.7 Effect of Doppler on Telemetry Performance 

The uncompensated doppler shift of the downlink produces a doppler 
stress in tlie receiver. Stated mathematically, the phase error has a nonzero 
mean [5-10]. Of course, this means a performance degradation to the telem- 
etry channel. In this section, the performances of an uncoded (subsection 
5.7,1) and a convolutionaliy coded (subsection 5.7.2) telemetry channel 
operating with doppler-stressed receivers are considered. Both theoretical and 
simulation approaches are taken, and tlie results from distinct approaches 
compared. This section follows the treatment in [5-56]. Only the Iiigh-data- 
rate case, which is the one of mos,' practical interest under this situation, is 
discussed.

to Figs. 5-74 through 5-76, respectively) and seven curves of constant loop 
SNR were plotted (p = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 dB). For reference, base- 
band bit error probability versus /iyA'o was also plotted in each figure. Base- 
band bit error probability for an uncoded channel is given by (5.3-1 1). Radio 
loss at a selected probability of bit error may bo determined from these plots 
by taking the difference (in I'-hlN^) between t!ie baseband curve and a

phase error was selected ((p^ = 5, 10, and 20 degrees corresponding to Figs. 5-77 
tlirougli 5-79, respectively) and seven curves of constant loop SNR were plotted 
(p = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 dB). For reference, baseband bit error prob-

obtained by replacing the theoretical probability density function pi4>) of the 
loop phase error witli one derived from computer simulation of the RF 
receiver phase-locked loop. As the "bin" size for forming the histogram during 
the computer simulation was 0.1 degree, the maximum quantization error was 
±0.05 degree, and the probability density function derived from the computer 
simulation will have the form

between 179.95° and 180°, and it,goo is the fraction of the time that the

The computer simulation of the RF receiver numerically solves the differ- 
ential equations for (he loop phase error ip(t) for a phase-locked loop driven 
by the normalized noise process it{t). For convenience, the differential equa- 
tions are expressed in state variable form. Thus, according to [5-10] ,

and five curves of constant loop static phase error were plotted (0 = 0, 5, 10. 
15, and 20 degrees). Tiie curves were plotted using (5,3-15) (with appropriate 
substitutions for Pi,{<l)) from f5,7-3) and for p(0) from (5.7-2)), and provide 
bit error probability as a function of KfjlN^. For reference, baseband bit error 
probability versus E^IN^ was also plotted in each fiBurc, using (5.7-6). Tiie 
simulation data are indicated on these plots by symbols. A unique symbol is 
used to identify each of the five loop static phase errors considered. Note that 
all three figures show good agreement betwein the theoretical curves and the 
simulation results. Agreement improves with increased loop signal-to-noise 
ratio (/j), and witli decreased F-JNq. Perturbations in tlie simulation results 
for bit error rates less than 10"^ are probably due to too few trials per 
simulation point. 



5.8 Arrayed System 

There are two types of arraying pertinent to the DSN: baseband combining 
and carrier arraying. Baseband combining is the combining at baseband of 
received telemetry streams from several geographically separated DSSs, The 
purpose of baseband combining is to improve overall bit error rate perfor- 
mance. Carrier arraying is the combining at RF of received carrier signals from 
several geographically separated DSSs, Tlie purpose of carrier arraying is to 
improve overall carrier loop SNR. 

5.8.1 Baseband Combining 

Wlien baseband cornbinhig is the only arraying tcclmiquc being used, the 
arrayed system configuration Is as diagramed in Fig, 5-83. 

As indicated in Fig. 5-83, the baseband signal from each DSS must be 
properly delayed and weighted, to ensure optimum combining, if ^(,//A'o; 
denotes the energy-per-bit-to-noisc spectral density ratio foi the ; th station in 
the array, then the optimum weighting factor j3y for the /th station is given by

For each Sj^^, ; store r(Sj^() and the corresponding survivor t(s^^.,); sot 
k ia k + I and repeat until k = L. 

With finite state sequence s, tlie algorithm terminates at time L with the 
shortest complete path stored as the survivor s(sj^). 

In summary, a Viterbi decoder calculates the length (likelihood or metric) 
of each of the 2'' paths entering a given state and, except for the most likely 
(shortest length) path, eliminates from further consideration all paths that lead 
to that state. This is done for each of 2'''^^'""') states at a given trellis depth; 
after each decoding operation only one path remains leading to each state. 
The decoder then moves one level deeper into the trellis and repeats the 
process. 

The great advantage of the Viterbi maximum-likelihood decoder is that the 
number of decoder operations performed in decoding/, bits is only L2''^^~^\ 
which is linear in L. Of course, Viterbi decoding as a practical technique is 
limited to relatively shorl-constraint-tength codes due to the exponential 
dependence of decoder operations, per decoded bit, on K.

Appendix B 
Sequential Decoding 

The complejdty of tlie Viterbi algoritiim is an exponential function of tlie 
code's constraint length K. A decoding algorithm tliat will worli on convolu- 
tional codes with very large values of K is needed, Tliere is a class of such 
algorithms, called sequential decoding algorithms, They are not quite as good 
as muximum-likeliliood algoritlims for a fixed code, but that defect is largely 
compensated for by the fact that they can be used to decode some codes with 
lery large A'. 

The key to understanding sequential decoding algorithms is the tree dia- 
gram. In a shift register encoder for a b/ti convolutional code, b information 
bits entering the decoder cause n encoded bits to leave. Thus it is possible to 
view the encoding process conceptually as a walk through a tree, as depicted 
in Fig. B-1 {&= 1, n = 2). 

The encoder begins at the INITIAL node and after / inputs it will be at 
some node in the tree at depth /. If the next input is "0", it moves to depth 
/+ 1 along the branch in the upward direction; if it is "1", in the downward 
direction "or example, if the input is OUCO • • • , the encoder wil' follow the 
path (solid line) indicated in Fig. B-1, In general, each branch of the tree will 
be labeled with the n bits tlie encoder will output as it travels the branch. The 
tree in Fig. B-1 apparently extends to infinite depth, but for any concrete 
realization of a code the tree will be finite. If the Ath truncation of the code 
is being used, the tree will terminate at depth L + K~ 1; and beyond depth 
L - 1 there will be no bifurcation of tiie paths, since the last K- I inputs to 
the encoder will always be "0". Figure B-1 is the completely labeled tree 
corresponding to the code of Fig. A-1. A code sequence is a path througli the 
tree. The encoding operation can be viewed as a process in wliich the encoder 
traces a particular patli through the code tree according to the instructions of 
the input message blocks. Conversely, the decoding operation may be regarded 
as a process in which the decoder, based on the received sequence and the 
channel statistics, attempts to retrace the transmitted path through the code 
tiee. 

From this viewpoint, each transmitted sequence corresponds to a path 
tlirough the tree, beginning at tlte INITIAL node and ending at depth 
L + K- 1. The received sequence will be a noisy version of this path, and the 
decoder's job will be to guess which path the encoder actually took. Since 
there will be a total of 2^ possible paths, if L is large it will not in general be 
possible to compare the received message to each of tliese paths. The 
approach taken to tliis problem by sequential decoding algorithms is to

explore a very small subset of the possible paths. The idea of sequential 
decoding is to pragrain the decoder to act much as a driver who occasionally 
makes a wrong choice at a fork in tJie road, but quickly discovers liis error, 
poes back, and tries tite other. 

Sequential decoding is a procedure for systematically searciiing through a 
code tree and using received information as a guide, with the objective of 
eventually tracing out llic path representing the actually transmitted informa- 
tion sequence. The two best-known sequential decoding algorithms are the 
stack algorithm [5-5') and 5-60] and the Fano algorithm [5-61]. 

Most sequential decoder implementations to date iiave used some modifica- 
tion of the Fano algorithm. Briefly, the Fano algorithm operates as follows. 
Starting at the INITIAL node in the code tree, a path is traced tlirough the 
tree by moving ahead one node at a lime. At each node encountered, the 
decoder evaluates a branch metric for each branch stemming from that node. 
The branch metric is a function of tlie transition probabilities between the 
received symbols and the transmitted symbols along the hypotiiesized branch. 
The decoder will initially choose the brancli with tlie largest metric value 
(corresponding to tlie closest fit to the received symbols). The metric is then 
added to a patli metric, wiiich is tlie running sum of branch metrics along tlie 
path presently being followed. This path metric is called the Fano metric 
[5-30] and is given by

\(k) - (x, , ■ • • , x^.) is a /: branch path stenimhig from the initial node of the

received sequence y. The /jO'i/l-'^-'i/) 'TC the ciiannel transition probabilities. The 
piy'jj) are the probability distributions on the channel output alphabet, and r 
is tlie code rate. The .Vy,'s and >',y's arc tJie channel input and output symbols, 
respectively, corresponding to the /th branch. 

Along with the path metric, the decoder keeps track of the running thresh- 
old T, As long as tlie path metric keeps increasing, the decoder assumes it is 
on the right track and keeps moving forward, raising T to lie within a fixed 
constant A, below tlie path metric. If, on die otlier hand, the patli metric 



335 



OF PCOli C;y;.".l'«V 

decreases at a particular node, such tliat it becomes less than T, the decoder 
assumes it may have made a mistake and backs up. It will then systematically 
search nodes at which the path metric is greater than T until it finds a path 
that starts increasing again, or until it exhausts all nodes lying above T, At 
this point it is forced to lower T, by A, and search again. Eventually the 
decoder will find a path that appears to have an increasing path metric, and 
will penetrate sufficiently deeply into the tree that there is a high probability 
the first few branches followed will be correct. These branches wilt not be 
returned to by the decoder in a backward search. At this point, the informa- 
tion bits corresponding to these branches can be considered decoded, and the 
decoder niijy erase received data pertaining to tliese branches. 



In summary, at every stage the decoder is located at some node in the tree. 
From this node the decoder looks forward (I.e., deeper) into the tree. If it 
sees a node it likes, it moves forward to that node. If not, it moves backward 
and then tries to move forward along another branch. It decides whetlier or 
not it lik:s a given node by comparing the metric of that node to a running 
threshold T. The decoder stops as soon as it reaches a terminal node (say, one 
at depth L + hi) and outputs tlie information sequence corresponding to the 
branch ending at that node. If the channel is quiet, tlie decoder can trace the 
correct path through the termination node. However, wlien the channel gels 
noisy, it may happen that the decoder is fooled nna traces an incorrect path. 
In this case we have undetected errors made by the decoder. Correct and 
incorrect paths and nodes of divergence of two paths are shown in Fig. B-I. 
For example, if OIIO-'- is the transmitted sequence and OlOO--- is the 
decoded sequence (see Fig. B-1) then we have an undetected error at 
position 3. 

The decoder consists of a buffer to hold quantized received samples, a 
copy of the encoder, and equipment to measure the merit of the encoder's 
output relative to the received symbol sequence. For any given sequence of 
information digits u, the decoder can run u through the repUca encoder, find 
the associated x, and calculate r(.\, y), which is the value of the node asso- 
ciated, with u. Now we reexamine the tliree kinds of moves from one node (o 
another: forward, sideways, and backward. On a forward move, the decoder 
goes one branch to the right in the received value tree from the previously 
hypothesized node. Instrumentally, this corresponds to shifting the replica 
encoder shift register to the right and inserting "i" new hypothesized infor- 
mation bits at the left. The new value for tlie metric can bo found as 



r^^, = T{x{k + 1), y{k + D) = r(x(fc), y(fc)) + X^ti(x^^,. y^^^,) 



(B-3) 



336 



OF PGC.7 G^"-'-'"'^ 
The digits involved in this calculation are simply the n channel input digits 
coming out of tJic replica encoder. A sideways move is a move from one node 
to another node differing only in tlie last branch of the tree. Instrumentally, 
tliis corresponds to changing tlic "b" left-most bits in the replica encoder shift 
register. Again, the cliange in value from one node to the other is determined 
by the change in tiie last n channel input digits, A backward move is a move 
one branch to tiie left in the received value tree. Instrumentally, this corre- 
sponds to shifting the encoder sliift register to the left and reinserting the last 
"Zj" bits to pass out of the shift register on the right. The new value is 
calculated from the old value by subtracting off the last term in the summa- 
tion over /. Thus, for each possible move, the change in value from the old 
node to the new is a function only of the last // hypothesized channel inputs. 
The typical behavior of Y^ for the correct path and incorrect paths is shown 
in Fig, B-2. This behavior of F^ will be used to indicate whether the decoder 
is tracing the correct path or an incorrect patli. As the decoder traces a path 
x.{k) through the code tree one branch at a time, it computes the Fano metric 
r^ of x(k). When 1"^ increases as k Increases, x(A) is presumably the correct 
path. However, when T^ starts to decrease with increasing k, the decoder is 
presumably tracing an incorrect path. The node of divergence is where an 
incorrect path branches off from the correct path.

The Fano decoding algorithm is then a set of rules by which the decoder is 
able both lo recognize wliether it is tracing the correct path or an incorrect 
path and to initiate a systematic search for the node of divergence when the 
decoder senses the possibility that it is tracing an incorrect path. For each 
node of the code tree at level k we assign a metric value that is equal to the 
Fano metric l\ of the path leading to the node. Obviously, the metric value 
Tq «f the initial node is zero. 

The essential features of the Fano decoding algoritlim [5-2, 5-12, and 5-62] 
are described below; 

(1) The decoder begins searcliing for the correct path from the initial node 
of the code tree. It moves one branch at a time. 

(2) The decoder must first order t!io 2'' branches (for rate 1/h convolu- 
tional codes we have 2 branches) stemming from node at depth k in 
accordance with their branch metrics \ corresponding to the fcth 
block of the received setiuence, The branch with largest metric is first, 
the branch with the next largest metric is second and so on. Note that 
for large b or for a saving in computation we may choose not to order 
llie branch metrics. In this case tiie Fano algorithm will be slightly 
changed from its original version. 

(3) Suppose that the decoder has traced a path x(A:) up to a node A'^, at 
deptli A;, as shown in Fig, B-3. From node A'j, the decoder either 
moves along a branch forward to a node N^ at depth {ft + 1 ) or steps 
back to ihe node A'3 at deptii {k~ 1). which was accepted previously. 

{4; As the decoder moves from one node to another, it maintains a run- 
ning threshold T = /A, where / is an integer and A is the threshold 
spacing, which is a design parameter. The running tlireslvold at the 
initial node is set to zero. 

(5) Suppose that the decoder is at nod, N^ at depth k and that the 
current running threshold is 7^. First, the decoder attempts to make a 
forward movement. It looks forward (computes the next node metric 
and compares it with the threshold) and considers the node N^ at 
depth (ft+1), which is connected to node A^j by the first branch 
stemming from node A^j . The metric value of node N-^ , denoted 
I\+](Af2), is computed and compared wilh the current running thresii- 
old T^. If r^+i(A'2)^ Tf^, the decoder moves forward (increasing k) 
and accepts node N^- "^ ^'^'^ '^^ "^^ ^^^^^ "r"^ ^'1^' '''"^ decoder has ever

tightened. In the same manner, the decoder attempts lo move forward

Thus, the running threshold at node V, becomes T,^ - A. We say Uial 
lire running threshold is loosened. Witii this reduced running liueshold, 
the decoder looks forward to node A^j again. 

The running threshold is tightened when and only when the decoder 
moves forward to a node that has never been examined before. The 



339 



running threslioJd is never tiglitened during backward motion. The run- 
ning tliresUold is reduced wiicn and only when tlie decoder is trapped

ing tlio tliroshold after accepting A'^, we have to clieck that tJie ,.ietric 
of tlie previous node satisfies \\iNi) < TJ. + A. Tliis corresponds to 
checking that we are visiting the current node N^ for the first time. 

The purpose of tlie restriction [\{A',)< 7). + A is to prevent tlie 
threshold from being raised again on one of these nodes that iias been 
previously hypothesized. In fact, if this restriction were not imposed, 
tlie decoder would quickly find itself in a loop, iiypotiiesizing the same 
node again with tlie same threshold. 

The detailed movement of the decoder is illustrated by the fiow chart 
shown in Fig, B-4.

Chapter 6 
Command System 

Nathan A, Burow and Man K. Tarn 



6.1 Introduction 

The Command System (CMD) provides the means by whjcli a project controls 
tlie activities of its spacecraft from tlie eartli. Tills chapter presents an overview 
rS the Multimission Command (MMC) System. The major components within 
the MMC System are discussed, with the emphasis on the telecommunication- 
related implementations. Two versions of the spacecraft command detection 
system - the Viking heritage command detector and the NASA standard com- 
mand detector - are discussed in detail. Tlie former prevails in the existing fliglit 
projects and the latter will likely be adopted by the missions of the near future. 
The preparation of Design Control Tables for the control of command link 
performance between Deep Space Stations (DSSs) and the spacecraft is also 
discussed. 



6.2 Multimission Command System 

The Multimission Command System [6-1] extends from the point at which 
validated commands are entered at the Mission Operations Center (MOC) to the 
point on the spacecraft where commands, after error detection and correction, 
are distributed to spacecraft subsystems. Thus, tlie MMC System includes the 

h

OP pOOe^Q«J'^-"'' 

command functions performed by tlie MOC, the Deep Space Network (DSN), 
and spacecraft command detector and command decoder. The MMC System 
does not include the project-dependent Mission Sequence System, where com- 
mands are formulated and validated, nor does it include the spacecraft subsys- 
tems wliich intepret and respond to the commands. The Command System, thus 
delimited, performs a multi-mission command delivery and accounting function. 
A block diagram showing the boundaries of the MMC System is given in Fig. 6-1, 

The MCC System employs a "store-and-forward" method for delivery of 
command sequences to a spacecraft. The ability to store commands at various 
points in the command delivery system eliminates time criticality from the 
transport of commands. Large files of spacecraft commands may be generated 
by a project, sent by the MOC to the DBS, and correct receipt verified before a 
command is to be "forwarded" to the spacecraft. This allows a project to pre- 
pare large files of spacecraft commands in advance and then to forward several 
files to the DSS at the beginning of a spacecraft tracl?. The same store-and- 
forward concept is employed between the DSS and the spacecraft. Commands 
may be radiated from the DSS to the spacecraft, correct receipt verified, and the 
commands stored onboard the spacecraft for later execution. It should be noted 
tliat this store-and-forward mode of operation does not preclude near-real-time 
commanding of the spacecraft. The MCC store-and-forward operations are 
represented functionally in Fig. 6-2. 

For discussion purposes, the Command Systems may be divided into a 
ground segment and a spacecraft segment. The functional operations for these 
two portions are briefly described below. 



6.2.1 Ground Portion of Command System Operations 

On the ground side of the Command System, command sequences generated 
by the projects for the different spacecraft are stored at the MOC. Commands 
for a particular spacecraft are selected from the command files, formatted into

messages, and stored for transmittal, via the Ground Communication Facility 
(GCF), to a specified DSS, The command messages contain the commands to be 
radiated to the spacecraft, timing instructions to the DSS for the radiation of 
the commands, and error detection/correction coding. The DSS verifies correct 
receipt of the command files or requests retransmission of files containing 
errors. The spacecraft commands are extracted from the messages by the DSS 
Command Processor Assembly (CPA) and stored in the CPA until the time 
specified for their radiation to the spacecraft. When a command is to be radiated 
from the DSS to the spacecraft it is placed in a queue in the CPA and sent to the 
DSS Command Modulator Assembly (CMA). The CMA modulates the command 
bits onto a subcarrier which then modulates the DSS transmitter for radiation 
of tlie command to the spacecraft. 



G.2.2 Spacecraft Portion of Command System Operations 

The spacecraft portion of the Command System consists of two subassem- 
blies: tlie command detector and the command decoder. Upon receipt of the 
composite command signal from the spacecraft receiver, the command detector 
removes the modulated subcarrier, detects the binary command bit stream, and 
presents tlie bit stream to tlie command decoder. The decoder then determines 
tlie validity of its input and, if it is a valid command, decodes it and passes the 
decoded command to tiie addressed spacecraft subsystem. The decoder, tliere- 
fore, depends only on command format and tends to be oriented toward a 
specific mission. The detector, on the other hand, is dependent on the uplink 
modulation scheme and tends to be less mission -dependent. 



6.3 DSN Command System Capabilities 

The capabilities of the DSN Command System that affect spacecraft designs 
are described in this section. More detailed information is contained in [fi-2] 
tlirough [64] . The DSN Command System provides the capability for com- 
manding one spacecraft from each Deep Space Station, The functions performed 
by the DSN Command System include the following: 

(1) Establishing the DSN configuration for tlie specified spacecraft. 

(2) Receiving tlie command data from the MOC and storing it at tJie DSS. 

(3) Queuing command data to be radiated to the spacecraft. 

(4) Radiating tlie command data to the spacecraft. 

(5) Monitoring and reporting DSN Command System status and events. 

A detailed diagram of the DSN Command System (Mark III-80) is presented 
in Fig. 6-3.

OF POOli QUALiVV 

The DSN Command System at each DSS consists of a Command Processor 
Assembly (CPA) for software functions, a Command Modulator Assembly 
(CMA) for generating the command waveform, and the exciters, transmitters 
and antennas for RF carrier modulation and transmission. Note the redundancy 
of these units at each DSS in Fig. 6-3. The DSN Command System produces a 
pulse code modulation (PCM) non-return-to-zero (NRZ-L) data waveform. This 
waveform is then used to bl-phase modulate a subcarrier in the phase-sliift- 
keyed (PSK) mode, or to switch between two subcarriers in the frequency-shift- 
keyed (FSK) mode. Data rates are variable from 1 to 128 bits per second. An 
upgrade to 2000 bp5 is planned [6-5] . PSK data rates can be either noncoherent 
or coherent with the subcarrier frequency. PSK and FSK subcarrier frequencies 
may be selected in the range of 100 Uz to 16 kHz, with a resolution of 0.1 Hz. 
PSK subcarriers may be either sinewave or squarewave. For FSK modulation, 
only sinewave subcarriers are available. The RF carrier may be modulated at 
modulation index angles from O.I to 1.5 radians peak, for both sinewave and 
squarewave subcarriers. Complete performance specification for the CMA is 
presented in [6-6] . 

Command carrier power suppression and data power suppression as functions 
of modulation index angle are:

stations (DSS 14, 43, and 63), an additional transmitter is available for emer- 
gency operation having a nominal carrier output power of 100 kW. A more 
complete definition of existing and planned DSN command capabilities is 
containea in [64] and [6-5] , respectively. 



6.4 Spacecraft Command System Capabilities and 
Performance 

Tlie capabilities iind performance of the spacecraft command system are, in 
general, characterized by the choice of the command detector configuration and 
tiie link design. The following specifications are important factors for the hard- 
ware design of the command detector: 

(1) Maximum bit rate. 

(2) Minimum preamble to acquire synchronization. 

(3) Requirement for external data ambiguity resolution. 

(4) Modulation characteristics. 

(5) Subcarrier characteristics. 

(6) Data transition dependency. 

The performance of the coii.mand link is specified by the following param- 
eters: 

(1) Required per bit energy-to-noise spectral density ratio (STgfN^) to 
achieve a given bit error rate (BER). 



349 



ORIGINAL PA'v .-. ^G 
OF POOR QUiirJi'V 

(2) Required duration (bit-times) to achieve bit synclironi/ation, with an 
associated false acquisition probability at a given ST^fN^. 

(3) Error statistics for in-Iocii and out-of-lock indications, 

Past spacecraft missions liave employed the foIlowitiB types of command 
detectors: a single-channel analog command detector, a two-channel PSK com- 
inand detector and a single-channel digital command detector (\'iking Heritage). 
A new single-channel digital command detector (NASA standard) has been 
developed and will probably be used on new missions of the near future. Table 
6-1 shows tlie general capabilities and performance of these four command 
detectors and indicates their usage in terms of past and expected future space 
missions. At present, only the two digital command detectors are in use. The 
operation of these two command detectors is described in detail below. 

6.4.1 Viking Heritage Command Detector Operation 

The Viking Heritage command detector was originally developed for the 
Viking Mission, and was later adopted by the Voyager and Galileo Projects. It 
accepts a 512-Hz squarewave subcarrier modulated by data bits from tiie RF 
receiver output. The bit rate is defined by selecting the number of subcarrier 
cycles per bit (denoted by M), where M is constrained to be an even integer. 
Command data bit rates in the range of 1 bps through 256 bps may be selected 
(hardwired prior to launch) based on use of the 512 Hz squarewave subcarrier 
and a requirement to have at least two subcarrier cycles per bit. 

The Viking Heritage command detector first establishes two levels of syn- 
chronization, i.e., subcarrier sync and bit sync, before data bits are detected. 
To accomplish this synchronization, transmitted commands are prefixed by a 
length of unmodulated subcarrier, and then by a length of subcarrier modu- 
lated by bit sync only. The Viking Heritage command detector first establishes 
subcarrier sync by comparing the unmodulated subcarrier with a reference 
signal, Then a replica of the bit-sync modulated subcarrier is used as a reference 
to establish bit sync. After establishing these references the system can detect 
datn. All of the functions of synchronization and data detection are performed 
by the process of cross-correlation. One unique design feature of this system 
is tlie use of a method of discrete-step phase tracking which compensates for 
small frequency offsets due to Doppler shifts and/or oscillator instabilities. 
This method of piiase tracking is performed by Pccumulating, for an interval 
of one data bit period, a sum of samples taken near the transitions of the signal. 
The polarity of the sum determines the direction of the adjustment made to the 
demodulation reference. The detailed performance analysis for the subcarrier 
tracking system is presented in [6-7] . 

The block diagram for the Viking Heritage command detector is presented 
in Fig. 64. The system requires a lock detector to ensure the presence of the

proper signal. TJie iu-lock condition is determined by comparing tlie sum of tiie 
absolute values of five conseeutive bits against a preset threshold value. 

6.4.1.1 Detection algorithm. The Viking Heritage command deteetor is basic- 
ally a correlation device. During subcarrler acquisition the correlator estimates 
the peak point on the correlation curve by cross-correlating 'he input signal 
with internally generated, phase-shifted estimates of tiie subcarrier. The estimate 
whose phase most closely agieos with that of the input signal is chosen as the 
subcarrier demodulation reference. The command input waveform is sampled 
16 timcj per subcarrier cycle and correlated with 16 reference waveforms which 
are offset with respect to each otlier by increments of one sample period. Thus 
the digital correlation curve seen by the system is the staircase function shown 
in Fig. 6-5b, wliich approximates from the continuous correlation curve of 
Fig. 6-5a. 

Subcarrier and bit sync acquisitions arc performed in sequence according to 
the basic system algorithm shown in Fig. 6-6. In its initial state, the system 
simultaneously correlates 16 piiase-shifted replicas of the subcarrier with the 
incoming signal for 5 bit periods. A correlation period of 5 bit times is required 
to make eacii of tiie threshold tests reliable. At the end of the 5 bit times, if the 
largest correlation value exceeds a preset threshold value, the system advances 
to mode 2. Otiiewise, ilie system stays in mode 1 and repeats the subcarrier 
correlations. 

In mode 2 tiie correlation against tiie subcarrier reference is repeated, and 
threshold is again checked. If the check is confirmed the system enters mode 3, 
where the replica having the largest correlation value is chosen as the subcarrier 
estimate and the subcarrier clock is "jammed" to correspond to this phase. The 
system then leaves mode 3 and automatically enters mode 4, which is a wait 
period of 50 bits. During mode 4 the system tracks subcarrier phase offsets 
between the transmitted signal and its internally generated replica caused by 
Doppier sliifts and/or oscillator instabilities. The 50 bits are needed to accom- 
plish tliis tracking with a small steady-state average phase error. Entry into 
mode 5 is automatic after completion of the 50 bits. 

In mode 5 the system attempts to determine if bit sync is present. During 
this mode the system continues tlie subcarrier threshold tests. As long as thresh- 
old tests are successful, the system assumes that bit sync is not present on the 
incoming signal and continues tracking the subcarrier. If a test fails, the system 
assumes bit sync is on and enters mode 6. 

In mode 6 the system attempts to establish bit synchronization between tlie 
local bit sync estimates and the received command signal. During this mode the 
incoming signal is correlated for 5 bit periods against the 16 phase-shifted 
sequences of the bit sync squarewave, which is synchronous in a preset way with

the data bits. If threshold is not exceeded, the system goes to mode 10; other- 
wise it goes to mode 7, where the bit sync clock is jainmed to its proper phase 
in tlie same manner as for subearrier phase selection. The system then enters 
mode 8, where it waits for the start of the next data bit and then proceeds to 
mode 9. In mode 9 the system tracks botli subcarrier and bit sync phase offsets 
for 10 bits. After 10 bit times all synchroni2ation is complete and the system 
begins to detect data bits. During mode 9 the system tracks both subcarrier and

bit sync pliase offsets. Tracking is accomplished by forming a sum of samples 
talten near tl:e known transitions of signal. Tiie sut, is compared to zero at the 
end of I bit of accumul'ition time, and the sign of the sum determines tlie 
direction of the clock bump. Tlie clock is bumped a fixed discrete amount in 
either direction (advance or retard). 

Detection of data is accomplislied simply by performing the correlation 
operations described earlier. With all phases now determined, however, only the 
in-phase correlation is of concern. This in-phase correlation is an approximation 
to the output of a matched filter, which is known to be tlie optimum detector. 

In mode 9 the system also monitors the presence of command signal by the 
process of lock detection. The lock detector acquires the sum of the magnitudes 
of 5 data bit correlations and compares this sum to a threshold. If threshold is 
not exceeded, the system declares "out-of-lock" and goes to mode 10, In mode 
10 a subcarrier threslioid test is performed. If threshold is exceeded, the system 
enters mode 5; if not, tlie system returns to mode 1. 

6.4.1.2 Command prefix. The acquisition procedures described in Section 
6.4.1.1 cannot succeed unless the proper signal component is present during 
each of the correlation modes. Specifically, during modes I and 2 unmodulated 
subcarrier must be present, and during mode 6 subcarrier modulated by tlie bit 
sync must be present. To meet these requirements, the prefix shown in Fig. 6-7 
is sent before each series of commands. 

In designing this prefix signal, all the worst possible conditions are considered 
to assure that incorrect interpretation of the signal is minimized. When the sys- 
tem is initially in mode 1 , it has no sync information and may begin to correlate 
at an arbitrary time with respect to the transmitted prefix. Consequently, there 
may exist a mode 1 correlation for which tlie prefix is only present for part of 
tlie correlation time. If this first correlation does not exceed threshold, mode 1 
must be repeated and a situation such as tliat shown in Fig, 6-8a will exist. To 
allow for successful compli.,jon of mode I and mode 2 in this case, 10 more 
command bit times (\OXM subcarrier cycles) of unmodulated subcarrier will 
be required after the unsuccessful mode 1 correlation is completed. Therefore, 
IS command bit times of the prefix are allowed for unmodulated subcarrier, 

A different situation occirs if the mode 1 correlation is successful, even 
througti the prefix is only partially present. This condition is shown in Fig. 6-8b. 
(Note tliat the "jam" modes consume a negligible amount of time and therefore 
are not shown.) In such a case, mode 1 and mode 2 have more than ample time 
for completion, but the timing of the mode 5 bit sync correlation becomes 
critical. If the mode 1 correlation were completed very early in the prefix, it 
might be possible for the system to enter mode 5 before the bit sync portion of 
tlie prefix arrived. This situation is prevented by the mode 4 waiting period. As

a very conservativi; worst-case design, it may be assumed that the mode 1 corre- 
lation is completed at tlio very beginning of the prefix. In this case the required 
waiting period would have to be 50 bits, which is the time allotted for mode 4. 
Figure 6-Sb also points up the reason for the existence of mode 2; if the mode 1 
correlation is successful witli only partial correlation with the prefix, the result- 
ant correlation values are likely to be very bad estimates of the subcarrier 
phase. The existence of mode 2 guarantees tliat prefix will be present over the 
entire subcarrier phase-determining correlation. 

Bit sync acquisition occurs in modes 6 tlirougli 8. From Fig. 6-8b, we see that 
if worst-case condhions prevail, the mode 4 waiting .-eriod will consume 50 
command bit times of unmodulated subcarrier. In this case 20 command bit 
times of bit-sync-modulated subcarrier would be needed to successfully com- 
plete modes 5 and 6. To allow for this eventuality, 20 command bit times of

the prefix are allotted to bit sync modulated subcarrier. Thus, with the prefix 
signal shown in Fig. 6-7, the system should be able to successfully acquire sub- 
carrier sync and bit sync. However, it should be noted that modes 5 and 6 
(including the small amount of time for mode 7) may be completed at any point 
during an actual transmitted data bit period, since the initial phase offset is 
random. Even though sync has been established, it will be necessary for the 
system to wait until the start of tlie next bit before it begins to detect data. 
This is the purpose of mode 8, as shown in Fig. 6-8c. After mode 8 the system 
tracks the pliase offsets of subcarrier and bit sync for 10 command bit times. 
This 10 bits of tracking ensures that all synchronization is complete and that 
the system is ready to output data. 

6.4.1,3 Command detector power allocation. The Viking Heritage command 
detector must detect and acquire both subcarrier and bit sync references in 
sequence befoie detecting data. To accomplish tiiis synchronization in sequence, 
commands transmitted from the Deep Space Stations arc prefixed by a short 
burst of unmodulated subcarrier and of the subcarrier bi-phase modulated by the 
bit sync. During the data detection mode the command information bits are 
bi-phase modulated by the subcarrier and the bit sync. The signal transmitted 
by the DSS for each mode described above can be written as

carrier and bit sync acquisition are performed in sequence according to the basic

demodulation process of the Viking Heritage Command Detector can be 
modeled as a second-ordei all-digital phase-locked loop as shown in Fig. 6-9. The 
low-pass filtering loss can be estimated by assuming a squarewave input to a flat, 
sharp cutoff, low-pass filter model. In this design, the low-pass filter bandwidth

6.4.2 NASA Standard Command Detector Operation 

The NASA standard command detector was developed as an integral part of 
the NASA standard transponders. It was designed to be in compliance with tlie 
NASA Planetary Program Flight/Ground Data System Standards [6-9] . Tlie unit 
is operable in two modes-the NRZ mode without a subcarrier for TDRS appli- 
cation and the PSK mode with a 16-kHz sinewave subcarrier for near-earth and 
deep-space applications. This chapter is concerned with the PSK mode only. A 
total of nine command data bit rates are in-flight selectable. The allowed bit 
rates are specified as 2000/2^, where A^ = 0, 1, 2, ... 8. 

Unlike the Viking Heritage system, the NASA standard command detector 
establishes subcarrier and bit synchronizations simultaneously, thus eliminating 
tiie cumbersome multimode acquisition process required by the former. For 
the NASA standard command detector, detections of subcarrier, bit sync and 
data are performed simultaneously with a single correlation process. The sub- 
carrier and bit sync phases are coherently related and are controlled by a quad- 
rature subcarrier tracking loop and a data-transition bit synchronization loop, 
respectively. 

A block diagram for the NASA standard command detector is shown in 
Fig. 6-10, Functionally, tltis command detector consists of a coherent auto- 
matic gain control (AGC) unit, a sample-and-hold (SH) circuit, an analog-to- 
dii^ital converter (ADC), a second-order data-aided subcarrier tracking loop, a 
data transition bit synchronization loop, and a lock detector. Structurally, it 
consists of the signal conditioning assemblies, i.e., AGC, SH, and ADC, read 
only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), and a digital processing 
assembly employing a custom-LSI approacli. Figure 6-II illustrates tlie func- 
tional architecture of this command detector. 

6.4.2.1 Subcarrier traclting. The NASA standard command detector utilizes a 
coherent sampling scheme to implement a second-order suppressed subcarrier 
data-aided loop. The theory and analysis of the data-aided loop configuration 
have been documented [6-10]. The subcanier tracking loop utilizes a perfect 
integrator and a quasicontinuously variable phase correction (resolution 1/64 of 
one subcarrier cycle). The maximum subcarrier phase correction step is 45 de- 
grees. The entire tracking algorithm is stored in ROM, with ROM-residenl loop 
coefficient; selected during tlie acquisition and the tracking phases so as to 
meet tiie acquisition time requirements and minimize steady-state phase jitter. 

6.4.2.1.1 Coherent sampling. The sampling process of the NASA standard com- 
mand detector takes place at llie subcarrier level as illustiated in Fig. 6-12. Two

samples QO deg apart arc taken in each subcarrier cycle. This process effectively 
removes the subcarrier and translates the input sequences to baseband. By sam- 
pling in quadrature, one channel represents the in-phase or data channel and the 
other the quadrature phase or error channel. The integrated sampling results of 
the error eliannel are used to maintain subcarrier synchronization, and those of 
the data channel are used to maintain bit synchronization and detect tiie data 
bits, Subcarrier phase corrections are executed at the end of each detected bit. 
The amounts of correction or bump sizes for various conditions are predeter- 
mined and are stored in ROM. 

With tilts demodulation scheme, the subcarrier reference has two possible 
stable lock points. As a result, the polarity of the detected bits may be in phase 
or 180 deg out of phase. This ambiguity of dnta polarity must be resolved in the 
decoding process. This function is usually performed outside of the command 
detector domain (see section 6.4.3.1 below). 

6.4.2.1,2 Tracking loop model The command detector subcarrier tracking loop 
may be modeled as shown in Fig. 6-13. Sampled values of the error channel are 
used to estimate the instantaneous, phase error of the subcarrier zero-crossing. 
It is readily seen that if the zero-crossing phase error is 0, the sampled value at 
that instant is A,, sin <^, where A^ is the voltage amplitude of the input sinusoid. 
These samples are converted into eight-bit digital numbers which are accumu- 
lated over one bit period. A total of A' samples are taken for each accumulation, 
where A' is the ratio of the bit and subcarrier periods. At the end of the accumu- 
lation, the integrated value is scaled according to the bit rate and dumped into 
the loop filter. The scaling is used to maintain a constant subcarrier loop dynamic 
range at all permissible data rates. The subcarrier loop filter is a first-order digital 
filter. The output of this filter is the summation of two branches. One branch is 
simply the scaled input value and the other is a scaled running accumulation of 
tlie input. The loop filter output, together with the data estimator from tlie bit

sync loop, provides a quantitative value to the digitally controlled oscillator to 
either advance or retard its phase so as to reduce the zero-crossing phase error of 
die subcarrler. An analysis of this tracking loop has been documented [6-11]. 

6.4,2.2 Bit sync tracking. For bit sync tracking and data detection, the sampled 
values of the data channel arc accumulated over a bit interval. A measure of the 
normalized bit sync phase error is obtained by Integrating over a bit period cen- 
tered at the expected data transition point. This process is called the mid-phase 
accumulation, as distinguished from the in-phase accumulation normally per- 
formed for data detection. 

6.4.2.2.1 Bit sync algorithm. Proper detection of tlie demodulated data stream 
requires the use of a matched filter. Implementation of this matched filter, in 
turn, requires the generation of accurate end-of-bit estimates. 

The bit sync configuration of the NASA standard command detector utilizes 
a digital data transition tracking loop which consists of two parallel branches. 
The in-phase branch, from which the data estimates are produced, monitors tlie 
polarity of any data transition, while the mid-phase branch obtains a measure of 
the lack of bit synchronization. 

The theories of the digital data transition tracking loop have been extensively 
analyzed [6-12, 13, 14]. The implementation of the NASA standard command 
detector bit sync loop was largely based on the results of these analyses, 

6.4.2.2.2 Bit sync loop model. Figure 6-14 illustrates a model for the bit sync 
loop. The data samples are taken from the data channel which is in quadrature 
to the subcarrler tracking error channel. If the subcarrler zero-crossing phase 
error is </>, then the instantaneous input value of the data sample is A^ cos <p. 
These samples are taken once per subcarrler cycle and are converted into digital 
numbers in the same manner as the subcarrler tracking process and are accumu- 
lated into two separate accumulators-one in-phase and one mid-phase. At the

end of each in-pluisc bit purkul, tlic sign of the In-phase aocuniuUttor represents 
tlie bit estimate, if tliere is a data transition between two adjacent bits of data, 
tlie contents of tlie mid-pinise accunnilalor will be retained and fiirOicr inte- 
grated into a tiiird accumulator. Here, A* transitions are required to determine 
the relative pliase error of tlie bit sync estimate, where K is a constant of the bit 
sync loop residing in the ROM, and an advance or retart correction is made pro- 
portionately. {K equals 4 is currently boinp used.) Correction can be made to 
the nearest subcarrler cycle. This resolution is augmented by the subcarrier 
tracking loop performance to provide adequate overall bit sync resolution. 

6.4.2.3 Anfonintic gain control. Automatic gain control establishes a constant, 
predetermincil input signal amplitude to the command detector over a wide 
dynamic range of received carrier signal power. Tlie NASA standard oonunand 
detector employs a coherent AGC system which, designed witli a lop-linear 
diaractcristic, provides a dynamic range in excess of 40 dU with loop perfor- 
mance independent of signal amplitude and scaled with data rale, A block dia- 
gram for the AGC loop model is shown in Fig. Cvl.'i. 

The centra! element of the AGC system is the gain controllable amplifier 
wlitch precedes the signal sampler. The data lor AGC processing are taken from 
the output of tlie in-phase accumulator as described in the bit .sync tracking 
loop. The magnitude of M consecutive values from the in-phase accumulator is 
integrated in a second accumulator and the result, after appropriate scaling, is 
compared against a predetermined reference value. The value M is a loop con- 
stant programmable in the resident ROM (M equals 9 is currently being used.) 
The ditTercnce between tlie actual ami the reference magnitude is continuously 
integrated in another digital integrator, the output of whicli operates on an AGC 
function circuit which produces the desired gain sotting of tlie AGC amplifier. 

6.4.2.4 Lock detector. Tlie lock detector of the NASA standard command 
detector determines whether or not a command signal is present and provides 
this decision to the command decoder. In the NASA standard command de- 
tector, the lock detection algorithm and threshold coefficients arc ROMresident, 
providing complete fiexitiility in tailoring the detector to meet mission-specific 
acquisition and deacquisition performance requirements. 

(>,4.2.4,! Lock dowctor spt'ciftcations. The genera! performance requirements 
for tlic NASA standard eonunund detector m-lock indication for all data rates 
arc given in Table 6-2. 

6.4.2.4.2 Lock detector model. The lock detection algorithm is closely related 
to the AGC algorithm discussed in the preceding section. The model used in 
describing the lock detector operation and in determining its lock thresholds is 
sliown in Fig, 6-16. As can be seen from this model, tlie same information used

also iisetl for tilt! iii-lock coiidltitjn evaluation. To detcrininc the presence or 
absence of command sipnal. tiio miiptiUiiilc of tlie matched niter for each bit 
time is taken and is integrated over M bit times. Then, after appropriate scaling, 
the integrated value is compared witli n lock tlircshold ("LKTII") if the detector 
has been out of lock, or with an unlock thresliold ("ULKTU") if it has been 
in-lock. Tlte possible oiitcoines of tliese tests are sunmiarized in Table 6-3. 
Notice that a single test result is not sufficient to change tlie lock indication. 

A change in lock indication, whether I'rom out of lock to in lock or vice 
versa, requires at least two consecutive threshold tests indicating the same 
result. The choice of the mmiber of consecutive tests to effect a lock indication 
cliange dictates tlie probabilities for various parameters regarding acquisition and 
dropping lock, and determines the response time of the lock detector loop. 

When the conunand detector is out of lock, the AGC amplifier is driven to its 
maximum gain setting and hold fixed. Only after lock has been achieved is the 
ACiC permitted to seek its quiescent point of operation. 

6.'t.2.S CommoHd prefix. The NASA standard conunand detector does not 
require a fixed transmission procedure to acquire lock. However, to insure that 
no valid data bits are lost before in-lock indication is declared, n sequence of 
alternate* i's and O's is transmitted prior to the data bit stream to assist rapid 
bit sync acquisition. To meet the lock statistics specified in Table 6-2, a 132-bit 
preamble is required. 

6.4.2.6 Power allocation. Since the NASA standard command detector assumes 
a sinewave subcarrier, the ratios of data power and carrier power to the total 
received power as a function of the modulation index are

6.4.2.7 Clwniiel performance. As mentioned previously, the design concepts are 
based on [licoretical results of related works [6-8] , [6-10] , [6-11], [6-13] , and 
[6-14] . No rigorous analyses were attempted to identify the degradation due to 
the various individual command detector components. However, the aggregate 
detector degradation was obtained through simulation and tests. Table 6-4 sliows 
the observable performance and degradation of tlie NASA command detector 
under various bit rales and frequency offset conditions. 

6.4.3 Command Decoding 

The functions of the spacecraft command detector are limited to demodula- 
tion and detection of the composite command signal. The contents of the com- 
mand sequence are transparent to the command detector. In order to process 
the command sequence and deliver the individual commands to the users, the 
detected command bit stream must be decoded and distributed. Tiiese functions 
are the responsibility of the spacecraft command decoder. 

The proper decoding of the command sequence requires a complete under- 
standing of the command structure, word format, and contents. These elements 
are mission dependent, Tliougli the command decoding process is an important 
discipline of spacecraft system design, it is beyond the scope and purposes of 
this chapter. The only detector-related decoding problem is the data ambiguity 
inherent in tlie NASA Standard Command Detector. 

6.4.3.1 Real-time decoder ambiguity resolver. Since the NASA standard com- 
mand detector may deliver citlier normal or inverted data bits, depending upon

the axis at wiiicli the subcarricr is locked, care must be exercised to assure that 
the right coiiir"iiids are executed. For an elaborate command decoding system 
utilizing a sopi.isticated computer, the data ambiguity may be stinultaneously 
resolved when the command frame sync is detected. However, with n decoder of 
less sophistication, a real-time ambiguity resolver may be implemented. 

To resolve the data ambiguity on a real-time basis, a sync word must precede 
the command bit stream following the alternate 1 and preamble. Careful selec- 
tion of the sync word will minimize the probability of error at a given length of 
the sync word. When the detector indicates an in-lock condition, the ambiguity 
resolver will first search for this sync word and determine whether it is in its 
normal or inverted position. The subsequent command bits will then bo accepted 
in the polarity as indicated by the sync word polarity decision, A seven-bit 
Barker code has been employed for such a sync word for near-earth applications, 



6.5 Command Channel Design Control 

As a major function of the spacecraft telecommunications system, the com- 
mand channel is subject to the provisions of the telecommunications design 
control policy [6-15]. This section identifies the parameters relating to tlie 
command function and presents an example of the command cliannel design 
control table, 

6.5.1 Carrier Channel 

TJiis section presents the definitions of all the parameters which affect the 
performance of spacecraft receiver carrier tracking. 

6.5.1.1 Total transmitting power at antenna. This parameter is the total power 
into a DSS antenna. The nominal ground transmitted power is 20 kW. However, 
100 kW (and possibly 400 kW) transmitted power may be used for emergency 
and other occasions.

nntctiiia iiicliKliiii; pointing; and circuit toss, and winil and gravity dei'onnalion 
lass. Two antenna nets are nortnally in use: 34- and fi4-m antennas. 

6.5.1.3 Space loss. This is tlie loss due to the transmission niediiim. In n nornuil 
mission, space loss is a function ol" carrier iVequency and spacecraft-earth ranee. 
The absorption loss due to atmospheric and plasma elTecIs represents addi- 
tional losses and should he taken into consideration. 

6.5.1.4 Polurizntioii losK. Tliis is tlie loss due to nilsnialch in polarization be- 
tween the ground and the spacecraft antennas. A measure of cllipliclty is used 
to detennine the polarization loss. 

6.5.1.5 Receiving (spacecraft) nntcnun gain. This parameter represents the gain 
of titc spacecral't antotma in the direction of the incoininf, signal. Traditionally, 
the value of this puraineter is derived by factoring the expected loss duo to 
antenna pointing error into the botesighl antenna gain. 

6.5.1.6 Spacccmft circuit loss. This Is the loss due to transmission cables or 
waveguides from the spacecraft antenna terminal to the receiver input port, 

6.5.1.7 Total received power. This is the rouli/ublc power at tlie receiver input 
port, 

6.5.1.8 System noise spectral density. This is the Gaussian white noise power 
per unit frequency (A^g) Introduced by the environment, cabling, switches, an- 
tenna and receiver. This parameter is proportional to the spacecraft circuit Joss 
and the effective system noise temperature. The latter Is n function of the 
receiver noise figure, circuit loss, cable physical temperature, and antenna noise 
temperature, 

6.5.1.9 Ratio of total receiver power to noise spectral density. This is the ratio 
of total received power to noise spectral density {PjjN^) at the input of the 
receiver. 

6.5.1.10 Ratio of carrier power to total received power. This parameter reflects 
the allocation of power to t!ie carrier as a fraction of tlie total power. It is deter- 
mined by the modulation indices for the connnand and ranging (if present) 
signals. 

6.5.1.11 Currier threshold tracking bandwidth, Wiq. This is the two-sided 
noise bandwidth of the carrier tracking loop at threshold ^^V^o- 

6.5.1.12 Signnl-to-noise ratio hi 2Biq. This is the slgnal-to-noise power ratio 
into the spacecraft carrier tracking phase-locked loop for a bandwidth of 2J3j ^j.

6.5.1.13 Threshold signal>to-noisc ratio in 2Bj^q. This is the minimum value of 
tlie sipnal'to-noise power ratio defined in 6,.'>.12 acceptable for the required 
accuracy of carrier tracking. 

6.5. 1.14 Carrier margin, Tliis is tlie amount of carrier power in excess of the 
minimum awccptable value for proper carrier tracking. 

6.5.2 Command Channel 

Tliis paraprapii presents liie definitions of all tlie parameters relevant to com- 
mand detection. 

6.5.2.1 Bit rate, This parameter refers to the number of command bits trans- 
mitted over a period of one second, 

6.5.2.2 Ratio of command power to totui received power. Tliis power ratio 
rellects tiie allocation of power to the command channel as a fraction of the 
total power. It is deteimined by the modulation index for the conrriand signal. 
Tlie power available to the command detector is readily computable with this 
allocation. 

6.5.2.3 Cummand detector losses. Tiiis is the aggregate loss within the com- 
mand detector, I<'actors contributing to the command detector losses include 
radio loss, waveform distortion, subcarrior demodulation loss, bit sync detec- 
tion loss and circuit loss. 

6.5.2.4 Ratio of command detector per bit energy to noise spectral density. 
This ratio reflects the net energy over one bit period at the output of the com- 
mand detector to the noise spectral density {ST^/N^), 

6.5.2.5 Threshold STq/Nq, This is the minimum acceptable value of tlie ST^f 
N^ defined in 6,5.2.4 to acliicve a given bit error rate. 

6.5.2.6 Performance ninrgin. This is the amount of command power in excess of 
the minimum acceptable value required to acliieve the specified bit error rate. 

6.5.3 Command Function Design Control Table 

Table 6-5 is a typical design control table for the uplink command iunction. 
It consists of two parts the carrier channel and the command channel. Tlie 
sipnal-to-noise ratio in relation to the bandwidth for botli channels must exceed 
their respective throsliolds for the command link to be established.

Spacecraft Radio 
Frequency Subsystem 

Man K. Tarn and Carroll F. Winn 



7.1 Introduction 

The flight Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFS) is a vital component for the 
tJaree spacecraft telecommunications functions of tracking, command, and 
telemetry. It is the radio and the signal processing equipment residing in the 
spacecraft that interfaces with the Control & Data Subsystem and performs 
two-way communications witli tiie earth-based Deep Space Networli, The 
RFS consists of all the elements for RF reception, demodulation, modula- 
tion, and transmission, including those for command detection and telemetry 
modulation. 

This chapter reviews briefly die historical background for the development 
of tlie planetary RFS, and describes the performance capabilities of the various 
functional subassemblies. 



7.2 Historical Background 

Since the initiation of the nation's space exploration program in tlie late 
fifties, the spacecraft RFS design has experienced several stages of evolution,

OF POOR QUAUTY 

both in parametric improvement and in component technology brcaktiirougli, 
Wliilc no dramatic changes in microwave linrdware have been evlilenccd during 
the brief history of the spacecraft radio development, the progress of tlie flight 
RFS iias been dominant in the areas of the transponder and power amplifier 
design. Tlie continual increase in the carrier frequency, increase in RF power 
amphficr output, and improved modulation tecliniques Jiavc all contributed 
to the improved performance of tlie telecommunications links. 



During the infant period of tlie space program exemplified by the Pioneer 
and Ranger missions, tlie RFS consisted of an L-band radio and a three-watt 
cavity amplifier. The Mariner-class spacecraft of tlie sixties and early seventies 
witnessed the implementation of the S-band link, and traveling-wave tube 
amplifiers (TWTA) prevailed in obtaining RF power amplification. It was not 
until tlie Mariner 73 and the Viking 75 missions that an X-band experimental 
transmitter was introduced. Prior to tlie Viking era, the fliglit RFS was con- 
structed predominantly with discrete component parts. 

A major advancement in RFS fabrication was attained shortly after tlic 
Viking launch when a niiriaturc transponder replaced its discrete component 
counterpart for the Voyager 77 mission. The miniature transponder was the 
forerunner of the NASA standard transponder which was developed subse- 
quently. The Voyager RFS also marked tlie beginning of tlie full-up S/X-band 
dual frequency downlink capabilities, and solid-state RF iuiipliners (SSA) had 
reached tlie maturity to compete seriously with the TWTAs for planetary 
applications. This generation of RFS is expected to service the Galileo mission 
scheduled to launch in 1985. 



Up to the miniature transponder era, the command detector unit (CDU) 
and the telemetry modulation unit (TMU) had been implemented separately 
as tlie Modulation Demodulation Subsystem (MDS). However, due to tlie 
technological breakthrough in large-scale integration of digital circuitry, it was 
possible to incorporate tlie CDU in the transponder proper when the NASA 
standard planetary transponder was developed late in the seventies. The stan- 
dard transponder had been chosen by tlie International Solar Polar Mission 
and the Halley Intercept Mission, and will likely be employed by new projects 
started during tliis decade. 



Willie the standard transponder does not include the TMU, it is conceivably 
a simple task (as well as a cost-effective one) to combine tlie TMU into tlie 
RFS implementation. This arrangement will likely be favored for future fliglit 
projects. Tliercfore, tliis document includes the CDU and TMU as parts of tlie 
RFS description. 



384 



Tlie next generation of RFS transponder is now being investigated. Features 
of tlie new transponders will probably include an X-band receiver and an adap- 
tive phase-locked loop witli digital control. 

Aside from the transponder and power-amplifier domains, the RFS has also 
seen significant changes in the modulations of the information channels. Tlie 
ranging channel iias evolved from its primitive tone-runging scliemc to PN 
sequence and to the current sequential-ranging implementation. The command 
and telemetry channels have also progressed from tlic simple FM system to the 
advanced pulse-code-modulation schemes. Data rates on both links are much 
higher tlian they used to be especially on the telemetry link where megabit 
capability is now forthcoming. Sophisticated coding techniques are also imple- 
ment"- for tlic telemetry channels. 



7.3 RFS Description 

Tl\e RFS comprises the following principal subassemblies; 

(1) S/X-band transponder 

(2) S-band power amplifier 

(3) X-band power amplifier 

(4) Command detector unit (CDU) 

(5) Telemetry modulation unit (TMU) 

(6) Control and hiterface unit 

Complementary microwave hardware such as switches, diplexers, filters, and 
hybrids provide the arcliitecturc for the desired RFS configuration. 

7.3.1 RFS Block Diagram 

A typical RFS block diagram is shown in Fig. 7-1. This configuration is 
applicable to llie dual-antenna spacecraft (usually a low-gain and a higli-gain 
antenna) prevalent in past projects. For other antenna subsystem arrangements, 
RF switches and diplexers may be changed to provide the proper signal patlis. 
Redundant subassemblies are indicated in the diagram to reflect compliance 
of tlie traditional planetary mission's requirement tliat no single failure shall 
cause tlie loss of any required spacecraft function. Failure detection is provided 
to allow switching to the redundant units, 

7.3.2 RFS Functional Operation 

As shown in Fig. 7-1, the S-band uplink signal is directed to tlie transponder 
receivers from tlie antenna subsystem via tlic appropriate diplexers and t!je RF

lo-noise ratio and the signal reiliiclion in a bandpass liinlter liavo been analyzed 
by a number of authors. One ol" the first was Davenport [7-K] who studied 
the variation in an output signal as a function ol input signal-to-noise ratio. He 
found that the loss in output SNR is small for any input SNR less than one. 
Tlic limiting value of this loss is about 1 .05 dB. 

Tauswortlie [7-5] developed a convenient and very close approximation for 
signal suppression, which is given by: 



' 0,7,S54/M' 0.4708/'; 
1 + 1.024/; + 0.4(.7tS/>* 



where Pj ~ lintiter input signal-to-noise ratio. This works well over the region of 
interest in most transponder problems, I'or a complete analysis of tlie bandpass 
liniiter in a I'LL see the work done by I indsey |7-2] . 

Tlic receiver's 1I-" amplification is gain-controlled in the early stages and 
limited, as discussed above, in the stages before the carrier is detected. Input 
signal powers may vary I'rom -1 54 to -70 dBm, giving an 84-ilB range. To assure 
that limiting occurs only in stages designed as limiters, and to provide a linear 
ranging channel, automatic gain control (AGO of the carrier signal is used. The 
AGC error signal is produced by a pltase detector wltose reference is shifted 
^)0 deg from die carrier PPl. phase-detector's reference. The signal used for 
ACiV is picked off before the limiters. The ACIC loop acts as a first-order loop 
with a bandwidth in the order of 1 11/. For an analysis of the AGC loop see 
[7.1], [7-21, and [7-4]. 

7.3..1.I.2 liijiigiti!; dhviiu'l. In addition to maintaining a carrier lock, the trans- 
ponder is also required to handle the ranging sigisal. The ranging signal is 
detected by a separate phase detector in phase with the carrier phase-locked loop 
in a wide-band channel. Due to changes in modidation indexes on the uplink 
carrier, changes in distance to tlie spacecraft, and the wide chatme! bandwidth, 
the ranging signal is gain-controlled with a limiter or a second AGC loop after 
it is separated from the carrier channel. Tlie channel separation takes place just 
after the last stage that is controlled by the carrier AGC. 

\Vlien AGC is used to control the ranging signal, the total power (signal 
plus noise) in the langing channel is delected using a sijuaredaw detector. The 
current transponders use ranging eliannels with about l,S X ID* 11/ noise band- 
widtlis, which results in SNRs loss than one for most tanging-signal levels. Since

employed which ililler in the dioice ol' suboatricr frequency. The Vikin^v 
vintage SlMl^ suhcarrier vetsion is used witli the Voyai^er-class miniature trans- 
ponder. Ilie command suhcarrier is delected idoni^ with tlie carrier in the pltase- 
locked loop where the command signal is split oil" before the loop llltcr. A 
disadvantajw of this jiietliod is that the commatui sipnal cannot he completely 
eliminated from tl>e carrier loop and an undesircd I'cedthroufh is experienced 
on the downlink as tiie releience Vt'O frequency is beinp. multiplied. The 
degradation on the \-han>i downlink due to conmumd fsedtiuounh is quite 
pronounced. Another disadvantajie is that the command bit rate is limited to 
25ti bps because of Ihe low suhcarrier frequency. 

The second version is the lit-kll/ .suhcarrier which is used with the NASA 
standard transponder. A conunaml rate of 2 kbps is possible and the command 
feedthroui'.ir problem is eliminated. The conuuand signal, however, must be 
detected in a separate channel in the same manner as rangini',. The detected 
composite command sipnal is routed to a command detector for data recovery, 

7,.V3.1.4 I'xdtcrs. There are two exciters lan S-band and an X-bandl used in 
Ihe transponder and they employ the siune design concept. An exciter is 
a series of frequency multipliers which bring the transponder reference fre- 
quency to the desired downlink frequency, Within the ntuliiplier chain, a phase 
modulator is implemented to permit modulation ot Ihe ranging and./or the 
telemetry data. Tigurc 7-2 shows the construction (schematicallyl of tlie two 
exciters. The modulating .ignals are llrst combined by a summing amplitler 
before being applied to the pliase modulator. In the S-band and ihe X-band 
exciters, the phase modulatois are operating in the low "Imndred-Mll/" region 
which allows low Indexe:; to he modulated. The Irequency multiplication that 
t'ollows increases ilie indexes bv the faciov of the multiplication ratio. In this 
lashion. tlie transponder is able to provide modulation of square wave in excess 
of 'HI deg, 

7.3,3.2 Power nmpliflers. As pointed out previously, two types of RF power 
ampliliets have been and continue to be used tor planetary missions. They arc 
the TWTA and (lie .S\SA. Despite the tedious and souietiiiie.s difnoiili procedures 
in trimming Ihe ampliriers to the required specillcations. an RI- amplifier is in 
tact, configuratively speaking, a relatively simple device. For the TWTA. it 
consists of a power supply to provide the various voltages required for TWT 
operations and a traveling-wave tube which performs the RF power amplifica- 
lion. Tlie SSA consists of a power converter and a solid-state amplifier. Some 
supplementary circuits are provided for power swiitching and other housekeeping 
purpo.ses.

ORIGINAL r:-..^'. 

OF POOR QUAU'tV 

The RF ampUficrs are used to raise the exciter outputs to a power level 
sufficient for RF transmission. Different amplifiers must be designed for differ- 
ent frequency bands. At the present time, S-band TWTAs up to 28 watts, 
X-band TOTAs up to 20 watts, and S-band SSAs up to 20 watts have all been 
flown. 

7.3,3.3 Command detector unit. As with the case of the transponder, there 
are also two command detector versions currently in use for planetary missions, 
Tliey are the Viking Heritage CDU which is compatible with tlie Voyager-class 
transponder and the NASA standard CDU which was developed with and became 
an integral part of the NASA standard transponder. Since both transponder-CDU 
combinations will be used in future missions, botli CDUs are described. 

7,3,3,3.1 Viking Heritage CUD. The Viking CDU is the first generation of all- 
digital bit synchronizers used for spacecraft command-detection purposes. Tlie 
only analog elements in the detector are the front-end sivnal-conditioning 
circuits and the analog-to-digital converter. The command baseband signal for 
the Viking CDU consists of a 512-Hz subcatrier modulated by the bit sync which 
in turn is modulated by the data bits. The composite command signal may be 
represented by 

composite command signal = SC^BSi>0 

where 

SC is tlic 512-IIz subcarrier 

BS is tlie 5 12/^j-Hz bit sync or clock, /! = 2 to 512 in binary steps 
D is data bits 

In order to detect the command bits, two levels of synchronization, sub- 
carrier sync and clock sync, must first be established. To accomplish these 
synchronizations, tlie transmitted commands are prefixed first by a short burst 
of unmodulated subcarrier, followed by a period of subcarrier modulated by 
bit sync. Hence, tlie detections of subcarrier, bit sync, and data are performed 
sequentially with a multimode ccrrelation process. In other words, the CDU 
first establishes subcarrier lock when the unmodulated subcarrier is present; 
then it uses the detected subcarrier to extract the bit sync during the period 
when no data (STC' BS only) are present. Finally, th? knowledge of 5Candi?5 
enables the CDU to detect data bits when they subsequently appear. The tliree- 
level (SC, BS, and data) detection process is accomplished by means of digital 
correlation. A block diagram for the CDU and a detection flow diagram are 
given in Fig. 7-5 and Fig. 7-6, respectively.

and the /edundent power amplifier inputs. The switch is a signal-directing 
device. Ferrite circulating switches are commonly used in the RFS. In general, 
there is no standard configuration for the microwave components, as they are 
mission-dependent.

8.1 Introduction 

The theoretical foundations of antennas rest on Maxwell's equations pre- 
sented before the Royal Society of London in 1864 by James Clerk Maxwell 
(1831-1879). These equations have proven to be one of mankind's greatest 
discoveries for predicting and describing nature's electromagnetic phenomena. 
In 1886 ITeinrich Hertz (1857-1894) was able to verify experimentally tiie 
existence of electromagnetic phenomena and their propagation characteristics. 
This added a now chapter to human history since the electromagnetic spec- 
trum, outside tlie visible region, could be employed for communication pur- 
poses through the use of radio. Figure 8-1 presents the names of some renowned 
scientists who contributed to the advancements and applications of the theory 
of electromagnetism in the era spanned from Gilbert to Einstein [8-1] . 

A radio antenna is a device for radiating or receiving electromagnetic waves 
which provides a transition between a free-space wave and a guided wave (re- 
ceiving) or vice versa (transmitting). The electromagnetic characteristics of 
antennas can be accurately predicted using Maxwell's equations. Since the 
science of antennas is mature, there are numerous publications c!evoted to 
this topic and the interested reader is referred to some of the most recent ones

[8-^ tluough 8-8l. As technolopical nceJs liave ilcinaiidcd more advimced 
antennas, many newly developed analytical, niimoriL\il and experitneiital metli- 
ods liavo emerged, and a variety of antenna conngiiraliiHis have been built and 
examined, Anunig them one may refer to linear antennas, Iob periodic antennas, 
iuirn antennas, relleetor antennas, arrays, lenses, jnlcrostrip antennas, etc. 
Obviously, not all of these can bo examined here, and it is the responsibility 
of the design engineer to keep himself updated to make sure that the cluvoc 
of mitenna is optimum lor the task. 

In this section, a tutorial description is piven for spacecraft antennas used 
for decp-space-to-earth communication. For this reason, this discussion is 
focused primarily on reflector antennas as tliey are used most frequently in 
deep-space spacecraft. The objective is to present sonie lundaruontal detlni- 
tions, tables, and graphs to enable the system enpijieer to originate a prelimiriaiy 
design for a specified task. The discussion is by no means exhaustive, and the 
user must consult more detailed sources and references to reluie a design. 



8.2 Radiation Pattern Parameters 

8.2.1 Radiation Pattern, Beamwidths and SIdelobes 

To jiernut the transfer of information between a spacecraft and earth, (he 
radio signal is radiated into space by an antenna. Tlie radiation characteristics 
of an antenna as a function of direction are given by lire antenna pattern. By the 
principle of reciprocity, this pattern is the same for both receiving and trans- 
mitting conditions in most circumstances. Tlie simplest antenna, hypothetlcally 
speaking, is the isotropic radiator, which distributes the radiated power uni- 
formly into space. Thus, for a total radiated power of ll'^, one observes a radi- 
ation intensity of 

W 

per unit solid angle independent of the angular position with respect to this 
hypothetical antenna. However, with a known target direction or directions, it 
becomes desirable to concentrate the radiated power into specific areas. For 
this purpose, a directional antenna may be designed so that t!ie radiation inten- 
sity is a function of (lie direction 

If the radiation intensity pattern is measured at a sufficient distance from 
tire antenna (.typically larger than 21)' l\, where D = antenna diameter and 
X " wavelength) so that an increase in distance causes no change in the relative 
intensity, the pattern will be the far-field pattern. Closer measurements yield 
Fresnel and near-field patterns which are functions of botli angle and distance.

pattern. This is an important observation since the use of increasingly large 
antennas (in terms of waveloneth) makes it difficult to measure their tttic 
far-field patterns iisinp standard far-field ranges. In the discussion of this section, 
only the far-Ocld patterns arc considered.

Tiie pattern may be expressed in terms of tlio field intenstty (field pattern) 
or in terms of the Poynting vector or radiation intensity (power patterns), Tiie 
latter is used most often. A typical antenna power pattern is shown in Fig. 8-3 
as a polar plot in linear units, and is shown in Fip. tJ-4 in rectangular coordi- 
nates on a dB scale. The latter presentation shows the minor-lobe structure in 
more detail. In most eases, the main lobe is t!ie desired lobe and, thus, tlie 
sidelobes are tlie minor lobes. Typically, tlie sidelobes liave alternately positive 
and negative values. In fact, tlic far field in its most general form may be com- 
plex-valued and its magnitude and piiase will then be used to define the power 
and phase patterns. A single pattern (single cut) would be sufficient to com- 
pletely specify tiie angular variation in tlie radiation pattern provided tlie pattern 
is symmetric. If the pattern is not symmetric, a three-dimensional diagram or 
contour plot will be required to show the pattern in its entirety. However, in 
practice, two patterns (one tlirougli the narrowest part of the lobe; the other, 
perpendicular to it tlirougli the widest part of the lobe) may suffice. These 
mutually perpendicular patterns tlirough Uie main-lobe axis are called the 
principal-plane patterns and, based on their polarizations, sometimes are referred 
to as tiie li- and //-plane patterns. Since one encounters vector fields when 
working witli antennas, tliere are occasions for referring to the copolar and 
cross-polar patterns in order to demonstrate two orthogonally polarized com- 
ponents of the far field.

An important numerical specification of tlie pattern is t!ie angular width of 
tlie main lobe at a particular level. The angle at the half-power level or half- 
power beannvidth (HPBW) is most commonly used and defined as 

where Sffp ,gj-f and Of^p ^^,,f are angies at half-power levels down from tlie left 
and riglit of the peak, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8-3. The antenna HPBW can

be different in different pattern cuts for nonsymmetric patterns. Also defined 
are tlie beamwidth between first nulls (BWFN) or the beamwidth at -10 or 
-20 dB below the pattern maximum. Another important parameter is sidelobe 
level, which is the ratio of the pattern value of a sidelobe peak to the pattern 
value of the main lobe peak and typically is expressed in dB, For example, in 
Fig. 84 tlie first sidelobe level is at -24 dB. 

8.2.2 Directivity, Gain, and Aperture Efficiency 

An im^ ^rtant characteristic of an antenn?. is how well it concentrates energy 
in one direction with reference to radiation in other directions. Tiiis ciiaracter- 
istic is most easily described using the Poynting vector concept defined as 

P = E X H* (8.2-2) 

whore E and H are the electric and magnetic fields and * designates t!»e con- 
jugate operator. The total average power radiated by an antenna is 

W^ = -~ Rej f{E X H *) • r (/£i (8.2-3) 

in whicli ris tlie unit vector in the propagation direction, t/fl defines the differ- 
ential of the solid angle, and Re is the operator whicli takes the real part of a 
complex number. Furtliermore, tlie radiation intensity can be defined as 

£/(S2) =\ReiEX H*) • r^r (8.24) 

where i^ is introduced to make t/(f2) independent of distance. Furthermore, 
using (8.2-3) in (8.2-1) one can obtain the average radiated power. The direc- 
tivity pattern is now defined as 

Diil) = -^ (8.2-5) 

and its maximum value, called directivity, is given by 

D = max [Z)(J2)] (8.2-6) 

which is typically in tlie main beam direction. 

The directivity is solely determined by tire radiation pattern of an antenna. 
However, when an antenna is used in a system (say, transmitting), one is actually 



419 



OF POOR Ql 



interested in knowing how efficiently the antenna transforms available power at 
its input tenninals to radiated power in a particular direction. Obviously, be- 
cause of resistive losses, the radiated power is always less than the total input 
power. To this end, power gain (or simply gain) is defined as 4jr times the ratio 
of the radiation intensity in a given direction to tlie net power accepted by the 
antenna from tite connected transmitter; i.e., 

C(n) = ^^ (8.2-7) 

where lf,„ is the input power (tliis definition does not include losses due to 
mismatches of impedance). The maximum value of power gain, called gain, 
is 

G = max [OiSl)] (8.2-8) 

which is typically m the main beam direction. 

Comparison of (8.2-5), (8.2-1), and (8.2-7) prompts one to define radiation 
efficiency, e, as

where

From (8.2-10) one concludes tliat tlie maxhnum power gain of an antenna is 
equal to its purely directional characteristic of directivity reduced by its radia- 
tion efficiency. Furthermore, one can easily establish that 



ffG{n)i 



>dn = 4iT e (8.2-12)

Unrariuiialcly, the tctminoloiiy found in the literature is iiimnisistenl on tlie 
topics of Jirecliviiy and pain, nnd tlicy are often confused ^ind sometimes used 
interdianseahly. Thus, the reader should be careful to understand the proper 
iisape. 

I'or aperture-type antennas, the pain can be related to tiie peometrical area 
of the aperture by the following well-known expression: 

a ^ v„^ ^-^ .1,, (8.2.14)

t* = radiation efficiency due to oluiiic losses, which are usually very 
small, except for lossy devices included as part of tire feed system. 

T?^ = aperture taper efficiency d 'c to the gain losses based on an aperture 
illumination that is tapered relative to uniform illumination, which 
produces mii\imum gain. For example, Fig. [>5 (from [S-?]) shows 
the variation o\'v, as a function of illumination taper, 

V^ = spillover (or feed") efficiency due to tire portion of the feed radia- 
tion which is not intercepted by the reflector. As the aperture taper 
incre.isos, the spillover decreases while the aperture taper efficiency 
tjj decreases. The litidcotf between i?^ and t), has an optimum solu- 
tion as indicated by the combined curve in Fig, 8-5. Typically, this 
optimum solution occurs at about -1 1 dB cdpe taper [8-7] , and tlie 
value of -10 dB edge taper is frequently quoted. 

i7j = random surface error efficiency due to surface mis errors. Tliis 
efficiency can be obtained from 

t7j = p-W^fiW^ (8.2-16) 

where 6 is the surface rms error and k is a factor which depends on 
the f/D ratio as shown in Fig. 8-6. 

t}^ = aperture blockage efficiency duo to the presence of a feed system or 
a subrefiector. Values of tjj are given in Fig, 8-7 as a function of tlie

parameters of tlio patterns as sliown in Table 8-2, These patterns and tabu- 
lated data can be used as a good approximation for many reflector antenna 
patterns in tlie angular regions close to Uie main beam. 

In order to demonstrate tlie applicability of tlie foregoing simple expres- 
sions, a realistic case of tlie Viking Orbitor higli-gain antenna is discussed. The 
geometry of this antenna is shown in Fig. 8-12. The antenna diameter is 2a = 
58 mches and tlie operating frequency is set at X-band (/= 8.415 GHr.). The 
far-field patterns of this reflector as measured in two different cuts are shown 
in Fig, 8-13. Clearly, owing to tlie effects of tlic struts and otlier components, 
tlie patterns in two planes are not tlie same; however, they demonstrate similar 
features, particularly about tlie main beam. These measurements are obtained 
bv botii measuring the antenna in a standard outdoor far-field range, and also 
in tlie near-field range, using a new technique developed by Rahmat-Samii, 
et al. [8-10], Tills tcclinique is finding an ever-increasing application in measur- 
hig tlie far-field patterns and gain of btge directive (high-gain) antennas. Fig- 
ure 8-14 demonstrates the basic experimental setup of this near-field procedure. 
The prime advantages of tlie near-field technique are: (1) tlie antenna can be 
measured in the controlled environment, and (2) true far-field patterns can be 
obtained independent of tlie size of tlic antenna. Briefly explained, the near- 
field amplitude and phase data of tlie antenna are measured in a distance typi- 
cally less than a diameter. These data are then used via some computer programs 
[8-10] to generate the true fa--field patterns of the antenna. As shown in 
Fig. 8-13, the comparison between the far-field patterns using the near-field 
technique and the direct far-field measurement is very good. The gain of this 
antenna is 38.8 dB with an aperture efficiency of Ji^p = 44.91%, which includes

evident, a good approxitnalion lor the actual pattern is obtained in the main 
beam region. Note tlial due to the blockage effects, the sidelobes cannot bo 
accurately predicted by the simple model. It is worthwhile to mention that 
the simple model presented by (8,2-18) is based on a simpliiled scalar descrip- 
tion of circular reflector antennas. There are vector-diffraction analysis tech- 
niques available which accmatoly predict both the copolar and cross-polar 
patterns of leficctor antennas. The reader may refer to [8-2] or to tlie more 
recent works of Rahniat-Saniii, et al. [8-1 1 and 8-1 2] . 

Although equation (8.2-18^ provides a first-cut estimate of the pattern, on 
many occasions it will be useful to have a ijuick estimate of thereficctor's gain 
and beamwidth. Table 8-,i provides such information for a variety of antentias.

8.2.4 Choice of Antenna 

For a telecommunications system, one of the least expensive methods of 
obtaining increased performance per dB is to vary the antenna gain, provided 
proven antenna types are used, The only otlier metliod tliat rivals antenna choice 
is bit rate, but this is generally set by otlier system requirements. For a given 
power-gain product tiiere is a particular combination of antenna gain and trans- 
mitter power at which the spacecraft weight is minimized. Thus, in weight- 
critical vehicles, it may be necessary to increase transmitter power rather than 
antenna gain, despite a possibly higher cost. 

The telecommunications designer must obtain an idea of the minimum 
antenna gahis necessary to accomplisli the mission for each mode by using state- 
of-tlie-art values for spacecraft parameters and tlie committed DSN parameters 
for tlie mission data which provide a starting point for antenna choice. Typical

antenna gain capabilities for several typos of antennas are shown in Fig. 8-16. 
In order to niaximizo the reflector antenna gain, antenna designers have used 
diial-sliaped reflector antennas. The surface of these sliaped reflector antennas 
departs from tlie classical shapes such as the paraboloid (for main reflector) 
and the hyperboloid (for subreflectors). For example, tlie 1977 Voyager space- 
craft used a 3.7-m shapod-dual-reflector system for iiigh data-rate telemetry 
transmission [8-13], The system was optically shaped for higli efficiency at 
X-band. Tlie dichroic sitbreflector was transparent to radiation from an S-band 
prime-focus liorn nestled bcliind it. The geometrical layout of this dual-shaped 
reflector is shown in Fig. 8-17. A photograph of the model is shown in Fig. 8-18. 
Tiie gains of tJiis reflector antenna at X-band and S-band arc 48.2 dB and 
35,3 dB, respectively. 

in order to further improve the pattern characteristics of reflectors and 
eliminate the effects of unwanted struts and subreflcctor blockages, the antenna 
designers have started using the concept of offset (clear aperture) reflector 
antennas [8-14] . This concept is particularly useful when tliere is a need for a 
low sidolobe reflector design such as satellite cominunication antennas [8-2 
and 8-12],

8.3 Pointing Errors 

The maximuiH spacecraft tolecomntunications pcrformancG is olUafned wlien 
tlic target is aligned witli Uie maximum-gain point of the stiacecrafl antenna. It 
is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain exact tarpet tracking. Therefore, an 
acceptable pointing error is usually specified. This determines the positioning 
reiiiilremcnts for a given antenna. Total pointing error is a function of mission 
time and is usually specified by degrees away from boresight. 

Discussions of pointing error sources and statistics ore presented here, fol- 
lowed by a discussion on pointing loss. Total pointing error and pointing loss 
are analyzed (see appendix) for a spinning spacecraft. The analysis was speci- 
fically developed for the Galileo spacecraft, but adaptation to similar pointing 
dynamics is simple. 

8.3.1 Pointing Control Errors 

A change in target positions over the antenna gain pattern occurs witJi mis- 
sion time due to the basic limitations of the antenna pointing system. For 
example; 

(1) For a fixed antenna position, the spacecraft-to-earth vector is aligned 
with the peak gain for only short periods of time. 

(2) For a single-axis pointing system, tlie antenna docs not track eartli 
exactly. 

(3) In a discrete pointing system, pointing error will occur because of non- 
continuous position updating, 

(4) Optimizhig antenna position for a range of trajectories may result in 
pointing errors for a oarticidar fiiglit vcfiiclc trajectory. 

Spinning antennas also suffer from: 

(5) Misalignment between the medianical borcsight and spacecraft spin 
axis. 

(6) Misalignment between tlic antenna electrical and mechanical boresiglit,

for attitude determination - drifts beyond the deadband, the spacecraft re- 
orients itself toward eartii. 

These pointing errors are not errors in the usual sense. They are planned 
deviations from peak antenna gain to lower costs and increase the reliability of 
tlie antenna subsystem. Since they are due to limitations in the ability to control 
tlie antenna pointing direction, they are referred to as pointing control errors, 

8.3.2 Pointing Knowledge Errors 

There are several types of errors that contribute to uncertainty in pointing 
direction and iience to antenna pointing error. These are referred to as pointing 
knowledge errors. 

Some pointhiB knowledge errors occur because the positions of the higli-gain 
antenna and the attitude sensing devices tliat detect the correct spacecraft 
orientation are not precisely known. Other pointing knowledge errors are due 
to limitations in ability to resolvo sensor outputs, '^'ise errors result in an 
antenn."* attitude tliat differs slightly from the noi. ition in an unpredict- 

able way. For a typical vehicle, tiiese errors include; 

(1) Alignment uncertainty between the mechanical boresiglit and the space- 
craft principal axis. 

(2) Alignment uncertamty between the antenna electrical and the mechani- 
cal boresight. 

(3) Sun sensor alignment uncertainty. 

(4) Star tracker alignment uncertainty. 

(5) Sun sensor digital resolution. 

(6) Star tracker digital resolution. 

8.3.3 Pointing Error Statistics 

Each contributor to pointing error must have a probabiHty distribution asso- 
ciated witli it which translates to antenna clock and cone coordinate distributions. 
The sum of these angular errors forms the uncertainty component of pointing 
error. By combining tlie probability distributions of all contributions to pointing 
error appropriately, tlie probability density function p^(6) of the total off- 
boresiglit pomting error can be computed. 



8.4 Pointing Loss 

Pointing loss is found by locatmg tlie spacecraft-earth vector on the antenna 
pattern. The magnitude of this vector is referred to as the pointing error, which 

438 



OF POOn QJALr^V 

is discussed in Section 8.3. Nominal pointing loss, usually called pointing loss, is 
determined by 

P^ = G(0,*)-G,„ (8.4-1) 

where G(0, 0) is the nominal antenna gain function in dE, 6 is the antenna cone 
angle and (l> the antenna clock angle of the spacecraft-earth vector, and G^ is 
the nominal peak antenna gain in dB. 

The mean pointing loss Pj^ is defined as the expected value of pointing loss 

^L " //[^(^> ^) - '^», 3 P^^' <^) "^^ '^'^ (8.4-2) 

where p^{0^ 0) is the joint probability density function of fl and <j>. 
The variance a]^ of the pointing loss is tlien 

ol = //[G(e, 0) - G J ^ p^{B, 0) d6 d<t, - -Pl (8.4-3) 

P^ and o]^ are inserted into the telecommunication link design control t-ible 
(DCT) to account for the pointing loss degradations of the link. As an example, 
the pointing loss statistics of the Galileo spacecraft liigh-gain antenna arc derived 
in the appendix. 

8.5 Polarization Loss 

The gain function of an antenna does not completely characterize its per- 
formance. G{Q, 0) includes infomiation on tlie magnitude of the electric field 
vectors of tlie antenna radiation, but discards information as to their relative 
phase. An antenna transmits an E field in a preferred way which can be described 
by the polarization factor p of the wave at each point in space, where p = EylE^ 
in a known coordinate system. By the principle of reciprocity, a receiving 
antenna will select incoming waves of the polarization of its transmit pattern 
and discard all others (the antenna is said to have a polarization paitern). The 
ratio of tlie power delivered to the antenna terminals /*^ to the power P^^^g 
received by an antenna matched to the incident polarization is called the polari- 
zation efficiency, t>^ viz 

^ = -—- (8.5-1) 



439 



OF POOR QUAUTV 

This is also refened to as polarization loss, measured in dB, and it must be 
added to tlie transmission equation to obtain the true received power. 

In general, p is a function of tJie coordinate system chosen, and is a complex 
number. In practice, the antenna is usually designed so that orthogonal £'-vector 
components are 90 deg out of pliase with one another in time. In this case, the 
E vector describes an ellipse witli major axis /?, and minor axis R^. For this 
case, 

where / = \/-T \\aAAR is called tlie axial ratio. The sign denotes the direction of 
£'-vector rotation. The term elliptictty is used to express the axial ratio in dB, 
where 

ellipticity = 20 log,;, AR (8.5-2) 

Generally, the antenna is characterized by a gain pattern and an ellipticity 
pattern [8-15] . For example, Fig. 8-19 shows tlie polarization characteristics of 
an antenna as a function of the ratio parameter p. For AR = 1, ihe ^vector 
traces a circle, resulting in a circular polarization. If the E vector rotates counter- 
clockwise to an observer looking from tlie receiver to the source, p = -/, and tlie 
wave is rigiit-circularly polarized (RCP). For p = j, the wave is left-circularly 
polarized (LCP), Circular polarization is usually desirable for deep-space com- 
munication because, ideally, a change in orientation of the spacecraft antenna 
with respect to the target antenna causes no polarization loss. However, for 
application to landers, or for certain atmospheric experiments, other considera- 
tions may dominate. For example, under certain conditions tlie multipath 
from a lander transmitting RCP will be almost entirely LCP and may be rejected 
by an RCP antenna. 

All antennas have some ellipticity. It may be shown [8-4] that the polariza- 
tion loss in dB between two antennas with gains specified relative to radiators 
with perfectly matched polarizatiOii can be written as 

(1 + /?P (1 + 4) + 4 ;? jj?^ + (1 - /?^) (1 - 4) cos 2*

In geneial, one does not know the relative orientation of the polarization

pattern repeats since the angular factor is 2*). The mean and variance can be 
computed from (8.5-3) or (8.54) by assuming a uniform density function for ^I'. 



8.6 Antenna Noise Temperature 
and Noise Spectral Density 

The noise power component seen by an antenna is due to electromagnetic 
radiation generated in the antenna bandwidth by 

(1) Celestial bodies within the antenna beam. 

(2) Atmospheric absorption and reradiation. 

(3) Absorption and reradiation by pliysical bodies surrounding the antenna. 

The effective antenna noise temperature is defined by [84] 



wtiere Aq ~ f^.^ G(Sl) d£l, and 71[S2) is the blackbody temperature of the 
environment in the direction f2. At 2 GHz, typical spacecraft values of T^, 
including noise contributions due to surface finish errors and other antenna 
generated sources, are [8-16] 

T = 50 K, no briglit noise sources occupying a significant fraction of the 



ae 



beam 
T. = 200 K, entire beam intercepted by the moon 

"^ae ~ ^^^ ^* *"i*J''^ beam intercepted by the eartli 
T^^ ~ 10,000 K, entire beam intercepted by the sun 

DSN antennas may have noise temperatures at S-band of 15 K or less when 
aimed at a cold sky (no major celestial source) at high elevation angles. At 
X-band, T^^ is greatly increased by the presence of v/ater vapor. Reference 
[8-17] should be consulted for typical values. 

Frequently, the antenna noise temperature is divided into the following two 
components:

T.. = 7,-^T„ (8.64) 

ac g a ^ ' 



This division is particularly useful for ground-based antennas at S-band, since 
for a cold sky and elevation angles greater than 10 degrees Tg is constant and T„ 
is a function of azimuth and elevation of the antenna. At X-band, T„ may be 
modeled as the sum of an input temperature dependent on celestial sources and 
an effective noise temperature r^^, = (Z,^ - 1) T^ due to atmospheric attenua- 
tion, where T^^ is the effective temperature of the atmosphere, L^ is the total 
loss due to energy absorption, and T^ is a density-averaged temperature of the 
atmosphere equal to about 280 to 290 K. This is equivalent to regarding the 
atmosphere as a passive circuit loss. 

For spacecraft antennas, the distinction between T and T^ is not usually 
made, althougli it migiit prove useful for steerable antennas if the spacecraft 
effects are large and variable. 

The noise spectral density Nq at the antenna terminal is 

where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38 X 10~^° mW-sec/K, or - 198.6 dBm/Hz K. 
By definition (8.6-1), antenna gain is included in the computation of T^g, Fre- 
quently, noise contributors such as surface finish errors are lumped into Tg^, 
since there is no effective way to separately measure these sources when mea- 
suring t;^. 



8.7 Flight Environment 

Mounting antennas on a spacecraft changes their patterns and introduces 
interference effects which can be estimated and measured, A typical spacecraft 
mounts at least two antennas of tlie same design frequencies. These are con- 
nected by circulator switches to the same receiver. Because of line mismatches 



443 



OF POCu Cv.--'.»'VV 

and imperfect switches, some fraction of power into the receiver comes from 
the antenna tliat is not in use. Similarly, in transmission a fraction of tlie power 
transmitted comes from the nonoperating antenna. Since the patli lengths 
traveled from tlie antenna to the receiver arc different, the signals will not be 
in phase when they are summed. Thus, an interferometer effect will occur. 

Figure 8-20 gives a model for interferometer equations, where

function of time to ensure that no fades deep enough to cause loss of lock 
develop. In addition, for a large effect, the assumption of Gaussian noise breaks 
down, and the statistics of data reception must be reexamined. 

The above analysis can be easily extended to more than two antennas by add- 
ing tlie appropriate received voltages.

Antenna Pointing AYtailysis 
for Spinning Spacecraft 

Shiomo Dolinsky 



In this appendix the calculation uf the total pointing error for a spinning 
spacecraft is summarized. The analysis is developed for the special ease of the 
Galileo Orbiter X-band high-gain antenna. However, it can be adapted to space- 
craft with similar pointing dynamics. 

1. Galileo Pointing Errors 

The Galileo Orbiter is a dual-spun spacecraft with a spinninghigh-gain antenna 
and as such 1ms pointing dynamics different from a three-axis stabilized space- 
craft. Table A-1 lists the errors common to spacecraft in dual- and all-spin mode. 
Tliese values are mission-specific and were introduced for computational pur- 
poses. Additional errors unique to other missions can be accommodated in a 
lilte manner. 

An explanation of each error follows: 

(1) Angular momentum (H). Tiie spacecraft angular momentum vector H 
should ideally be aligned with the spacecraft-earth line. In practice, it is 
impossible to prevent some drift of the spin axis with respect to earth.

the exception of the dcadband, which is deterministic.

Tlierefore, a certain amount of drift is permitted. Tlic spacecraft attitude 
control system penerales an estimate ^7 of (he anpiilar momentum vector 
to determine wlien this vector lias drifted outside a predefined range, tiie 
dcadband. 

(2) Deadband (A). Flie HGA deadbf.nd controls tJie maximum earth-antenna 
drift offset. As time passes, the angular momentum-earth angle widens. 
When i<n estimate /? of the angular momentum vector H is larger Ihpn *he 
deadband, tlie Galileo Orbitor motors are fired to reorient liie spacecraft 
back toward the eartli. 

(3) Attitude determination error (C), This is the knowledge error associated 
with estimating the attitude of the angular momentum vector H, It con- 
sists of errors due to computation, drift, resolution, etc., in the gyros, 
start-scanner, scan platform, and accclerometers. These units are periodi- 
cally calibrated in fliglit (every 100 to 200 days), and the updates are 
incorporated into the onboard coiitroi algorithm. In tiiis way built-up 
biases arc eliminated. 

(4) Nutation (N). Nutation is the name given to the circular motion traced 
out by tlie principal axis of inertia under torquing actions {see Fig. A-1). 
It rotates at a rate approximately 30 percent higlier Uian the spacecraft 
spin rate and is dependent on torques from sources such as scan platform 
slewing or motor firing. Dampers attenuate the nutation, reducing it to a 
steady-state value. Once the torquing action stops, the dampers will com- 
pletely remove any residual nutation. 

(5) Wobble (VV), This is an error introduced by cenler-of-gravity offsets and 
non-zero cross products of inertia. It rotates at the spacecraft spin rate 
(see Fig. A-1) and cannot be reduced without a reorientation of space- 
craft mass. 

(6) Mechanical misalignments (M). These errors are a result of structural 
misalignments In the antenna and the antenna mounting. 

(7) Electrical misalignment (E). This error is due to misalignment of the 
mechanical boreslght and the electrical boresight. 

Figure A-2 illustrates tlie relative positions of these errors. In Fig. A-3 the 
magnitude and direction of these errors Is shown projected onto the XY plane 
tangent to the unit sphere centered at point as illustrated in Fig. A-2. The 
total pointing error is

Tlie magnitude (W + M + El is also Rayieigh, thus (A-5a) and (A-5b)

3. Choosing Design, Adverse, 
and Favorable Pointing Errors 

Selecting appropriate design values and tolerances for the total pointing loss 
moans that all possible pointing configurations must be considered. The philoso- 
phy applied to Galileo has three different configurations for design, adverse, and 
favorable pointing. These, hi turn, define tlie design and tolerances for the 
pointing loss. 

3.1 Design Value 

If tiie Galileo pointing mechanism was error free, the maximum pointing off- 
set would equal the deadband. Thus, tlie design value for pointing error is at least 
as big as 1.64 mrad. 



453 



OF POOR QUAUTY 

F,irthermore, wobble and mechanical and electrical misalignments are actual- 
ized Juring spacecraft construction. At the conclusion of the spacecraft tests, an 
exact measurement of their combined printing offset wDl be available. This deter- 
ministic error will then be added to the deadband. Before manufacturing, these 
errors must bo treated statistically. Together they can be expected to contribute 
to tlie design value a total error equal to the mean of the magnitude of their 
vector sum. 

Finally, the attitude determination error and the nutation occur in random 
directions. When aligned with the aforementioned errors, their contribution is 
greatest. Thus they can each be expected to add the mean of their magnitude to 
the design value. 

Stated matliematically, the potentially worst-case design value pointing error is 
^omoN = ^ + J? (ICI + |N| + !W + M + El) = 2.29 mrad (A-6) 
Tliat is, Ziyj,:s,GN '^ S*^®"^ ^'^ {h-Sz). 

3.2 Adverse Pointing 

The maximum pointing offset on Galileo happens in the unlikely event that 
all errors are aligned. From (A-3) 

The mean plus tliree-sigma value of Z^^^;^ is defined as ^^/jj/^/j^e- Hence, 

^ADVERSE = ^ + a/ -f C'^C + '^AT + <^JV + "m ^ °f'' 



^-3^(^)(a^ + a^ + < + c7^ + 4) (A-7) 

= 3.05 mrad 

3.3 Favorable Pointing 

The worst-case minimum pointing offset on Galileo happens in tlie unlikely 
event that all the errors are aligned away from the deadband toward the earth, 
i.e., toward the center of the deadband. Thus, 

^A./iVCwo„f.c.«) = ^ - (ICI + INI + IWI + IMI + lEI) (A.8)

H as the onboard computer updates it every 7 seconds. Every 500 msec the HGA 
pointing algoritlmi checks to make sure// has not drifted outside of the assigned 
deadband. When this happens, the onboard control system reorients the space- 
craft toward earth and the pointing process repeats. 

The wobble and misalignments cause the Galileo higlt-gain antenna to spin 
about its angular momentum vector H at the spacecraft spin rate. Nutation can 
appear suddenly and in any direction. It induces an additional spin about the H 
vector at a rate 30% above the spacecraft spin rate. With continuous torquing 
applied to the spacecraft, the nutation will settle down to a steady-state value. 
The net effect on the earth-RF beam offset is a circular looping action with a 
variable diameter. 

A simulation has been written to quantify the pointing losses for Galileo, The 
simulation calculates the total pointing error:

OF POOR QlJALiry 

The KGA pointing simulation begins with the choice of an initial start point 
for H, which sits at a Rayleigli 99,737p confidence distance of 0.5 mrad from H 
{see Fig. A-4). C^ and Cy are the initial H vector coordinates used and may be 
cliosen deterministically or according to a per-axis Gaussian distribution with 3 
sigma = 0.5/ 1.15 mrad. As time passes, H drifts to the riglit. In practice, vvhen// 
readies the deadband, a repointing maneuver is executed. Equivalently, tlie pro- 
gram will rcpoint the antenna and start over when H readies D = DEADBAND + 

The first simulation is representative of the adverse case. The initial position 
of H is chosen to be along the .X" axis, and 7? is the sum of wobble plus misalign- 
ments. Values chosen for the pointing error simulations are given in Table A-3 
below, They are chosen to yield a mean plus 3 sigma error of 3.05 mrad (A-7), 
In the second simulation R is the RSS of (mean wobble, mean misalignments) 
and the values are chosen to satisfy {A-6). 

Galileo pointing loss over time is shown in Figs, A-S and A-fi. The former is 
the loss under the unusual condition that all adverse pointing errors are periodi- 
cally aligned, The second is the expected loss over time. Note that the worst-case 
design and worst-case adverse pointing losses of Table A-2 can occur just before 
an antenna repointing maneuver. Since these losses can occur, the philosophy 
behind choosing tlic worst-case design and tolerance values is sound. It will not 
lead to unnecessarily optimistic telemetry predictions. A simulation with favor- 
able pointing was not run since there is little loss with a 0.23-mrad offset.

Chapter 9 

The Prediction of Weather Effects on 

Telecommunications 

Link Performance 

Richard L. Horttor and Shiomo Dolinsky 
9.1 Introduction 

This chapter presents a theoretical model wWch combines the statistical 
description of communications link performance [9-1] with a statistical descrip- 
tion of weather effects. The measured effects of weatlier, namely atmospheric 
attenuation and increase in ground receiver system noise temperature, are addi- 
tive (in decibels). The combined probability density function is therefore the 
convolution of the separate density functions, 

Tlie density function for deep spac; communications link performance (with- 
out weatlier effects) derived in Ciupter 1 of this book has been shown to be 
Gaussian by application of the central limit tlteorem. TJie next step is to derive 
tlic density of the weatncr effects. Both types of weather effects have been 
related to each other and to atmospheric cloud cover [9-2] . Since cloud cover is 
described by cumulative statistics and both weather effects are related to cloud 
cover, weather effects can also be modeled from derived cumulative statistics. 

The statistical descriptions of attenuation and noise temperature derived 
from cloud cover are given in Tables A-1 , A-2, and A-3 and Figs, A-2 through A-8 
of the appendbc. These same figures sliow data measured by a radiometer [9-3 
througli 9-6], These data are useful for two reasons. They represent actual 
measurement of effects (instead of extrapolations of cloud models) and arc less 
pessimistic than the estimates denved from the cloud cover model. 



461 



OF POOR QUALSTV 

At tliis time, only Goldstone, Calif,, has a statistically meaningful collection 
of radiometer data. However, the model is flexible enoueli to accommodate 
future measured statistics at the overseas complexes. 

As a practical example of the theory developed in this chapter, it Is applied 
in detail to the Project Galileo telecommunications link performance predic- 
tions (Section 9.4). "he details of applying the model are rather tedious. How- 
ever, the perfonnance improvements, 0.6 dB and 1.8 dB depending on ground 
station, are significant and justify the labor. 



9.2 Weather Effects at X-Band 

Weather effects described in this chapter relate to downlhik communications 
performance in the 8.4-GHz region of flte spectrum. There are two related 
effects. One is attenuation of tlie received signal; the otiier is an increase in the 
ground rpceivc-r system noise temperature. The relations of the two effects to 
each other and to cloud cover are discussed more completely in [9-2] . 



9.2.1 Atmospheric Attenuatio: of Received Signal Power 

TJie attenuation on received signal power P^ at station elevation angle above 
tiie horizon is denoted by A (0). The value varies with ray path length tlirough 
tlie atmosphere. Consequently, the value A (0) is given approximately by 

A (6) = ^ 9^„ ^ (dB) 5°<0< 90° (9.2-1) 

smtf -^ ' 

where /I (90°) is the value at station zenith. The value v4 (90°) is characterized 
statistically in the appendix, as will be described later. 

The power received at elevation angle 6 is given by 

Prm = ;^ C9.2-2) 



9.2.2 Increase fn Ground Receiver System Noise Temperature 

The increase in system noise temperature at elevation angle is denoted by 
ASNT{0). From [9-2] ASNT(d) is related to attenuation at angle 6 by 



ASNTiO) = 260 • lo-oo^/ioii"'' [i _ icr^mm)no-^ (^ (9,2.3)

where ASNT(9Q°) is the increase at zenith. The value A5A'r(90°) is ciiarac- 
terized statistically in the appendix, as will be described later. 

Receiver noise temperature at elevation angle is given by 

^SYS^<^i = ^0 + ^a + ^EL <^) + ^SNTiO) (9.2-4) 

where TJ, is the RF system temperature, T^ is tlie hot body noise (sun or planet 
In liie antenna beam), T^^iO) is the deterministic increasie caused by ground 
terrain in the antenna side lobes [9-7] and ASNT(0) is the weather component. 

Receiver noise spectral density is given by 

= k[T^ + T^ + Tj,^ (6) + ASNT(e)] (9.2-5) 

where k is Boltzniann's constant. 

The weather-induced change is normalized to the deterministic value at

The composite weather loss factor Yg, will be modeled statistically and com- 
bined with the link performance distribution in later sections. 

9.3 The Stochastic Weather Model 

The weather degradation factor Kg was defined by (9.2-12). It depends on 
noise temperature and attenuation, which are related by (9.2-8) and (9.2-9). 
Since both are random variables (the inherent randomness of weather lias never 
been seriously questioned), the cumulative distribution of Yg can be constructed 
from the cumulative distributions of either system noise temperature increase or 
attenuation. An example follows.

(1 -/Jq) of degradation less than or equal to ^0(90°) is; 0,8.

The above exercise must be performed at each elevation angle because the 
weather losses are elevation dependent. The resulting values of the parameters at 
several elevation angles are listed in Table 9-1, The table includes values at each 
complex (Goldstone, Madrid and Canberra) for annual quarters. 

9.3.2 RatJiometer Data 

Results thus far liave been based on theoretical models relating visually 
observed cloud cover to system temperature increases and attenuation. Two 
objections arise. One cliallenges the theoretical cloud model because direct 
physical measurements would be preferable. The other is practical, namely, that 
accurate cloud cover estimates are possible only duiing daylight hours, Conse- 
quently, half the time little data is available, 

Th" water vapor radiometer answers botli objections. It directly measures 
system noise temperature (increases) from whicli attenuation can be computed, 
and it can operate continuously. At this writing, only Goldstone, Calif,, has a 
reasonably complete statistical base.

TJie density lunutton form a\'P.j.(ZiO)) is illustrated in Fig. 9-4 for Goldstone. 
June to August quarter at several elevation angles. Figure 9-5 does tiie same for 
P.j.[Z{0)). Weather model parameters are listed In Table ^'-2. 

The function Z(0) is the real product of the model. That is, it shows how 
much margin iii dB the design value of a communications link must have at an 
elevation angle in order to maintam a given level of confidence. Clearly, margin 
changes with elevation angle, thougli not significantly at angles above 30 deg, 

By numerically Iterating through (9,4-2), Z(P) may be found in terms of a 
desired confidence level, defined as 1 - Pj^{Z), and the specified model param- 
eters. For the last example, Z(Q) is plotted in Fig. 9-6. It applies to Goldstone in 
the June-August quarter, with weather model parameters specified by Table 9-2. 

9.5 Time-Dependent Statistics and Performance 

Since the weather data base is given only for discrete daily or yearly quarters, 
tlie model parameters can be evaluated only for these periods. To find the total 
degradation Zj.fj.f.^^[iO(t)) for an intermediate time /, the total degradation is 
evaluated at two quarters, designated I and II below, adjacent to the intermediate 
time r.and then weighted accordingly. Thus,

where

OF POOt^ QliAiJ'slr 
All other factors beinp equal, tlierc can be no continuity in degradation values 
calculated by the limir or day. since there is no continuity in the data base from 
hour-to-hour or quarter-to-quarter. Data appearing in Tables A-1 and A-3 arc 
only averapes over these time periods: 2100-0300 hours, 0300-0100 hours, 
0000-1500 hours and lSOO-2100 hours; December to I'cbruary, March to iWay. 
June to August and September to November. Adapting the combined link plus 
weather model to intermediate times means that the degradations computed at 
two adjacent time periods must bo weighted. Linear weighting has been the 
choice, though nothing in the model precludes another selection, such as cubic 
or cos^ functions. 

If hourly resolution is desired, the expression for ^■/f^/^i/.C'CO) is given by 

E "A'^ = E ^f') = 1 (9.5-3)' 

where

In both cases, ^jotal '* evaluated at each of several elevation angles. By 
linearly interpolating between the Zypj^^^^iO) values the total degradation /(/) 
corresponding to the elevation profile is computed. Higlicr-order interpolation 
lecliniques can also be implemented. 



9.6 An Example: Ga(t(eo Communications Unit Design 

A telecommunications link prediction program was written for the Galileo 
Project utilizing the results described in this chapter. Given a confidence level, 
the weather model parameters applicable to the date of interest, a standard 
deviation for the link and the ground station elevation profile, a computer search 
algoritlim computes the total weatlier plus link degradation as a function of 
elevation angle. Since elevation angle is related to time by spacecraft trajectory, 
degradation is therefore related to time. However, the weather statistics arc

conffdenco for 6° - o ■ go°, Goldstono, Juno -August quarter, including radiometer 

available only for day quarters, year quaitors, or all year. The total degradation 
at a given liour on a given day must bo calculated from a weighted sum of com- 
puted degradations on two adjacent day quarters and year quarters, A perfor- 
mance prediction at the given confidence level is obtained by subtracting the 
total weather plus link degradation from weather-free estimates of P-pIN^, 
ground carrier SNR, symbol telemetry, or other link obsorvables, 

Galileo had been usi.ig an ad hoc procedure wherein adverse link performance 
predictions were computed by subtracting a degradation corresponding to 90% 
yearly weather and 2-sigma link uncertainty from weather-free expected value 
link performance predictions. Accounting for link tolerances and weather 
effects in this manner resulted in optimistic estimates of the mean link perfor- 
mance and unnecessarily conservative estimates of the adverse link performance. 
Moreover, little flexibility was available for choice of confidenca levels or time- 
varying weather statistics, As it turns out, the margin between tlie previous and 
current refined link performance predictions is significant. In the exumple 
developed below, the difference between the two measures of adverse link per- 
formance ranges from 0.6 dB al Goldstonc to 1.8 dB at Madrid,

9.7 The Galileo Link Prediction Algorithm 

Tlte Galileo Hiik prediction program calculates tlio total link and weather 
degradation Z{0{t)) vs time. To run it, the user specifies the Deep Space Station 
(DSS), day of year, and desired confidence levels. He must also decide whether 
to use day quarters (Table A-1) and/or yearly quarters (Table A-2) data. 

After the user specifics which data to use, the program selects the appropriate 
weather parameter values. If year quarterly data is desired. Tables 9-1 and 9-2 
yield the model parameters. With the chosen confidence levels at hand the pro-

is evaluated at several clevntioii angles ranpini; frnm d to 00 dep, for each of two 
adjacent ciiiarters and tlicn weipliied. Siil'licient values of Z(0) arc nmv computed 
In alUnv a snu till curve presentation of results. 

If the confidence level specified is tlie mean of /{O), the propram computes 
l'[/.(0)) directly from ('J .441. A similar alporitlun is followed when Z{0) is cal- 
culated for day quarters, only it is evaluated at several elevation anjiles at two 
adjacent day quarters and two adjacent year quarters. 

A note of caution is advised. Daily variations, while useful, suffer two disad- 
vantapes. Six-hour periods are probably too sliorl to averapo statistical incon- 
sistencies. Also the basic data are derived from cloud cover, hence are pessi- 
mistic. Table A-2 averages tiie dally statistics given in Table A-1 and is therefore 
more reliable. Choosing yearly quarter data (Table A-2) has the added advantage 
that model [laranieters have incorporated radiometer-measured data for a more 
accurate evaluation of weather effects, For the time being these results are 
available only at iJoidstone, 

Once /(/), the total linlv plus weather degradation, lias been computed for a 
given liour and day at the desired confidence level, the Galileo Link Prediction 
Program subtracts it from the weather-l'ree estimate oi PylNg. Tiie resulting 
jiroiile is the link periorniance al llie desired confidence level. 

The (jallico project specifies the link design value to be tlic expected value 
(approximately the 50';,' confidence level) of the overall link performance and 
tlie link adverse value to be the ^W^ confidence level of the overall link perfor- 
mance The teleconwiiunicutions predictions for clear, dry and (2 sigma, W"c< 
weatlier) ajipear as profiles A and i). respectively, in Fig, O-'). wirile the expected 
value and <)0'.'r confidence level of the link (including weather) are plotted as 
curves B and C\ respectively. 

Figure ')-10 show,*; llie same conditions, except for curve C, whicti was com- 
puted for 03';;. confidence. To summarize both figures, profile A is the sum of 
the (weather-free) link parameter design values; profile B adds the expected 
value wcatlicr loss; profile C is the 00 or ^5% confidence level, respectively; 
profile D is for -2 sigma link deviation plus 00';^' (yearly) weather loss (Tabic 
A-.l) relative to clear, diy, or curve A. 

Values used in the link-plus-weather model were taken from Tables 0-] and 
0-2. Goldstone incorporated a combination of the most pessimistic radiometer- 
measured data and cloud cover data while Canberra and Madrid used attenua- 
tion data only. Since the day for this pass is August 14, /f(0) was first com- 
puted for the June-August and September-November quarters over the specified 
elevation angles. Tiic weather-free link performance standard deviation is

0,87 dB, Usinp a wciglued average corresponding to tlie date, ^totaiX^^O) 
was derived from (').5-l). The total degradation Z(f) corresponding to tlie 
elevation profile was computed by linear interpolation of the ^roTAiS^^^^) 
values at each angle of 0. Tiiese steps were repeated for the mean, 90% and 95^o 
conildenco levels at each of the three DSS stations. Defining profiles B and C 
followed subtraction of the quarterly weiglUed degradations Z{t) from 
profile A, 

Profile I) Is the conventional way that Galileo specified adverse link condi- 
tions. It is computed by subtracting from profile A tlie sum of a 909o yearly 
v.'Cather contribution (Table A-3) and a tolerance contribution equivalent to a 
9^.12'/i> (two sigma) confidence level. The resulting difference between C and D 
at DSS 43 (Fig. 9-9) is attributed to inherent conservatism of the previous 
estimates of adverse link performance. Specifically, it is a consequence of the 
following: 

(1) O.l dB more degradation tn C due to the incorporation of quarterly 
rather than yearly data. 

(2) l.Q dB less degradation in C attributed to the difference between the 
90% degradation predicted by the link-plus-weather model and the degra- 
dation arising from adding tlic individual 90% degradations of the link 
and weather. 

(3) 0,6 dB less degradation in C due to the difference between a 90% (1.28 
sigma) and a 99.7% (2 sigma) link performance level.

quire accurate prediction of telecommunications link capability. Link capability 
determines spacecraft command message error rate, science data telemetry error 
rate, and radiometric angle, velocity, and position errors during a mission. To 
establish link performance capability, tlie analyst commonly translates these 
error rates into corresponding signal-to-noise ratios or received cignal power 
levels. To validate predicted capability, the analyst compares actual (measured) 
signal-to-noise ratios or signal levels with previously predicted values for the 
same link configuration and time. 

Prediction of link capability begins in the earliest stages of spacecraft com- 
munications system design and spacecraft-ground system tradeoffs. The com- 
parison of actual and predicted data begins with the fn^t use of the radio links 
after launch and continues until the end of the mission. Computations for both 
prediction and comparison are repetitive in nature over mission durations that 
may exceed a decade, Link analysis software provides the needed accuracy, 
consistent computations, and outputs in standard formats. The software accesses 
link parameter data bases having traceable updates over the mission duration.

communications Perlormance Analysis System (TPAS) in tlie l*'80s. TPAS is a 
joint development between JPl. tli^ht projects and the DSN, responding to the 
needs of both orpani/alions. TPAS capabilities will include access to actual 
data via an electrical interface for leul-tinre comparison, as well as liirk predic- 
tion, data rate prolilhu;, and nonreal-Ihne comparison.

project is described in 1 101 ] Ihtoueji [10-4] , The functional and design require- 
meirts for the successor system, TPAS, aie given in |10-5J through lU)-H].(The 
initial version of the real-time comparison portion of TPAS is called "Voyager 
Teiecomnumicatlons Dn-line Processing Subsystem." oi VTOPS.) 



10.2 Prediction of Link Capability Using TPAP 

This section describes the prediction functions, data How, and outputs of 
TPAP as the program exists at the end of l')82, The version described jiroduces 
predictions lor Voyager mission operations ami for (Jalileo jircllighl spacecral't 
and mission desigir. The TPAP conrjiarison and profiling fimclions are inactive 
on Voyager. Section 10.4 describes comparison and profiling as they will be 
implemented in TPAS for post- 1 '584 missions. 

The TPaP user maj geirerate any of tlie following predictions. 

(1) Telcmelr' : downlink carrier arrd data channel, 

(1) Command: uplink carrier and data channel. 

(3) Turnaromrd ranging: npHnk carrier, downlink carrier, and data channel. 

t4) Trajectory: range, angles, and derived <)uantities,

Mini-TPAP serves the special needs of early spacecraft and mission design. It 
facilitates input of trajectory data via card images and the rapid buildup of 
data base elements, Its outputs arc design control tables, plots, and tabulations 
that loolt similar to TPAP outputs. Mini-TPAP accommodates fuw-of-a-kind runs 
for preliminary design and tradeoffs. TPAP is best for repetitive production runs

tions coiniHoii to TPAP and niini-TPAP are identical. 

In liie TPAS era, TPAS will provide capability and ease ol' operation similar 
to the present mini-TPAP. 



10,4 Prediction, Profiling, and Comparison With TPAS 

TPAS provides project and DSN telecom analysts Involved witli tJalileo and 
siihseiiiient projects the capability to predict, inotlle, and compare the port'orni- 
anco ol' spacecrat't-tO'DJiN telecommunications links. TPAS prediction capa- 
bilities are tinictionally similar to TPAl' capabilities (Section 10.2). with similar 
outputs. Protilinn is the calculation of the maximum telemetry data rate that 
can be supported as a iunction of time, based on a planned Eequence of link 
confii^urations, on a stated dcyrce of link conservatism, and on the imderlyinp 
predictions. Cotnpaiison is the caiculation ol' the difference between a measured 
(actual) link ijuantity and its predicted value at a plven lime, the result being a 
residual, and the calculation oi' statistics of the residuals. 

TPAS-profilc functional roquirements oripinaie from the Vlkinp Orhiler 
TPAP Playback Opportunities Pmfile (TPBOP) projjram. TPAS-compare func- 
tional teiiuirements oripinate from the Mariner l')71 TPAP-compare program 
and the Voyayor Teleconi On-line Processing System (VTOPS). This section 
Includes typical outputs (rom Vikinp TPBOP and Voyager TOPS that sliow 
expected TPAS capability. TPAS-prolile and TPAS-compare will bo available in 
1084. 

f-'ipure 10-5 Is a functional How diagram lor TPAS. The Deep Space Network 
and the JPl. llight projects jointly support tire implementation and operation of 
TPAS. TPAS software resides in the DSN Network Operations Control Center 
(NOCC) Support Controller (NSC) computer. In the JPl. Information Processing 
Center (IPC) Uuivac 1 100 computer, and in a microprocessor called Automated 
Office Data Center (AODC). TPAS iietforms prediction, nroniing, o(T-line 
comparison and on-line comparison functions. 

The DSN uses the TPAS-prodlct element called NSC-Tl'AP to make its pre- 
dictions for lonp-ranpe planning and for each individual station tracking pass. 
Flight projects use the TPAS element called UllOO-TPAP for prediction and 
profiling of available telemetry data tales, and for oiT-tine comparison of space- 
craft and station data accumulated in a file against the predictions lor the same 
pass. On-line comparison for lliglit projects takes place in the TPAS clement, 
containing both hardware and software, called the Telecommunications On-line 
Processing System (TOPS). TOPS contains link verification (LINVKR) software

that operates In a particular AODC confieuratlon called the Telecommunica- 
tions On-line Ctviiputcr Subsystem (IOCS). On-line comparison requires a 
direct electrical connection with tlM: project computer supplying the data tor 
comparison in real-time. 

TPAS will incorporate a data-base system, residing in the IPC 1 100, with tlic 
program having a shared link model dictionary interacting with separate link 
deslpn data bases for each project. All data bases will have a common struc- 
ture and access mctliod. The link model dictionary contains information doscrib- 
inp data entries, processing, and output formats. The link design control docu- 
ment for each project is from the Deep Space Network/Flight Project Interface 
Dcsipn Handbook (a JPL internal document). Hach time the Ul 100 TPAI' data 
base is updated, a subset is traiislerred to the NSC as part of NSC-TPAI'. 

10.4.1 Functional Description and Data Flow 

Referring to Fig. 10-5, which omits reference to tiie different computers 
Lontainitig TPAS elements, all of the inputs i'rom external syaiems go to the 
TPAP portion except for tiie on-line actual data. Tiic TPAP inputs include tra- 
jectory files, link allocation lllcs, and off-line actual data files. TPAJ' requires 
trajectory and link allocation data to generate a profile. Tlie link allocation data 
defines tlie Deep Space Statiuns scheduled lor tlie project, the handover time 
from one to tlie next, the spacecraft transmitter power mode, the on/ol"f status 
of the spacecraft ranging channel, and other information required to define link 
configuration completely. TPAP rciiuiros off-line telecom data, and LINVUR 
requires on-line telecom data to perform a comparison. The telecom data is the 
actual sp.icecraft telemetry and the station performance and status monitor data 
received when the spacecraft is being tracked by the station during mission 
operations. 

The internal TPAS interfaces include the trajectory save file, tlic prediction 
save file, and the actual save file, TPAP creates a trajectory save file from the 
trajectory input, and this trajectory save file is used for subsequent predictions 
over that time interval. TPAP-predict creates a prediction save file for each of a 
series of standard configurations, and these prediction save files are used for tlie 
generation of subsequent profiles. Either TPAP-compare or LINVER can create 
an actual save file; it contains the link data accumulated during the comparison, 
the resulting residuals (a residual is equal to the actual value minus the predicted 
value of a link parameter), the residual statistics, and "alarm" messages flagging 
occurrences of the configuration not meeting its standard or tlie performance 
exceeding its limit. 

Both UllOO-TPAP and LINVER produce outputs for use by the project 
telecom analyst, and NSC-TPAI' produces predictions for operations controllers 
and analysts. 



503 



For the project, UUOO TPAP creates print/plot files that LINVRR accesses 
to generate DCTs, tabulatlous, and plots on the TOCvS line printer, digital 
plotter, or cathode ray tube display. The same outputs maybe produced through 
Ul 100 devices. TPAP-profilo produces a telemetry data rate profile as an Ul 100 
file. This file contains a header with input identification and link configuration 
data for profile verification. It also contains data files having spacecraft times 
and the maximum teloniotry data rate achievable during each interval. TPAP- 
compare and l.INVER produce printed tabulations and plots displaying the 
predicted, actual, and residual values of selected link parameters. The program 
also generates histograms to show the statistical distribution of residuals of 
selected lin!; parameters over a .specified time span. LINVER will enable the 
implementation of link alarms. Ihe standards and limits triggering the alarms 
come from tlie prediction save lilc. Link parameters in alarm appear on the 
TOCS cathode ray tube display and go into the actual save file. 

NSC-TPAP produces a prediction data file for cacli pass; the file contains 
quantities to be transmitted to the Deep Space Stations, used by other soft- 
ware in the NSC, or provided to DSN cattiode ray tube displays. 

10.4.2 Profile Outputs 

TPAP-profile will produce a downlink events and telemetry signal-to-noise 
ratio plot similar to I-ig. iO-6. Key station and spacecraft configuration events 
from the link allocation file appear at the top as a function of time. The signal- 
to-noise ratio that results from the standard predictions and tliese configura- 
tions appear on the plot. (Figure 10-6, for Viking Orbiter, comes from TPBOP.) 
TPAP-profile also will produce a printed profile, corresponding to the data rate 
profile. Table 10-5 is an example; it was produced by Viking TPBOP. The 
TPAS printed profile will display events in both spacecraft and station time, 
using one-way light-time from the prediction save file. It will list events from 
the link allocation file and their times. Not all such events may cause a data rate 
change, Available data rates may differ for different types of downlink data, 
according to project criteria. 

10.4.3 Compare Output Plot Formats 

TPAS-compare plot formats will show the variation of one or several link 
parameters or their residuals as a function of time. This section includes some 
figures as examples of plot formats. Those formats, which were useful on pre- 
TPAS projects, will be the basis for tlie TPAS formats. 

Figure 10-7, from Voyager TOPS, is tlie fundamental plot for on-line link 
assessment. This particular plot shows tlie values of the residuals of the X-band 
received carrier power as a function of time. A similar format is available for the 
uplink or the downlink received carrier power and for tlie telemetry symbol 
signal-to-nolse ratio. Formats are also available that show residuals of two or

Figure 10-8, from TPAP-compare for Mariner 1971, is for long-term trend 
analysis. The plot has the predicted value and the actual data on a common time 
axis, in this case spanning one month. A similar format, but with the residual as 
a sing.'3 curve rather than the predicted and actual as two curves, appears in 
Fig. 10-9. Figure 10-9, from the Viking TPRESD manual non-real-time compare 
program, also displays the mean and tlie standard deviation of tlie parameter 
over the plotted interval. Figure 10-10, from TPAP-compare for Mariner 1971, is 
a histogram for the residual of a link parameter over an interval. 

10.5 Real-Time Comparison for Voyager Using TOPS 

By late 1981, Voyager telecom analysts began making real-time link compari- 
sons using the Voyager telecommunications on-line processing system (VTOPS).

piofillns occuts, for most projects, a week to a niontli belote aaiuisltUm of data. 
On-line link comparison takes place wltliin a minute of data acquisition, while 
off-line con^paiison lor anomaly resolution and trend analysis is largely complete 
witiiin a montli after data acquisition. Each of tlio 14 project telecom activities 
involves the vise of one or more of the TI'AS capabilities. Table lOo sliows (he 
activities, the portion of TPAS involved, and u summary of the important 
attritnites of each activity. 

At a given time on the project side, three or four people are actively using or 
su]iportin[> TI'AS. This number assumes a level ot fllghr support similar to 1^77, 
when JPL mission opotations teams supported two projects and telecom analysts 
were working on the preproject deilnilion or prelaunch development of other

In terms of the people usinti; or supporting TPAS, most are involved with llight 
operations. In units of work months per month during mission operations, 
TPAS-prcdict and TPAS-prollle require about 0.5, TPAS on-line compaie about 
1.3, TPAS-preUict and TPAS-proiile about 0.5. TPAS off-lino compare about 
to, and software and TOCS hardware niaintenance about 0.4, TPAS pi edict for 
proptoject and prelaunch use is at the level of 0..*l work month pet month. 

TJie NSC'-TPAl' functions appear in the lower left quarter of f-ig. 10-12. 1'or 
the DSN, the initial plan is to operate NSC-TPAP in ihe batch mode. The DSN 
functions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, NSt' TPAP requires the equivalent 
of 2 people to maintain the data base (using the IMIOD), prepare input data 
llles for the propram, run llie predictions, and verily the outputs for cotrectncss. 
The input I'iles include ephetneris and spacecraft trajectory data and sequence of 
event data lor each tracking pass. In the late l')BOs, the IXSN plans to include 
NSC-TPAP in an end-to-ond system that supports all planning lunctions for tire 
tracking passes, including scheduling, sequence of events generation, ephemerls 
and Iiajecioiy generation, telecommunications link prediction, and generation 
of stajidards for station equipment settings ami limits for equipment operating 
paratneters. Tlie statYing level for NSC-TPAP Itself in that era would reduce to 
the equivalent of about one-half person, mainly Ibr data base maintenance and 
output verification.

11.1 Introduction 



Sucrt -sful radio comnumioation between sjiacecraft and earth stations 
depends upon the use of appropriate radio frequencies and upon having suffi> 
dent freedom from interference. Radio frequencies for deep-space researcli may 
lie chosen from bands tliat are allocated for that piirpose. The choice of particu- 
■'ar frequencies within tJiose bands is guided mostly by the need to avoid inter- 
crcnce between deep-space missions. Interference may also result from terres- 
trial sources making transmissions not related to space researcli. 

In tliis chapter we discuss the bands available for deep-space communications, 
and the choice of particular mission frequencies. The more general susceptibility 
of deep-space eartli stations to various kinds of interference is then presented. 
An associated topic is the development of protection criteria that specify maxi- 
mum allowable levels of interference. 

Next, the prediction of interference from near-earth satellites is described, 
witli particular emphasis on the problems and uncertainties of such predictions. 
The chapter concludes with a brief description of otlier activities aimed at the 
prevention or avoidance of interference to deep-space radio communications. 



11.2 International Allocation of Radio-Frequency 
Bands 

Use of the radio rroqiiency spectrum is repiilated by international treaty. Tlie 
International Teieconimiinications Union (ITU), a special agency of the United 
Nations, is the body rcsponsii>le lor determining the repulations (1 1-1]. Over 
150 nations are members of the ITU, which has its headquarters in Geneva, 
Switzerland. 

The radio regulatory action of the ITU is based on work conducted by its 
International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR)- /.> a result of the formal 
process of adopting technical papers presented at international nieolinys, the 
CCIR quadrennially publislies a set of official reports and recommendations. 
These deal with technical issues concerning the use and regulation of the radio 
frequency spectrum by all radio services. 



CCIR includes II study groups that treat tlie various radio services. Study 
Group 2 is concerned with space research and radio astronomy. The technical 
basis for the allocation and use of bands lor deep-space research is a part of the 
work of CCIR Study Group 2. Reports and recommendations concerning tecii- 
nical requirements, preferred frequencies, band sharing, and interference protec- 
tion criteria relating to deep-space communications may be Ibund in [1 1-2] . 



1 1 .3 Bands Allocated to Deep-Space Research 

Allocation of radio frequency bands is defined in terms of radio services. 
One of tlicse services is space research. Deep-space communications must take 
place in bands allocated for space research. In recognition of the special charac- 
teristics of deep-space conmnmications, e.g., very weak received signals and very 
high-power earth stations, all or part of some space research bands have been 
restricted to deep space only. In all cases, the bands allocated to deep-space 
research are shared bands. Tills means that the bands are also used by other 
specified services. The characteristics of these otiier services have been shown to 
be generally compatible with deep-space links from the standpoint of interfer- 
ence. Continuing analysis of potential interference in connection with increased 
usage of tlie shared bands is necessary for the protection of deep-space commun- 
ications. Casc-by-case analysis rind resolution of actual interference problems is 
also required. 

The ban'ls that may be used for aad that are restricted to deep-space com- 
munications in the space research seivice are listed in Table 1 1-1. Excerpts of 
tlie more complete language contained in the international Radio Regulations 
can be found in Appendix A.

For spacecraft navipalion and some types of scientific measurement it is 
necessary tliat uplinit (earlli-to space) anil downlink (space-to-earth) transmis- 
sions be pliase colicrent. Tliis means tliat tlie uplink frequency and phase re- 
ceived by the spacecraft transponder must be translated by a fixed ratio and 
used to control the downlink frequency and phase from the spacecral't. The 
requirement for colierence applies between the uplink and downlink frequen- 
cies of a band pair. The requirement can also apply to simultaneous transmis- 
sions in more than one band pair. 

Of tlio four band pairs listed in Table 1 l-I, channel plans have been devel- 
oped for the first two [11-3]'. Table 11-2 shows the associated frequency 
ratios. 

In the list of channels. Table 1 1-3, Column 3, we see that there arc 27 chan- 
nel center frequencies within the 2290-2300-MII/ downlink band, Channel 
frequencies in the other bands are a necessary result of the frequency ratios. 
A particular channel number for example, channel 17 specifies frequencies 
in all four bands. 

Because of tlie spacing between allocations and the frequency ratios embodied 
in the channel plans, some channels in eacli band may not be usable from the 
standpoint of coherence. When complete coherence between tlie two uplink and 
two downlink bands is required, the frequencies selected can only be chosen 
from cliannols S-27,

11.6.3 Intorferenco Protection Ratio 

I'lie aeoeptable ratio of interlerence to sit'.nal power is called tlie interteretieo 
protection ratio. Tl'O re^iiiired ratio is considered to he -.^0 dH duriim critical 
mission phases and -IS dB at other times. Viie ratio expresses (he iua\inunii 
interlerence power with respect to the power of tiie desired sii',nal. The powers 
in the ratio are those of the spectral components beinn considered for a partic- 
ular interference mode, 

A -IS dll ratio will produce a usually neplipible etTecl on carrier iracking 
perforiuance [1 1-5, ". r-ti| , a OA dB de(\radallon of telenietrv performance, and 
a 1.0 dB dejiradation of conuuartd performance, assumlntl that bo(h tire telem- 
etry and command are operalinn at a synrbol error rate of 10 ^. Tlie -."'O dR

Tliese protection ratios niay seem particularly conservative. Tiie> aiejuslttled 
by the fad that the freiiuency selection study is usually performed ii\ a very 
early phase of a mission when uncertainties exist about man\' parameters that

can affect the interference situation. Additionally, it is a goal of diannel selec- 
tion to provide the safest environment so tliat mission planners will have maxi- 
mum flexibility. 

The maximum acceptable uplink one-v/ay interference is called the uplink 
one-way tlueshold. It is considered to be equal to tlie spacecraft receiver sensi- 
tivity. Tills sensitivity is usually in the range from -155 dBm to -165 dBm. 

11.6.4 Interference Analysis 

There are four steps in the interference analysis and channel selection process; 

( 1 ) Determine power levels of tlie interference and the desired signal 

(2) Determine the likely modes of interference, e.g., cartier-to-carrier inter- 
ference, Carrie r-to-data interference, etc. 

(3) Detennine the time and duration of potential interference 

(4) Select one or more channels to avoid potential interference during 
critical mission events and to minimize potential interference at other 
times 

To acliieve tliese steps, it is necssary to havff tlie following infornsation for 
all the missions involved; 

(1) Characteristics of the telecommunication system 

(2) Expected modes of operation as a function of time 

(3) Dates of important mission events 

(4) Orbital elements that specify tlie mission trajectory 

A complete list and description of Uie above items are provided in Appendix B. 

A computer program has been developed to assist in tlie calculations needed 
for inteiference analysis. This program examines two missions at a time. It 
accepts as its input a set of orbital elements that completely specify the trajec- 
tories of tlie missions being examined. Based on these orbital elements, it com- 
putes for botli missions the spacecraft-to-earth range, the doppler rate, and the 
angular separation between tlie two spacecraft. From these data and an assumed 
fixed e.i.r.p., it then computes the ratio of tlie total received signal power to the 
total received interference power (TSIR)^, and also the uplink interference 
power level as received by the spacecraft. The calculations are made for selected

intervals of time during tlic period of operation that is common for a particular 
pair of missions, 

11.6.4.1 Downlinli interference analysis. Tiie earth-station receiving antenna is 
assumed to be pointing at the desired spacecraft and to be receiving data from it 
(Fig. 1 1-1). The signal from the other spacecraft is treated as potential interfer- 
ence. The downlink TSIR is calculated by the computer program for both 
missions, assuming an equal e.i.r.p. The equations for tiie computation are; 

TSIR, = G^^^ - G(0) + 20 logj„ (RJR^) 

where Gj^jf^i^ is the gain of the receiving antenna in dBi, R is the spacecraft-to- 
earth range, G(d) is the gain of the receiving antenna in the direction of 0, and 
the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two missions, with 1 being arbitrarily assigned 
to one mission and 2 to the other. The off-axis antenna gain, G(d), is modeled 
by the following expressions: 

GiO)- G^^^-(G,,^^-32)-0 dB forO°<0<r, 
= 32 - 25 log,„ (0) dB forr^0<48° 

=■ -10 dB for48''<0. 



The next step is to determine the potential modes of interference based on 
tlie spectra of the desired signal and the interference. 

The interference modes can be determined by finding out which part of the 
unwanted signal can spectrally interfere with which part of the wanted signal, 
i.e., carrier-to-carrier interference, data-to-carrier interference, etc. An unwanted 
signal can spectrally interfere with a wanted signal if tliey are close in frequency. 
Since Doppler-shift can move the two spectra closer to or farther apart from 
each other, it may be necessary to consider tlie Doppler effects in determining 
the modes of interference, particularly when the Doppler rate is significant. 

The computer program calculates the total interference power. The analyst 
must consider the amount of interference power that applies to a particular 
interference mode. The effective interference power of an in-band CW inter- 
ference is simply equal to tlie power of the interference. The effective interfer- 
ence power of an interference having a dense spectrum is equal to the power of 
tite interference reduced by a factor equal to tl:e bandwidth conversion factor.

sions assumes an isotropic receiving antenna. It is therefore necessary to increase 
the interference power by an amount equal to tlie receiving antenna pair, before 
it can be compared to the iipiinii one-way threshold to determine tlw amount of 
potential interference, 

11.6.5 Additional Selection Considerations 

Deep-space missions usually have periods of intense activity separated by 
lonper periods of relatively low activity. Interterence during the quiet periods 
will often be acceptable, The potential interlerence may be strong and virtually 
destroy successful telccomnmnications, or it may only cause a sliglit degradation 
of performance. The severity of interference therefore affects the choice of 
channel. 

Often, more than one frequency band is used on a mission. The potential 
interference is usually different for different frequency bands. It may be neces- 
sary to examine the potential interference for all frequency bands involved 
before a selection can be made. Since these frequencies are related to each other 
by a fi.\ed translation ratio, the resulting channels may he optimal in one band, 
Intt not the other. 



11.6.6 Channel Availability 

U has been possible, so far, to make channel selections sucli that significant 
interference between deep-space missions docs not occur, Tliis is because of the 
narrow boamwidth of tlie DSN earth-station antennas and the characteristics 
of mission trajectories. Common usage of a single channel is often possible. As 
other countries and agencies begin to make use of deep-.'ipace bands, tliore may 
lie increasing difficulty in finding channels free of interference for the total dura- 
tion of cich mission. It will then be necessary to accept some interference 
during noncritical times.

11.7 Frequency Assignment 

r'ollowing the recommendation of channels for a new U.S. mission, formal 
application for frequency assignment is made by the JPL Fiequency Manager. 

In tiie United States, use of tlie radio frequency spectrum is managed tiy two 
separate agencies. Tlie Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manages 
usage for all non-Federal civil purposes, including those of state and local govern- 
ments. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) of the Department of Commerce manages spectrum usage by the Federal 
Government [1 1-7] . NASA deep-space missions are considered Federal users. 

In order to assure electromagnetic compatibility with existing and planned 
telecommunications systems, NTIA requires a four-stage review of proposed new 
systems. The various stages are related to the cycle of project development and 
procurement. These activities may not begin witliout favorable action at tlie 
corresponding part of the review process. In practice, JPL prepares two submis- 
sions for review. NASA completes the jieoded interaction witli NTIA, 

For the first submission, the JPL Frequency Manager prepares a system review 
package. The package includes a brief mission description, technical character- 
istics of the planned comnumication links and equipment, and the results of 
the channel selection study. Tlie review package is sent to NASA and then on 
to the Spectrum Plaiming Subcommittee (SPS) of NTIA. 



Assuming favorable review, SPS will recommend tliat NTIA grant spectrum 
support and that the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS) of NTIA act 
favorably on an application for assignment wlien such is received. Spectrum 
support means tliat NTIA agrees with the proposed usage of the requested band 
for the purposes of the new mission, and will eventually act to assign specific 
frequencies. 

Tlie initial approval by SPS will include a recommendation tliat Advance 
Publication Information on Planned Satellite Systems be sent to tlie Interna- 
tional Frequency Registration Board (IFRB), a part of the ITU in Geneva. A 
draft of tills Advance Publication Information document is included in tlie 
first system review package. Upon receipt of the approved document by tlie 
IFRB, it is translated into the three working languages (Frcncli, English, and 
Spanish) and mailed to member countries. 

The purpose of tlie Advance Publication Information on Planned Satellite 
Systems is to inform these countries of the proposed frequency assignment, and 
to invite comments. The comment period of ninety days allows any country to 
initiate discussions of compatibility. 



529 



OF POOR Qt^ALJ-uY 

For the second submission by JPL, tiic Frequency Manager will prepare a 
new review package, including up-to-date ledinical data, response to questions 
raised by SPS, and a draft formal Notification of Frequency Assignment. This 
new pacliagc is sent to NASA and on to SPS. 

VVitli favorable review, SPS will recommend that NASA apply for a frequency 
assignment, tliat FAS grant the requested assignment, and that a Notification of 
Frequency Assignment be sent to IFRB. 

Ultimately, the mission and frequencies are published in the Master Interna- 
tional Frequency Register. The Register is a large set of catalogs and supple- 
ments that Include several hundred tliousand frequency assignments by countries 
around the world. Inclusion of new assignments in the Register is the result of 
IFRB procedures aimed at ensuring compliance witlt applicable regulations and 
technical standards. To enjoy the protection offered by tiie regulations, a new 
station or system must be registered. 



11.8 Susceptibility to Ratio Frequency Interference 

In connection with channel selection. Section 11.6 of this chapter described 
the analysis of potential interference between missions. The ISR criteria used to 
identify tJie possibility of downlink interference are based upon tlie character- 
istics of tlie receiving systems employed at deep-space eartli stations. The study 
of tlieir interference susceptibility also applies to the more general problem of 
RFI from otiier terrestrial radio services. These problems arise because the bands 
used for deep space communication are shared witli otlier users. This shared use 
creates tlie potential for interference that must be analyzed and managed. 



The susceptibility of deep-space eartli stations and spacecraft to various 
lands of interference is the subject of continuing analysis and test. Mathematical 
models of receiver circuits and processes are developed. These models are then 
verified by laboratory testing in which the effects of various kinds of interfer- 
ence are measured. An overview of the development of susceptibility models 
can be found in [11-8]. 

The verified models may tlien be used to predict interference tliat could arise 
from known existing and potential sources. An additional use is to provide 
information to other agencies that may be concerned with or affected by the 
DSN. For example, under an agreement between NASA and the Department of 
Defense, JPL provides susceptibility data to the Electromagnetic Compatibility 
Analysis Center. That organization is Involved in frequency and interference 
management for the military services.

11.8.1 Interforonco Typos 

The spectral cliaraclcristic of a raJio sipiiat depends on (he kind of modula- 
tion, For assessment of potential interferenee it is convenient to consider three 
classes of spectra; C'W, noise-like, and pulse. CW (coiuinuous wave) interference 
is ciiaracteri/ed by a single spectral line such as an unmodulated carrier. Noise- 
like interference refers to complex spectra whose width is preater than the band- 
width of the victim receiver that is. spectra that affect the victim receiver in a 
manner similar to noise. Pulse Interference peneraily has a spectrum containing 
a mnnbor of relatively distinct spectral lines. Many systems liave spectral chai- 
acteristics that do not fall neatly within or^e of the three classes, A frequency- 
iioppinp pulse radar is an example. 

11.8.2 interference Effects 

Radio frequency interference (UFI) can affect deep-space communications 
in several different ways, dependinp upon the strenplh and nature of the inter- 
ference. Interference tliat falls wiOiin the tracking bandwidth of a phase-locked 
loop can induce phase jitter and dci^raded performance. Still stronger interfer- 
ence can cause the loop to drop lock and, in some cases, track the interfering 
signal. These effects may occur in one or more of the several functional loops 
typical of receivers used for deep-space communications: carrier tracking, sub- 
carrier demodulation, and symbol synchronization. 

Another class of interference is that where the interfering signal is outside 
the various loop bandwidlhs but is of sufficient strength to result in saturation 
of one or more receiver stages. The effect of saturation is to cause gain com- 
pression and corresponding nonlinearity in the amplification and detection of a 
desired signal to which tlie receiver is tuned. Nonlinearity also leads to the 
generation of harmonics, spurious signals, and intermodulation products that 
may cause interference. 

Several aspects of these interference effects have been studied and reported 
in [11-2] . [1 l-S] , [1 1-6] . and [1 1-9 through 1 1-12] , The following sections of 
this chapter present information taken from those reports. This is done to 
acquaint tiie reader with a general idea of tlie CW interference susceptibility of 
the Block IV receiving system used in the DSN. 

11.8.3 Susceptibility to Saturation 

CW signals of sufficient strengtii can saturate tJie MASER preamplifier or 
subsequent stages of the ea'-th-station receiver. The particular stage or stages 
that may be affected depend upon tlie frequency difference between the inter- 
fering signal and the frequency to which tire receiver is tuned. The amount of 
interference power that causes a particular degree of saturation depends upon 
the strength of the desired signal, since that signal determines tlie gain of several

receiver stapes via tlie automatic gain control loop, For tlic purpose of developing 
a curve of maximum allowable interference power, a tluesliold (weakest) level is 
assumed for the desired stpnal. 

Fii'ure 11-2 gives a curve that meets tlie criterion of not more than 1 dB of 
gain compression due to saturation. In a somewhat trbltrary manner, 1 dB of 
compression has come to be considered an acceptable value. 

11.8.4 Carrier Tracking Susceptibility to CW Interference 

The effect of CW interference on the carrier trackine function of a DSN 
Block IV roceivvr Ivjs been analyzed and modeled [11-6] . Fipure 11-3 illustrates 
tiic analytic relationship between tlie interlcrcnce-lo-signal ratio tljat results in 
carrier-loop drop lock as a lunction of the frequency dilTerencc between tlie 
desired carrier sipnal and tlie intcrferinp CW Eignal. Curves are piven lor three 
values of margins, i.e., tl'.e ratio of carrier power to noise power in tlie tracking- 
loop bandwidth. Figure 114 shows tracking-loop phaiic jitter as a function of 
interference to-sipnal ratio for several vnlues cf frequency offset. 

Combining these and similar analytli; relationships VL-ith laboratory tust data 
results in a curve of maximum allowable- CW Interlerence ratios and levels. An

11.8.5 Telemetry Susceptibility to CW Interference 

CW interference tliat falls in or near tlie telemetry predetection bandwidtli 
can result in degraded performance as expressed in terms of error rate. Perhaps 
less obvious is tlie degradation tiiat can be caused by odier CW RFI that is 
translated in frequency by the squarewave demodulation of the telemetry sub- 
carrier. Tiiis translation process can move the interfering signal into the telem- 
etry passband, often witli sufficient amplitude to result In degraded perfor- 
mance. This section presents data resulting from models that describe the 
degradation of coded and uncoded data streams as caused by in-band and 
translated CW RFI. Tlie performance described by the models has been verified 
by laboratory testing and found to be generally representative of actual inter- 
ference effects. Keep in mind tliat tlie information presented is for the Block IV 
receiving system and for CW interference. Other receiver or interference types 
are not included. 

The probability of symbol error as a function of tlie ratio of symbol energy 
to noise spectral density, witli ISR as a parameter, is shown in Fig. 11-6. The 
curves apply to the error probability for an uncoded data stream. The equivalent 
loss in symbol energy-fo-noise spectral density ratio as a function of ISR is 
anotlier way to express the effect of CW RFI and tliis is shown in Fig. 11-7. 

The effect of in-band CW RFI on the performance of a telemetry system 
using convolutional codes is difficult to analyze mathematically. Nevertheless,

1 1 .8.6 Interference Protectfon 

The degree of susceptibility of deep-space communication systems to various 
kinds of Interference determines the maximum allowable level of ii-vterference 
that can be tolerated witliout harm. Based upon acceptable degrees of perfor- 
mance degradation, interference protection criteria have been developed at JPL. 
These criteria are sliown in Tables 11-5 and 1 1-6, and have been adopted by tlie 
CCIR. Note that tliese criteria are single valued for each allocated band, as 
opposed to the susceptibility curves presented earlier. The purpose of tlie 
single value is to provide protection anywhere witliin each band, tiius giving the 
maximum freedom to assign frequencies to deep-space missions. 

A principal use of tiie protection criteria is in the calculation of potential 
interference from new systems tliat may sliare the band allocations. The proce- 
dure, use, and consequences of tliese calculations are described in the Radio 
Regulations [11-1].

tlie computation of an interference effect. The difficulty of accurate predictiori 
is described and tlie consequences of a worst case calculation are pointed out. 
It is infended that the reader gain an appreciation of tlie prediction problem, 
rather than the specific ability or information needed to make predictions. 

11.9.1 Satellite Interference 

Some earth-orbiting sateUites operate in or near deep-space band allocations. 
Because tliese satellites are relatively near tlie earth, Uiey possess a significant 
potential for interference witli tlie weaker signals from deep space. Since the 
satellites repeatedly and predictably come into view of deep-space earth stations, 
it is desirable and, in principle, possible to forecast tlie possibility of interference. 

11.9.2 Information Needed for Prediction 

In order to successfully predict tlie time and effect of satellite interference it 
is necessary to know; 

(1) The characteristics of the satellite-transmitted signal spectrum 

(2) The gain of the satellite antenna in the direction of the deep-space eartli 
station 

(3) The location and radial velocity of the satellite as a function of time 

540 



OF PQOii (,,;:;.„.rrv 

(4) The gain of the eardi-station antenna in t]ie direction of tlie satellite 

(5) Tlie susceptibility of tlie cartli-station receiving system to the Dopplcr- 
shifted interfering satellite signal 

It is also necessary to have similar Information about the spacecraft being 
tracked, since the effect of interference depends in part upon the strength and 
spectral characteristics of the desired signal. 

11.9.3 Prediction Models and Calculations 

To compute the time and effect of interference, matliematical models of 
susceptibility are employed. One approach is to model tlic effect of a CW signal 
and then to test each Interfering spectral line against the CW model. For exam- 
ple, the possibility of carrier-loop drop lock may be tested as follows. Drop lock 
is predicted if; 



I>Pf^ wlien AF<B 

ll- 20 log ^J >P^ when AF^B 



where 

/ is the power of an interfering spectral line, 

P^ is tlie power of the carrier being tracked. 

AF is tlie frequency difference between tlie spectral line and tlie carrier. 

B is the bandwidth of the carrier tracking loop. 

Given tlie proper models, similar computation can be used to predict telem- 
etry drop lock, and degradation of carrier tracking or telemetry performance as 
expressed by signal-to-noise ratio. 

The success of this metliod of prediction depends upon the accuracy of tlie 
models, tlie ability to accur tely compute the ainplltude and frequency of each 
of several signal components, and tlie validity of tlie assumption that tlie inter- 
fering signal may be characterized by a set of spectral lines. In practice, it is 
difficult to make accurate predictions because of uncertainties, particularly with 
regard to the spectral line amplitude and frequency.

11.9.4 Missed Detection and False Warning 



ORtGik^JA". r-i ,.. .■■J 
OF POOR QUALi'iY 



A desirable prediction is one that forecasts an event tliat later takes place, 
The objectives for interference prediction are to forecast interference that does 
occur, and to minimize forecasts of interference that does not occur. Interfer- 
ence that is tmpredlcted is called a missed detection, and predicted but unreal- 
ized interference is called a false warning. For the protection of deep-space 
commimication it is vitally important that missed detections do not orcur, at 
least during critical mission phases. False warnings are less serious, but can 
damage the credibility that allows effective interference management witli otht 
agencies and satellite operations. 



The probabilities of missed detection and false warning are not independent 
and are governed by the information and computation that lends to prediction. 
Figure 11-9 illustrates how amplitude and frequency uncertainties influence 
prediction Carrier drop lock is expected whenever the combination of AFmi 
ISR of an interfering line falls between tiie two curves. Assume that the calcu- 
lated AF and ISR for a spectral line yield the point shown, for a particular 
instant of time.

ORICIMAL Pi\^a m 
OF POOR QUiALITY, 

There is an uncertainty in tlie value of AF that results froin error in the 
calculation of satellite radial velocity and t);e corresponding Dopfler sh)fl and 
from imprecise knowledge of the satellite tiansmitted frequency, i'imilarly, the 
ISR is uncertain to a degree determined by arror in modeling the of '"-axis p Jn of 
llie earth-station antenna in the direction of the true satellite position' This 
error is a function of time because the dlffevences between the inodtled and true 
antenna gains are angle, and hence, time dependent. In addition, the iime 
dependent antenna gain of the satellite autenna in the direction of the earth 
station is imperfectly known. 

In the example of Fig. 1 1-9, one cornrr of the area of uncertainty sjrround- 
ing the calculated point falls within the drop lock region. If a missed cetection 
is to be avoided, a drop lock orediction must be issued. Necessarily f.ttendant 
to this prediction is a high pro» jbiUty that drop lock will not occur, as ndlctiod 
by the uncertainty area outside of tlio drop lock region. 

It will be seen that a worst case prediction of interference possibil ty can be 
made, accompanied by a high rate of fake warnings. Accurate prediction, within 
the usual meaning of accuracy, is difficult. The prediction of satelliti interfer- 
ence possibility is nevertlieless useful, for it provides the opportunity of correc- 
tive or evasive action. 

Several courses of action are available. The timing of some spacecraft events 
may be adjusted to avoid periods of possible interference. Spacecraft or satelHte 
telemetry or trackmg modes can sometimes be changed to alter spectral rela- 
tionships in a way to reduce interference. To protect critical mission phases, it 
may be possible to negotiate satellite silence during tliose times. This has been 
done successfully, even with satellites of other nations. 



11.10 RFI Prevention and Avoidance 

In foregoing sections of this chapter we have discussed a number of regula- 
tory, cooperative, and technical procedures, metlrods, and techniques for manag- 
ing and protecting the radio frequencies used for deep-space communication. 
There are several other JPL activities that are aimed at protecting tlie DSN. fligiit 
projects, and radio science activities from harmful radio interference. These 
activities include; 

(1) Monitoring the radio frequency environment in the Goldstone area by 
means of automatic spectrum analysis that examines the deep-space 
bands and reports signals that exceed a threshold. Although the moni- 
toring equipment is much less sensitive than the D5N eartli stations witlr 
their large antennas and .naser amplifiers, tlie detection of strong inter- 
fering signals provides information that is useful in managing the electro- 
magnetic environment. Signals from nearby fixed, mobile, and airborne 



543 



OF POOU <■;.- ' ■ 

sources, as we'l as those from earth-orbiting satellites, can be detected by 
the monitor. 

(2) Participation in organizations and procedures lor control of the radio 
emissions Ir tlie Goldstone area. Originally a quiet jite for reception of 
weak slgna's, Goldstone Is now surrounded by extersive radio activity, 
some of w lich may contaminate the signals from diep space. To control 
the cnvirc mient for tlie benefit of all, there is a cocrdinytion proup that 
meets repaiarly to discuss RFI problems and seek operational or tech- 
nical solii ;ions to them. 

(3) Devclopnent of techniques and equipment for improved immunity to 
interfere ice. Deep-space communication links, and the DSN earth sta- 
tions in particular, have been desipned to give maximum performance 
in a qu.et radio frequency environment. In some instances the design 
characttristics increase the susceptibility to interference. For example, 
tlie ma«er bandwidtli is, from an RFI viewpoint, too wide. One approach 
to min niize tlie effect of RFI is to employ filters between the antenna 
and mtser. These filters could have a fixed bandpass just wide enough to 
accept a single mission spectrum, or could be tunable to reject particular 
interference. In either case, the filters must be cryogenically cooled to a 
few kelvins if system performance is to be maintained. Another possi- 
bility for improved immunity to RFI is the use of spread spectrum mod- 
ulation of the downlink spacecraft signal. This creates a bandwidth 
mismatch between the desired and interfering signals, to the advantage 
of the desired signal. 

The complete scope of acquisition, management, and protection of frequen- 
cies for deep-space research is thus seen to be unexpectedly broad and an essen- 
tial element of mission success.

Determination of Potential Downlink interference 
1. Introduction 

This appendix illustrates the steps necessary to determine if potential inter- 
ference exists between two deep space downlinks. The two spacecraft examined 
arc designated as 1 and 2 and spacecraft 1 is arbitrarily chosen as the wanted 
spacecraf "'d the otlier as the source of interference. Thus, tiiis appendix 
examinOi y interference to spacecraft 1 from spacecraft 2. The interfer- 
ence Irom spacecraft 1 to spacecraft 2 can be obtained by following the same 
procedures.

3. Intcirference Modes 



OK C'^Ou (,u.^L.VV 



To determine the interference modes, it is necessary to examine tlie spectra 
of the signal and the interference. A sketch of the spectra of these two signals 
is shown in Figure C- 1 . 

From the sketch, it can be seen tliat tliere are two interference modes: 
carrier-to-carrier and data-to-data. The potential interference for both modes is 
discussed in the following sections. 



4. Carrier-to-Carrier Interference 

To determine if potential interference exists for this mode, it is necessary to 
calculate the power of tlie wanted signal and the power of the unwanted signal 
in the carrier channel. The power of tiie wanted signal in the carrier channel is 
simply the carrier power of spacecraft I . The unwanted power is the carrier 
power of spacecraft 2. The wanted and unwanted power can be calculated as 
follows:

= 19.8-27.7-0 = -7.9 dB 

which exceeds die -15 dB protection ratio by about 7 dB. Potential interference 
to the carrier of spacecraft 1 thus exists, 

5. Data-To-Data Interference 

To determine if tliis mode of interference exists, it is necessary to calculate 
the data power of spacecraft 1 and spacecraft 2. These power levels can be calcu- 
lated as follows; 



Spacecraft 1 downlink e.i.r.p. 
Modulation loss (20 log (sin (80°))) 

Wanted data power level 



Spacecraft 2 downiinlt c.i.r p. 
Modulation loss (20 log (sin (40°))) 

Unwanted data power level 

Since the unwanted signal has a dense spectrum, it is necessary to adjust 
tlie unwanted signal power according to the bandwidtJi conversion factor. Tne 
bandwidtli conversion factor, Bp-, is defined as follows: 



35.0 dBW 


-0.' dB 


34.9 dBW 


30.0 dBW 


-3.8 dB 


26.2 dBW 




where B^^ is the bandwidth of the wanted signal and Bf is the bandwidth of the 
interference. Since the bandwidth of a data cha.nnel is proportional to the data 
rate, the bandwidth conversion factor can thus be calculated from the following 
equation.

which exceeds tlie -15 dB protection ratio. Potential interference lo the space- 
craft 1 telemetry tlius exists. 



6. Conclusion 

The foregoing analysis of a simple hypothetical case serves as an illustration 
of the techniques used for interference analysis. Real spacecraft often employ 
more Uian one subcarrier channel on the downlink and tlieir spectra are thus 
more complicated. As a result, interference analysis of an actual system may be 
mere involved.

interfaces 

James C. Springett and Peter W. Kinman 



12.1 Introduction 

There are two important telecommunications system interfaces: (1) between 
tlie spacecraft and the space shuttle, and (2) between the spacecraft and the 
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), Since the shuttle and 
TDRSS are new, an introductory discussion of their basic telecommunication 
interface properties is provided. However, this chapter is far from a compreiien- 
sive treatment of the subject. For a more complete description of shuttle and 
TDRSS telecommunications, the reader should consult [12-1], [12-2], and 
[12-3], 



12.2 Space Shuttle Telecommunications Interfaces 

Among the various missions that can be carried out by the shuttle orbiter, 
the primary function is the use of the shuttle as a launch vehicle for satellites to 
be placed into earth orbit and for spacecraft to be sent into decpspaco. A user

of the shuttle orbiter system for launch purposes wUl liave need to communi- 
cate with tlie orbiter and witli tlie ground. To provide sucli communications, 
tlie orbiter contains a versatile set of payload-oriented avionic hardware and 
furnishes a variety of communication linlis. A user that requires communication 
links may make use of the sliuttle communication systems in \. ^her a standard 
or nonstandard manner. Standard accommodations will meet the majority of 
user requirements with maximum flexibility and reliability, and with minimum 
concern and cost. Nonstandard capabilities, however, are also provided so that 
special/unique user needs may be met. In the nonstandard situation, the user 
bears a much greater responsibility for the design, Implementation, and opera- 
tion of the communication Hnk. 

12.2.1 User/Payload 

A user/payloail is defined as any system which Is carried by the shuttle into 
orbit, but wliicli is not In any way a functional part of the orbiter Itself, More 
specifically, unmanned satellites and spacecraft are the payloads with which 
this document is primarily concerned. 

Payloads are divided Into two distinct classes: (Ij those which separate or 
become "detached" from tlie orbiter, and (2) those whicli remain "flttached" to 
tiie siiuttlo in the associative surroundings of the cargo bay. Many detached pay- 
toads will be transported into geosynchronous or other earth orbits or placed on 
deep space trajectories using upper stage launchers. Certain detached payloads 
(known as free-flyers) will simply operate away from the orbiter in co-orbit, and 
some of these will be subsequently recovered by the shuttle for return to tiie 
ground. Usually, attached payloads will be serviced via hardwire links, while 
communications with detached payloads must use radio frequency (RF) 
cliannels. 

12.2.2 Payload/Shuttle/Ground Communications Network 

The shuttle communications and tracking system provides links between the 
orbiter and ground and between tlie orbiter and attaclied/detached payloads. 
The orbiter communicates with ground stations directly or through thoTDRSS. 
Payloads communicate with the orbiter through hardline cables (attaciied pay- 
loads) or the payload RF link (detaciied payloads). Table 12-1 lists th*^ major 
unmanned payload communication functions and the links over which they are 
handled. 

Figure 12-1 is a pictorial representation of the shuttle and the principal RF 
channels tliat comprise tlie communication links between the shuttle, payloads, 
and the {jround. The links between the shuttle and payloads are at S-band; the 
sliuttle/ground direct links are also S-band. Relay links through the Tracking 
and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) are at S-band and Ku-band. Only one detaciied 
payload may be communicated with at any time. Similarly, only one coherent

sliuttJe/ground direct Unk is available. Since, however, the FM direct link utilizes 
separate equipment, it may be worked simultaneously with the coherent direct 
link. TDRSS relay can make use of the S-band and Ku-band capabilities concur- 
retitly. Since the shuttle operates in low orbit (100 to 500 nmi), the time tliat it 
may communicate with any direct ground station is limited, while nearly con- 
tijiuous contact can be maintained using the TDRSS. 

12.2.3 Shuttle Avionic Equipment 

Table 12-2 lists by subsystem name (and acronym) tlie principal orbiter 
avionic equipment that have a role in tiie transfer of payload communication 
signals througli the orbiter, 

12.2.4 Principal End-to-End Unit Configurations 

About a dozen different end-to-end configurations are possible for payload 
telemetry and command signal transfer. In the following, the five most impor- 
tant end-to-end links are outlined with respect to tlie orbiter avionic subsystems 
and ground equipment functions involved. 

Figure 12-2 is a block diagram of the detached payload standard telemetry 
S-band direct link. Standard telemetry for NASA payloads Involves the trans- 
mission of digitally encoded data at specified bit rates. Within tlie payload itself.

tlie digital data must be modulated onto a subcarrier of specined frequency and 
with a non-return-to-zero-(NRZ)-type format. 

Standard telemetry is transmitted via the payload transponder and received, 
tracked, and demodulated aboard the orbiter by the payloid interrogator (PI). 
The payload signal processor (PSP) demodulates the subcarrier and detects the 
data, following wlilch the payload data interleaver (PDIJ and the network signal 
processor (NSP) function to multiplex the detected detached payload data from 
the PSP witli other attached payload data and orbiter data. A composite digital 
data stream is then transmitted directly to the ground station via the S-band 
network transponder. 

At the ground station, the telemetry sigml is received, demodulated, and 
detected. It is also demultiplexed so that the standard telemetry data stream, as 
it appeared at tlie input to the payload transponder, can be delivered to the 
appr.jjrlate payload/user facility. Because of noisy detection operations that 
take place in the PSP and in tlio ground data detector, some bits of information 
in the telemetry data stream received at the user's facility are in error. 

A diagram of the signal flow for the detached payload standard telemetry 
S'band relay link appears in Fig, 12-3. This configuration is nearly identical to 
the direct link just described except that the TDRS is used as an intermediate 
channel between the orbiter and ground. (It should be noted that a separate 
operating mode of the network transponder and an entirely different ground 
station and set of ground equipment are used with the TDRS link than with the 
direct link. Thus, the block diagrams that are employed to depict the end-to-end 
links should be underEtood as generic, and specific fiiglit hardware modes and 
ground equipment and configurations, apart from the Indicated generalized 
functions, are implied,) 

Standard telemetry data capability for detached payloads provides a reason- 
able degree of flexible operation. Certain payloads, however, may not be able to 
avail themselves of the standard system. To accommodate payloads whose 
telemetry formats are not compatible with the standard data rates and subcarrier 
frequency, "bent-pipe" modes of operation are provided within the shuttle's 
avionic equipment. Several signal paths acting as "transparent throughputs" 
are available for both digital and analog signals. 

Figure 124 is a diagram of the signal path for nonstandard telemetry, capable 
of supporting detached payloads with very high data rates and/or having "ana- 
log" telemetry waveforms. 

Digital data sireams at nonstandard rates or at rates higlier than 64 kbps, 
which cannot be handled by the PSP and PDI, may directly enter the Ku- 
band signal processor (KuSP), where they are either (1) QPSK-rnodulated onto a

AtialoR sjpnals may take one of two paths. If t!iey are in th-j form of a motiu- 
lalcii subearrier and do not have significant frequency coniponcnis above 2 Mil/, 
they may be hardhmlted (i.e.. one bittjiianli/ed) ami treated as "dipltal" sipnals 
by the KiiSP. On the other hand, if the anahip sipnal is baseband in nature on a 
freiiucncy iant',e up to A.S MM/, it may be itausmilted via the Ku-baud hnk 
utili^inp VM, Apain, all processing is aceomplihhed on tJie pfound by the user's 
equipment. 

Attached payloads may have digital data rate requiremenis that exceed the 
standard tetometry capacity. Thus, for data tales up to 50 Mbps. a hiph-iate data 
link utili/nip the Ku-band TDRS channel is available. The end-lo-end coiilipura- 
tion is shown in I-'ip. 12-5. 

All data streams transmitted in this mode are convolulionally encoded aboard 
the otbilct and coiwolutioivally decoded on the ptoimd. in order to provide low 
error rate coinnumicalion up to the hiphcst possible data rates. 

The final link considered is one that provides ground command capability to 
detaciicd payloads. Coniniands may be transmitted Irom the ground to the 
orbiiet by any one of tluec links: (1) S-band direct link, (2) S-band TDRS relay 
link, and (.?! Kuband TDRS relay link. Irrespeciive ot which link is used, they 
all have sinnlar porforniancc, and detected command data aboard the oibttcr is 
thoroughly checked lor validity and errors belbre it is transmitted to the pay- 
load. 

I'igiire 1 2-b shows the end-lo-end subsystems employed in an ,S-band relay 
command link. I-ncoded {ic struciuiod) payload conmumd bits at the ground 
station are multiplexed with orbitei commands and other data, arid I'N code- 
modulated in order to spread the carrier frequency spectrum. (This is a require- 
ment of the TT)R,SS forward link in order to satisfy transmitted power versus 
Ifoquen-.y llux density Umitations.) The resultant signal is then carrier-modulated 
and transmitted to the ovbiter thtovigh tiicTDRS, 

At tlie orbiter, the S band network transponder acquires, tracks, despreads 
(removes the PN code), and demodulates the composite command data stream. 
In turn, the NSP bit synchronizes and detects the command bits, while the 
MDM/CiPC performs demultiplexing and validation. 

The payload command bit stream is input to the NASA P,SP, whore it is 
transformed into the proper payload subearrier signal structure. Transmitted to 
the payload via the PI, and received, demodulated, and detected by the payload's

12.3 TDRSS TelecGmmunicatfons Interfaces 

TDRSS is a satellite-based data transfer and tracking facility. Using two opera- 
tional geostationary satellites and a, single ground facility, tlie TDRSS is able to 
service user satellites in earth orbit between altitudes of 200 and 12,000 km. 

12.3.1 General Sy.stem Configuration and Services 

The TDRSS consists of two operational satellites in geostationary orbit sepa- 
rated 130 dig in longitude, Additiontilly, an in-orbit spare satellite is available to 
replace eitlicr of tlie operational satellites in the event of a failure. Tlie principal 
ground facility that communicates with botii operational satellites Is located 
within the Wliite Sands Test Facility (WSTF). 

A user satellite is defined as an earth satellite operating generally between the 
altitude limits of 200 and 12,000 km. (Specific coverage limits are given in 
Subsection 12.3.2.) Because the TDRSS satellites are In geostationary orbit 
(approximately 35,800-km altitude), the user satellite "looks up" to establish 
communication. A single TDRSS satellite is able to "see" somewhat more tlian 
50% of all the user satelhtes at any given time. 

The RF link from the WSTF tlirougli tlie TDRSS Eatoilite to the user satellite 
is known as the forward link. The reverse situation is the return link. Since the 
TDRSS is a communication service, it is not explicitly concerned with the con- 
tents of the data that is transferred on either the forward or return link, No 
processing of data in either direction, other than reception, frequency transla- 
tion, and amplification, is performed by the satellite. Thus, the satellite func- 
tions as a "bent-pipe" repeater, with all signal processing being accomplished 
aboard the user satellite or at the WSTF. 

Four principal services are available: (1) doppler tracking, (2) ranging, (3) for- 
ward link data (command), and (4) retP'n link data (telemetry). Single access 
(SA) links (one user per assigned channel) are available at both S-band and 
Ku-band, wliile multiple access (MA) links (several users per assigned channel 
by means of spread spectrum modulation) are provided at S-band only. Multiple 
access is designed to serve relatively low data rate users (<1.5 Mbps'), while 
single access will accommodate data rates as high as 300 Mbps' at the Ku-band 
frequency. 

Finally, tlie interface between the WSTF and the user's ground facility/ 
center is provided by the NASA Ground Communication System (NASCOM). 
NASCOM's capabilities are not discussed in this document; interested readers 
are referred to [12-4].

OF POOR QUALITY 

Before proceeding to tlie detail sections that follow, it should be noted that 
it is not iJie purpose of this document to provide un exhat stive treatment of the 
TDRSS. Uather. the intent is to orient prospective users and interested readers 
to the most important features of tiie system so that a working understanding of 
the principal functions and iiow they are acconiplislied may be attained. Perfor- 
mance parameters as provided arc tlierefore somewhat abridped, and full particu- 
lars may be obtained from [124] and [12-5]. 

12.3.2 User Spacecraft Orbital Coverage 

Figure 12-7 shows tiic TDRSS satellite placement and orbital coverage for 
user satellites (12-6] . With a longitudinal spacing of 130 deg between the two 
satellites, there exists a small shadow /.one, or /one of exclusion (ZOIi), centered 
on the Indian Ocean. 

Tile ZOi; establishes the lower-aititude coverage limits for TDRSS users, and 
the amount of coverage that can be provided to user spacecraft Is a function of 
tlic user's altitude and inclination. Users at low altitudes and low inclinations 
will pass througli the ZOIi each orbit and receive tlie least coverage. Users at high 
altitudes and high inclinations will pass through the ZOE only periodically (e.g., 
a user at 1000 km and 99-deg inclination will pass through the ZOK once per 
day or less, although the duration of this passage will be greater than for a lower 
inclination satellit:;). 

For orbital altitudes greater than 1200 km, 100% coverage can be provided 
up to 2000 km for the MA service and 12,000 km for the SA service. In sum- 
mary, tlie following general coverage may be expected; 

{ 1 ) Minimum coverage of 85% at 200 km. 

(2) Coverage at 100% between 1200 and 2000 km for the MA service and 
between 1200 and 12.000 km for the SA service. 

(3) Coverage decreases above 2000 and 12,000 km for the MA and SA ser- 
vices, respectively. 

Figure 12-8 sliows tlio ZOE for several user satellite altitudes. 

12.3.3 Frequency Plan 

Figure 12-9 depicts tiie MA and SA forward and return link frequency plan, 
and Table 12-9 summarizes the number of active channels available for each type 
of data service. MA designates multiple access (available at S-band only), while 
SSA and KSA are, respectively, S-band single access and Ku-band single access. 

Figure 12-9 indicates that a single S-band frequency pair is assigned to the 
forward and return MA service. For the case of the MA return link. Table 12-9

sliows tluit 20 links are possible per satsUite. but that the sysilcm can accommo- 
date a maximum of 20 MA clianncls at any given time irrespective of whetlier 
1, 2. or 3 satellites are Involved, The reason for this ilmllation is that the MA 
satellite antenna system uses an array of lO helix antennas to form up to 2C 
independent beams directed tovi/ard user satellites. A limit ol 20 beams Is set by 
t!ie ground station equipment wliieh funiitions to actively command the satel- 
lite's beam forming network in order to place and maintain each beam on its 
designated user satellite. 

SSA services are provided for a range of assignable frequencies, while the 
KSA services operate on u sinple Ku-band frequencj' pair, llach satellite can 
provide a maximum or two SSA links and two KSA links because there are two 
independent SA retlcctor antennas per satellite, eacii having dual-frequency 
feeds. However, since SA antenna pointmg is accomplished by mechanical 
steering of the reflector, two user riatclUtes may be serviced simultaneously by 
the antenna (one at S-band and the otlier at Ku-band), provided they are both 
spatially within the beam. 

12.3.4 Definitions of User Services 

12.3.4.1 Multiple access forward Unit data. The MA forward link service througii 
cacli satellite can support only one user at a time. The TDRSS (including the 
in-orbit spare satellite) provides the capability for three MA forward link ser- 
vices. Only the two MA forward link services through the two operational 
satellites will be continually available for user support. These services will be 
time-shared by all MA users. All MA users will operate at the same frequency 
and polarization, and will be discriminated by unique PN codes and antenna 
beam pointing. MA forward link data is usually used for spacecraft command 
purposes, and is limited to a maximum bit rate of 10 kbps. 

12.3.4.2 Single access forward link data, tach satellite can provided two SSA 
Ibrward link services. The TDRSS (including the in-orbit spare satellite) provides 



583 



OF POOR QUALin' 

the capability for six SSA forward linlt services. Only the four SSA forward link 
services tliruiieli t!ic two operational satellites will be continually available for 
user support. These services will be tinic-sliared by all SSA users. SSA users will 
be discriminated by frequency, polarization, unique PN codes, and antenna 
beam pointing. An SSA forward link can also be used to provide forward link 
service with l!i";eascd signal IiiRP to an MA user. Maximum SSA data rate is 300 
kbps. 

I'acb satellite has the capability to provide two KSA forward link services. 
The TDRSS (including tiie in-orbit spare satellite) provides the capability for six 
KSA i'orward link services. Only the four KSA forward link services throufh the 
two operational satellites will be continually available for user support. These 
services will bo time-shared by all KSA users, KSA users will be discriminated by 
iiolari/ation, unique PN codes, and antenna beam pointlnp. The KSA forward 
link maximum data rate is 25 Mbps. 

12.3.4.3 Multiple access return link data, The MA return link data services 
provide simultaneous real-time and dedicated operations to low eurth-orbitinf< 
user spacecraft with real-time data rates up to 50 kbps. Return link support can 
be provided to each oi' 20 users during the entire portion of their orbit visible 
to a satellite (a minimum of &5Ti< of the orbital period). Based upon current 
mission model projections, no scheduling restrictions should be encountered for 
return link service. All MA users operate at the same frequency and polarization, 
and will be discriminated by unique PN codes and antenna beam pointing, 

12.3.4.4 Single access return link data. In general, the SA return link data 
services provide a number of data rate options depending on whether S-band or 
Ku-band links are employed. Return link service at S-band will provide data 
rates up to 12 Mbps, and a Ku-band will provide data rates up to 300 Mbps, 
althougli maximum rate services will only be provided on a priority scheduled 
basis, and will not normally be used for dedicated support to any user satellite. 
SA return link data services are lime-shared by all users. Discrimination is based 
on a combination of frequency, unique PN codes, antenna beam pointing, and 
polarization. 

12.3.4.5 Cross-support data services. The MA services may be thouglit of as 
a subset of SSA services since the MA radio frequency falls within the SSA IVo- 
quency band, and the MA data rates and formats are a subset of the SSA capa- 
bilities. Thus, any user satellite designed to operate as MA could be supported in 
the TDRSS SSA mode. The principal advantage of such cross support is tlio 
higher TDRSS satellite antenna gain (approximately 8 dB). Thus, a given user 
satellite could be designed to provide continuous real-time return link data 
operating in the MA mode, while periodically receiving SSA support of, say, 
a special high data rate experiment.

12.3.5 Forward Link Gonoral Signal Form 

At! forward link services have a common sipnal form so that the user's satel- 
lite transponder receiver may be functionally identicyl for each class of service 
(MA. iSSA. KSA). The main difference involves the ftetjvicncy conversions from 
RI' (S4>and or Ruband) to a common II". In tact, an ,''i'band transponder needs 
simply an external converter to enable it to operate with the Kii-band signal. 

l-ach for\*,iid link service sipnal consists of a PN sprcid spectrum command 
channel in carrier phase nuadralure with a PN code mi'dnlated ranpinp channel. 
The tnathcinatieal I'orni of the sipnal ispivcn by:

codes run from the same dock (approximately 3.1 MHz). Both codes arc epoch- 
synclironi/cd so that wlicn the slii!t-rt eister pcncrator which produces Ihc PNq 
code passes throuph the all "I" state, the /W| code shift-register generator is also 
pas'iinp tlirouph lis all "1" statp. Such epoch synchronization (acilitatcs PN cade 
actjujsltlon in tlic user's tiaiispondor. 

It is also noted tlral the power ratio between the I and Q channels is 10:1. 
Thus, or;;, M 'he power is devoted to the command data. No data modulates the 
Q channel. 

Tlie forward Unit signal parameters for all classes of service are given In Table 
12-10, A user transponder receiver's frequency is nominally specltied to be/. 
Tlie »omli/al carrier i'requcncy (/) transmitted by the TDRSS satellite is com- 
pensated for doppler so that the received carrier,;;^, arrives at the user space- 
craft within a predictable tolcMnce (f) of/, laJn -ft i<. This feature minl- 
nii/es the doppler resolution requirements of the u&cr transponder and the 
corresponding time to acquire, Doppler compensation is available continuously 
to facilitate reacquisitlon by the user spacecraft in the event of temporal^ loss of 
signal. Doppler compensation is inhibited during periods of coherent two-way 
doppler measurement. 

Tlio use of :i short-cycled PN code ibr the range channel allows optimization 
of the command channel PN code. This feature permits use of Gold codes for 
the command channel providing a code library with pood cross-correlation prop- 
erties. The complete PN code library, documented in [12-7] , is sufficiently large 
to allow a unique code set assignment for each user satellite. 

The PN chip rate is coherently related to the transmitted carrier frequency in 
all cases. This feature permits the user transponder to use the receiver PN clock 
(acquired before the carrier) to predict received carrier I'rcquency, thereby 
minimiz^.^g transponder complexity and acquisition time. 

Forward link data is directly modulo-2 added to the command channel PN 
stquence. Since the PN clock and carrier arc doppler-compensated, the forward 
link data will generally be asynchronous with the PN code. Command data 
greater than 300 kbps will binary-phase-shift-key (BPSK) modulate the KSA 
forward link carrier, and the range channel will not be transmitted for this 
condition. 

An example of a forward link MA servjce link budget is presented in Table 
12-11.

12.3.6 Return Link Data Groups and Modes 

The return link data services are divided into two data groups; DGl and DG2. 
DGl signal parameters are furtlier subdivided into tluee operating modes, distin- 
RUishcd as follows: 

(1) Mode 1 is used for two-way doppler and range mer.surement':. The return 
link PN code length is identical to, and epocli-r>nchroni?.ed with, the for- 
ward link PN code received from the TDRSS. Acquisition of the Mode 1 
return Hnk signal by the WSTF may take place only after the forward 
link has been acquired by the user's transponder receiver, and the trans- 
ponder is functioning in the coherent turn-around mode. When a user 
transponder functions only in Mode 1, it is not necessary to maintain for- 
ward link acquisition once tite return link lias been established. However, 
loss of forward link tracking by the user transponder must not introduce 
"transients" that can cause loss of return link tracking.

(2) Mode 2 is used when return link acquisition is desired witliout tltc 
reiiuirenient for prior foi-ward link acquisition. Tills mode of operation 
uses sliort, easily acquired PN codes. 

(3) Mode 3 is used when two-way range and dopplcr measurements arc 
required simultaneously witli higli-rate telemetry data. Restrictions on 
Mode .1 acquisition are identical to that for Mode 1. In Mode 3, the Q 

liannel contains only data and is not restricted by the I'N rate. For MA 
users, Mode 3 is available only when supported by the SSA service, 

DG2 parameters are used when the data rule requirement exceeds the capa- 
biUty of DG 1 , DG2 operation cannot provide range tracking since return link PN 
modulation is not used. Tlie DG2 carrier can be either coherently related to or 
independent of the forward link carrier frequency. Two-way dopplcr tracking 
will be provided when the DG2 carrier is coiierently related to the forward link 
carrier frequency, DG2 operates in u single mode. 



12.3.7 Return Link General Signal Form 

Like tJie forward link, a degree of commonality exists between the various 
return link signal forms. 

The mathematical form of the signal for DGI , Modes I and 2 ,is; 

s(0 = s/lPjPNjind jit) COS oi^r + y/zF^PN^it-TJDdQit) sin oj^t 

(12.3-2) 
wjiore 

to " •^''/i ~ carrier frequency 

Pf, Pq ~ component powers, with three possibilities: PqIPj = 1,2,4 

PN. , PNq = different, equal length, PN sequences 

r. = PN chip period 

(i (/ = independent data bit streams that may have identical or differ- 
ent bit rates 

Note tliat the PNq sequence is time displaced by 1/2 chip relative to the PNj 
sequence. The distinct difference between tlie signal for each mode is that the 
PN code lengths for Mode 1 are 2'^ - 2^ chips, while for Mode 2 they are 
2" - 1 chips in length. 

The mathematical form of tlie signal for Mode 3 is;

{i:..^2) Willi the exception that PJP^ = 1 or 4 lor QPSK niodiihition, BPSK 
modulation is also allowed, in whicli case y^ = or P j = 0. 

Tahlc 12-12 summarizes tlic salient return link sipnal parameters, Qiralilyinj; 
inl'orniatlon is given in the Ibllowins paragraphs. 

The user transmit frequency tbr DGJ Mode 2 or DG2 service nnisl he defined 
by the user to an accuracy of A700 Hz for MA or SSA and +5 kil/ for KSA 
wlion rcqucstinfi return link service. 

Slapgcred quadriphaso PN (SQPN) modulation is used for IXJl Modes 1 and 2. 
With this feature, tiie spectral characteristics out of a saturated power amplifier 
will to a great degree retain the spectral characteristics of the band-linjiled input 
sipnal. This results in better control o' out-of-band emissions, which provides 
more efficient communications and less interference to spacecraft using adjacent 
frequency channels. 

For Mode 1 operations, the I and Q channel PN codes are generated from a 
single linear shift register. The 1 and Q channel PN codes are identical but offset 
by at least 20,000 chips. This separation is adquate for TDRSS to uniquely 
identify each data channel without requiring a unique linear shift register lor 
each cliannel. User-unique PN code assignments (refer to [12-7]) include shift 
rcgiste- tap connections for generating the assigned codes. 

The return link data is modulo-2 added asyndrronously to the PN code (DGl , 
Modes 1, 2, and 3), In the ease of Mode I or Mode 3 operation, this eliminates 
the doppler on the PN code from alTecting the lelenictry data ryto. For Mode 2 
it eliminates the need for synchronizing the spacccral'l data block with the user 
transponder PN clock. 

The PN clock is coherently related to the trunsmittcd carrier frequency in all 
cases. This feature permits tlic user transponder to use a common source for gen- 
orating carrier and clock, and also permits TDRSS to use the PN clock to aid 
carrier acquisition.

Fnir both Mode I aiul 2 operations, the return link can liavc either ii single 
telemetry data signal or two independent data signals. E'or u single data signal, 
tlic identical data must appear sitmiltaneously on the I and Q channels. For two 



592 



OF P>ji^.'l (JLaLlW 

independent data signals, one data signal will appear on the I channel, Cite other 
on the Q channel. The I and Q channel power division in the user spacecraft 
transmitter can be veiglited up to a maxhnum weiglit of 1 :4 for either a single 
data signal or two Independent data signals. 

For Mode 3, the return link can Inve either a single telemetry data signal or 
two independent data signals. For a single data signal, the data will appear only 
on the Q channel while the I channel will be used for range tracliing only. For 
two independent data signals, one data signal will appear on the 1 channel and 
the other on the Q channel. The I and Q channel power division in the user 
spacecraft transmitter can be weighted up to a maximum weiglit of 1:4 for 
cither a single data signal or two independent data signals. 

The DG2 return link can have eitlier a single telemetry data signal or two 
mdependent data signals. The I and Q channel power division In the user space- 
craft transmitter can be either 1:1 or 1:4. 

The use of convolutional data coding is mandatory for all MA configurations, 
and the data rate restrictions given for the MA modes in Table 12-12 are for tlie 
convolutionally encoded (rate 1/2) data symbols. Whenever Bi^ formats are 
specified, all data rate restrictions for all services must be reduced by a factor 
of 2. 

The choice of which data format should be used depends upon how the user 
wishes the recovered data to be made available or channelized out of the TDRSS 
WSTF, For the options available, [12-4, Section 3.3.3] should be consulted, 

TDRSS S-band return link data modes are summarized in Table 12-13. An 
example return link MA service link budget is shown in Table 12-14. 

12.3.8 Ranging and Doppler 

The TDRSS provides one-way doppler measurements and two-way range and 
doppler measurements. One-way doppler measurements are available on return 
cliannels for all mode and/or data group configurations. Two-way doppler mea- 
surements are available to all user spacecraft for which the coherent transmit/ 
receive carrier frequency turnaround ratio is 240/221 for MA and SSA and 
1600/1469 for KSA. Two-way range measurements are available to user space- 
craft operating DGI Modes 1 and 3 when the user transmitted FN code is time- 
synchronized to the PN code received from the TDRSS. 

Tlie TDRSS will provide the following simultaneous tracking services on a 
continuous basis; 

(1) One-way doppler measurement for any 10 return links. 

(2) Two-way range and doppler measurement for three MA links (includes 
the in-orbit spare satellite).
