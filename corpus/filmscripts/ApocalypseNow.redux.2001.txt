EXT. A SIMPLE IMAGE OF TREES - DAY

Coconut trees being VIEWED through the veil of time or a
dream.  Occasionally colored smoke wafts through the FRAME,
yellow and then violet.  MUSIC begins quietly, suggestive
of 1968-69.  Perhaps "The End" by the Doors.

Now MOVING through the FRAME are skids of helicopters, not
that we could make them out as that though; rather, hard
shapes that glide by at random.  Then a phantom helicopter
in FULL VIEW floats by the trees-suddenly without warning,
the jungle BURSTS into a bright red-orange glob of napalm
flame.

The VIEW MOVES ACROSS the burning trees as the smoke ghostly
helicopters come and go.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SAIGON HOTEL - DAY

A CLOSE SHOT, upside down of the stubble-covered face of a
young man.  His EYES OPEN...this is B.L. WILLARD.  Intense
and dissipated.  The CAMERA MOVES around to a side view as
he continues to look up at a ROTATING FAN on the ceiling.

EXT. IMAGES OF HELICOPTERS - DAY

They continue to fly slowly, peacefully across the burning
jungle.  The colored smoke comes and goes.  Morrison
continues with "The End".

INT. SAIGON HOTEL - DAY

The CAMERA MOVES slowly across the room...and we SEE
WILLARD, a young army captain.  He looks out the window to
the busy Saigon street.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)                             *
          Saigon...shit.  I'm only in Saigon.
          Every time, I think I'm gonna wake
          up back in the jungle.

He moves back to the bed, lies down.  He's unshaven,
exhausted, probably drunk.  We SEE alcohol bottles, photos,
documents scattered on the table.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          When I was home after my first
          tour, it was worse.  I'd wake up
          and there'd be nothing.  I hardly
          said a word to my wife until I
          said yes to a divorce.  When I was
          here, I wanted to be there.  When
          I was there...all I could think of
          was getting back into the jungle.
          I'm here a week now.  Waiting for
          a mission.  Getting softer.  Every
          minute I stay in this room, I get
          weaker.  And every minute Charlie
          squats in the bush...he gets
          stronger.  Each time I looked
          around...the walls moved in a little
          tighter.

He's up now, naked, going into a frenzy, drinking, doing
some sort of martial arts, eventually collapsing onto the
floor.

                                                FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. SAIGON HOTEL - STAIRWAY - DAY

Two extremely sharp army men walk up the stairs to Willard's
room, a SERGEANT and a PRIVATE.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Everyone gets everything he wants.
          I wanted a mission.  And for my
          sins, they gave me one.  Brought
          it up to me like room service.

They knock on the door.  A second knock.

                      SERGEANT
          Captain Willard, are you in there?

                      WILLARD
          Yeah I'm coming.

The army men wait for him.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          It was a real choice mission.  And
          when it was over, I'd never want
          another.

Willard unlocks the door and opens it.  The men react to
his condition.

                      WILLARD
          What do you want?

                      SERGEANT
          Are you all right, Captain?

                      WILLARD
          What's it look like?

Willard turns back into the room, sits on the bed.  The
Sergeant follows him.

                      SERGEANT
          Are you Captain Willard?  505th
          Battalion?  173rd Air-Borne?
          Assigned to SOG?

Willard looks over at the Private by the door.

                      WILLARD
          Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the
          door?

The private enters the room, closing the door behind him.

                      SERGEANT
          We have orders to escort you to
          the airfield.

                      WILLARD
          What are the charges?  What did I
          do?

                      SERGEANT
          There's no charges, Captain.

The sergeant opens the letter he has been holding.

                      SERGEANT
          You have orders to report to Com-
          Sec Intelligence at Nah Trang.

He holds up the letter in front of Willard's face so he
can see it.  We see the word 'RESTRICTED' across the top.

                      WILLARD
          I see.

                      SERGEANT
          All right?

                      WILLARD
          Nah Trang, for me?

                      SERGEANT
          That's right.

The sergeant folds the letter back and puts it back in the
envelope.  Willard doesn't move.

                      SERGEANT
          Come on, Captain, you still have a
          few hours to get cleaned up.

                      WILLARD
          I'm not feeling too good.

He lays his head on the pillow and closes his eyes.

                      SERGEANT
          Captain?
               (to private)
          Dave, come here and give me a hand.
          We've got a dead one.

The two of them move over to Willard and pick him up.

                      SERGEANT
          Come on Captain, Let's go take a
          shower.

                      WILLARD
          Don't be an ass.

                      SERGEANT
               (to private)
          Get hold of him good.  We're going
          to take a shower, Captain.

They drag him into the shower, and turn on the cold water.

                      SERGEANT
          Stand under this, Captain.

Willard shudders and yells as they begin to clean him up.

EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY

A darkly painted Huey lands in a guarded military compound
somewhere in Nah Trang.  The two enlisted men jump out of
the helicopter, leading Willard, who seems in much better
shape.  As he gets out he sees a platoon of new men drilling
in the hot hazy sun.  They are clean and pale.

                      MEN (Chanting)
          I wanna go to Vietnam.
          I wanna kill a Vietcong-

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          I was going to the worst place in
          the world, and I didn't even know
          it yet.  Weeks away and hundreds
          of miles up river that snaked
          through the war like a circuit
          cable...plugged straight into Kurtz.

He follows the escort across the fields as the platoon
drills.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          It was no accident that I got to
          be the caretaker of Colonel Walter
          E. Kurtz's memory, any more that
          being back in Saigon was an
          accident.  There was no way to
          tell his story without telling my
          own.  And if his story is really a
          confession, then so is mine.

They approach a civilian-type luxury trailer.  It is
surrounded by concertina wire, and its windows have grenade
protection, but it still seems out of place in this austere
military base.

CLOSER ON WILLARD

He stands before the door for a moment, as the M.P.s
guarding the trailer check his papers.

INT. TRAILER - DAY

Cool and comfortable, furnished like home.  Pictures on
the walls, certificates, photos of Presidents Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon and other mementos decorating the room.

A small table is covered with linen and place settings for
three.

Willard enters.  He salutes, and the COLONEL salutes him
back.

                      COLONEL
               (to Willard)
          Captain.  Good.  Come on in.

                      WILLARD
          Thank you, sir.

                      COLONEL
          Stand at ease.

Willard notices somebody O.S. and reacts.

                      WILLARD
          General.

The General crosses over to a cabinet and picks up a pack
of cigarettes, as the CAMERA REVEALS a CIVILIAN; probably
with the Department of Defense, sitting at the bar, and a
GENERAL sitting on a sofa.

The colonel turns and offers Willard a cigarette from the
pack.

                      COLONEL
               (to Willard)
          Do you want a cigarette?

                      WILLARD
          No thank you, sir.

                      COLONEL
               (indicating civilian)
          Captain, have you ever seen this
          gentleman before?

                      WILLARD
          No, sir.  Not  personally.

                      COLONEL
          You've worked a lot on your own,
          haven't you, Captain?

                      WILLARD
          Yes, sir, I have.

                      COLONEL
          Your report specifies intelligence,
          counter-intelligence with Com-Sec,
          I Corps.

                      WILLARD
          I'm not presently disposed to
          discuss those operations, sir.

There is a pause as the colonel lights his cigarette, then
moves to the sofa.  He bends down and picks up a dossier,
looks at it.

                      COLONEL
          Did you not work for the CIA in I
          Corps?

                      WILLARD
               (pause)
          No, sir.

                      COLONEL
          Did you not assassinate a government
          tax collector...Quang Tri province
          June 18, 1968?

Willard doesn't answer.

                      COLONEL
          Captain?

                      WILLARD
          Sir, I am unaware of any such
          activity or operation, nor would I
          be disposed to discuss an operation,
          if it did in fact exist, sir.

A pause.  Willard is tired and confused and hung over, but
he is handling himself well.  The general rises.

                      GENERAL
          I thought we'd have a bit of lunch
          while we talked.  I hope you brought
          a good appetite, Captain.

Willard gets up and moves towards the dining table with
the general and the civilian.  They sit down.

                      GENERAL
          I noticed that you have a bad hand
          there.  Are you wounded?

                      WILLARD
          Had a little fishing accident on R
          and R, sir.

                      GENERAL
          Fishing on R and R?

                      WILLARD
          Yes, sir.

                      GENERAL
          But you're feeling fit?  You're
          ready for duty?

                      WILLARD
          Yes, General.  Very much so, sir.

The food is being passed around.

                      GENERAL
          Well, let's see what we have here.
          Roast beef, and usually it's not
          bad.
               (to civilian)
          Try some, Jerry.  Pass it around.
          To save a little time, we might
          pass both ways.
               (to Willard)
          Captain, I don't know how you feel
          about this shrimp, but if you eat
          it, you'll never have to prove
          your courage in any other way.

The colonel, who is not eating with them, walks to the
table, holding a small photo.

                      COLONEL
               (to Willard)
          Captain, you've heard of Captain
          Walter E. Kurtz?

He shows the photo to Willard.

INSERT THE PHOTO

It's an eight-by-ten black-and-white portrait of an army
officer wearing a beret.

                      WILLARD
          Yes, sir.  I've heard the name.

The Colonel accidentally drops the dossier.  Papers, photos,
etc., scatter all over the floor.  He stoops down to pick
them up.

                      COLONEL
          Jesus...Operations officer, Fifth
          Special Forces.

                      GENERAL
          Luke, would you play that tape,
          for the captain, please?
               (to Willard)
          Listen to it carefully, Captain.

The Colonel moves to a tape recorder and turns it on.

                      MALE VOICE (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
          "October 9, 04:30 hours, Sector
          Peter, Victor, King."

                      GENERAL
          These were monitored out of
          Cambodia.  It's been verified as
          Colonel Kurtz's voice.

All the men, including Willard, listen in wonder.

                      KURTZ (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
          "I watched a small snail, crawling
          on the edge of a straight razor.
          That's my dream.  It's my nightmare.
          Crawling, slithering, along the
          edge of a straight razor, and
          surviving."

                      MALE VOICE (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
          "Transmission 11, received '68,
          December 30, 05:00 hours, Sector
          King, Zulu, King".

                      KURTZ (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
          "But we must kill them.  We must
          incinerate them.  Pig after pig.
          Cow after cow.  Village after
          village.  Army after army.  And
          they call me an assassin.  What do
          you call it, when the assassins
          accuse the assassin?  They lie.
          They lie and we have to be merciful,
          for those who lie.  Those nabobs.
          I hate them.  I really hate them."

The TAPE is TURNED OFF.

                      GENERAL
          Walter Kurtz was one of the most
          outstanding officers this country's
          ever produced.  He was brilliant.
          He was outstanding in every way.
          And he was a good man, too.  A
          humanitarian man.  A man of wit
          and humor.  He joined the Special
          Forces, and after that, his ideas,
          methods, became...unsound.  Unsound.

                      COLONEL
          Now he's crossed into Cambodia
          with this Montagnard army of his,
          that worship the man like a god,
          and follow him every order, however
          ridiculous.  Well, I have some
          other shocking news to tell you.
          Colonel Kurtz was about to be
          arrested for murder.

                      WILLARD
          I don't follow sir.  Murdered who?

                      COLONEL
          Kurtz had ordered the execution of
          some Vietnamese intelligence agents.
          Men he believed were double agents.
          So he took matters into his own
          hands.

                      GENERAL
          Well, you see, Willard, in this
          war, things get confused out there.
          Power, ideals, the old morality,
          and practical military necessity.
          But out there with these natives,
          it must be a temptation to be God.
          Because the rational and the
          irrational, between good and evil.
          And good does not always triumph.
          Sometimes, the dark side overcomes
          what Lincoln called the better
          angels of our nature.  Every man
          has got a breaking point.  You
          have and I have them.  Walter Kurtz
          has reached his.  And, very
          obviously, he has gone insane.

Willard looks from the colonel to the general to the
civilian.  They are intensely interested in his response,
which they want to be "yes."

                      WILLARD
               (carefully)
          Yes, sir.  Very much so, sir.
          Obviously insane.

The three men pull back, satisfied.

                      COLONEL
          Your mission is to proceed up the
          Nung River in a navy patrol boat,
          pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu
          Mung Ba, follow it, learn what you
          can along the way.  When you find
          the colonel, infiltrate his team
          by whatever means available, and
          terminate the colonel's command.

                      WILLARD
               (to General)
          Terminate...the colonel?

                      GENERAL
          He's out there operating without
          any decent restraint, totally beyond
          the pale of any acceptable human
          conduct.  And he is still on the
          field commanding troops.

                      CIVILIAN
          Terminate with extreme prejudice.

The civilian hands Willard a cigarette, and lights it for
him.

                      COLONEL
          You understand, Captain, that this
          mission does not exist, nor will
          it ever exist.

CLOSE ON WILLARD

Smoking the cigarette, thinking about the mission.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. THE MEKONG DELTA - DUSK

A HUEY helicopter flying over the mountains moves over
rice paddies, the Mekong River, MOVING CLOSER until we
view a dock area.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          How many people had I already
          killed?  There were those six that
          I knew about for sure...close enough
          to blow their last breath in my
          face.  But this time it was an
          American, and an officer.  That
          wasn't supposed to make any
          difference to me, but it did.

We SEE a small patrol boat.  It moves away from the dock,
out into the delta.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Shit.  Charging a man with murder
          in this place was like handing out
          speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
          I took the mission.  What the hell
          else was I gonna do?  But I really
          didn't know what I'd do when I
          found him.

EXT. PBR - DAY

We are CLOSE ON THE BOAT, the PBR.  Willard is lying on
the deck, his eyes closed.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          I was being ferried down the coast
          in a navy PBR, a type of plastic
          patrol boat, pretty common sight
          on the rivers.  They said it was a
          good way to pick up information,
          and move without drawing a lot of
          attention.  That was okay.  I needed
          the air and the time.  Only problem
          was, I wouldn't be alone.

Willard awakens to see a young black crewman squatting in
front of him, brushing his teeth.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          The crew were mostly just kids.
          Rock 'n' rollers with one foot in
          their graves.
               (to Clean)
          How old are you?

                      CLEAN
          Seventeen.

VIEW ON CHEF, lanky, with a mustache.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          The machinist, the one they called
          Chef, was from New Orleans.  He
          was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.
          Probably too tight for New Orleans.

VIEW ON LANCE, blonde, handsome, laid-back surfer type.
He is sunning himself with a reflector.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Lance, from the forward 50's, was
          a famous surfer from the beaches
          south of L.A. To look at him, you
          wouldn't believe he's ever fired a
          weapon in his life.

VIEW ON CLEAN, the young black man brushing his teeth.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Mr. Clean was from some South Bronx
          shit-hole, and I think the light
          and the space of Vietnam really
          put the zap on his head.

VIEW ON THE CHIEF, an older black man.  He is at the helm,
studying a map of the delta.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Then there was Phillips, Chief.
          It might have been my mission, but
          it sure as shit was the Chief's
          boat.

                      PHILLIPS
               (to Willard)
          There's about two points where we
          can draw enough water to get into
          the Nung River.  They're both hot,
          belong to Charlie.

                      WILLARD
          Don't worry about it.

He takes out a pack of cigarettes and offers one to the
Chief.

                      CHIEF
          Don't smoke.  You know, I've pulled
          a few special Ops in here.  About
          six months ago, I took a man who
          was going past the bridge at Do
          Lung.  He was regular army, too.
          I heard he shot himself in the
          head.

Willard lights his cigarette as the boat continues to move
out into the ocean.

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

Willard is sitting, smoking a cigarette, and looking down
at a large pouch.  He opens the flap and WE SEE there are
several dossiers inside.  He opens one, thumbing through
the material.  WE SEE the personal letters, photographs,
reports, files-the entire case history of Colonel Walter
E. Kurtz.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          At first, I thought they handed me
          the wrong dossier.  I couldn't
          believe they wanted this man dead.
          Third-generation West Point, top
          of his class...Korea, Airborne,
          about a thousand decorations, etc.,
          etc. I'd head his voice on the
          tape and it really put the hook in
          me, but I couldn't connect up that
          voice with this man.  Like they
          said, he had an impressive career.
          Maybe too impressive.  I mean,
          perfect.  He was being groomed for
          one of the top slots in the
          corporation.  General, chief of
          staff, anything.  In 1964, he
          returned from a tour with Advisory
          Command in Vietnam, and things
          started to slip.  His report to
          the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon
          Johnson was restricted.  Seems
          they didn't dig what he had to
          tell them.  During the next few
          months, he made three requests...for
          transfer to Airborne training,
          Fort Benning, Georgia...and was
          finally accepted.  Airborne?  He
          was thirty-eight years old.  Why
          the fuck would he do that?
          1966...joins Special Forces, returns
          to Vietnam.

Suddenly we HEAR a sound, a distant EXPLOSION.  The crew
all stop whatever they are doing, look out beyond the shore
and the green jungled hills.  There is a distant ROLLING
NOISE, like interrupted thunder.  The buffeting and noise
continue.

                      CHEF
          What's that?

                      WILLARD
          Arc light.

                      LANCE
          What's up?

                      WILLARD
          B-52 strike.

                      CHEF
          What's that?

                      WILLARD
          Arc light!

                      CHEF
          I hate that.  Every time I hear
          that, something terrible happens.

                      CLEAN
          Charlie don't never see them or
          hear them, man.

                      LANCE
          There they are!

He points up to the sky.

EXT. SKY - FULL SHOT - DAY

Way up-past any clouds and barely discernible we SEE the
black silhouettes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor trails
streaming white against the dark blue sky.

                      CLEAN
          Concussion'll suck the air out of
          your damn lungs.

                      CHEF
          Something terrible is going to
          happen.

                      CLEAN
          Smoke!  Secondary burning.

FULL SHOT-COASTLINE

Black smoke rises from the jungle.

                      CHIEF
          Hueys over there.  Lots of Hueys.

                      WILLARD
          Let's have a look Chief.

The Chief hands Willard the field glasses.  He looks through
them out at the burning coastline.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          It was the Air-Cav, First of the
          Ninth.
               (to Chief)
          That's them.

All the crew move to battle positions, get their flak
jackets, helmets, etc.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Our escorts to the mouth of Nung
          River.  But they were supposed to
          be waiting for us another thirty
          kilometers ahead.  Well, Air Mobile.
          Those boys just couldn't stay put.

The PBR moves to the beach through a chaos of other boats,
low-flying helicopters, and soldiers rushing by onshore.

EXT. BEACH AND VILLAGE - DAY

A vast field of devastation, smashed and burning huts,
shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf.
Willard jumps off the boat, Clean and Lance fall in behind
him, they head ashore.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          First of the Ninth was an old
          cavalry division that had cashed
          in its horses for choppers, and
          gone tear-assign around Nam looking
          for shit.  They'd given Charlie a
          few surprises in their time here.
          What they were mopping up now hadn't
          even happened yet an hour ago.

They make their way across the beach, weapons in hand.
Explosions go off around them; there is smoke everywhere.
Suddenly they are stopped by a VOICE.

                      VOICE (O.S.)
          Go on, keep going.  It's for
          television.  Don't look at the
          camera.

Willard and the two who are following stop incredulously,
their M16s still in hand.

                      VOICE (O.S.)
          Go on, go on, keep going.  Don't
          look at the camera.

REVERSE ANGLE OF WHAT THEY SEE

A NEWS TEAM, dressed in fatigues and combat dress.  A
director, cameraman, and soundman; the director keeps waving
them by.

                      DIRECTOR
               (to Troops)
          Just go by like you're fighting.
          Don't look at the camera.  It's
          for television.  Just go through.
          Just go by.  Keep on going.

Willard, Lance, and Clean run by, staring into the camera
the entire time.

They make their way toward the village under siege.  Willard
stops to talk with a SERGEANT, as a medevac helicopter
takes off in the background.  The Hueys and Loches in the
sky drown out most of their conversation.

CLOSE ON WILLARD

Looking up as the Hueys sweep in low.

                      WILLARD
          Where Can I find the CO?

                      SERGEANT
          That's the colonel coming down!

He points to a particular Huey in the sky, and moves to a
clear spot by a large bomb crater.  He takes out a smoke
bomb and pulls the pin and lays it down in the clearing,
as it spews out orange smoke.

                      WILLARD
               (to his men)
          CO's on that chopper.

Willard moves back to Lance and Clean, they all kneel,
trying to avoid the propeller wash, as they look up.

FULL VIEW

The helicopter is heavily laden with machine guns, etc.,
as it lands in the middle of the clearing.

A tall, strong-looking man jumps out of the helicopter.
This is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE.  He puts on his Air-Cav
hat, then stands to his full immense height and with his
hands on his hips, surveys the field of battle.

                      KILGORE
          Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
          back about a hundred yards.  Give
          me some room to breath.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Yes, sir!

Kilgore starts walking, then turns and shouts to the
LIEUTENANT.

                      KILGORE
          Bring me my body cards!

                      LIEUTENANT
          Yes, sir!

The Lieutenant moves back to the helicopter and Kilgore
continues forward toward a besieged village.  A CAPTAIN
from tank division comes running down the street, stops in
front of Kilgore.

                      CAPTAIN
          I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
          I've got five tanks broken down.

                      KILGORE
          All right with the tanks.  It's
          all right, Captain.

The captain turns and exits, as the sergeant walks up
leading Willard, Lance, and Clean.

                      WILLARD
          Captain Willard.

They exchange salutes.  Willard takes out a set of orders
and hands them to him.

                      WILLARD
          I carry priority papers from Com-
          Sec Intelligence, II Corps!  I
          understand Nah Trang has briefed
          you on the requirements of my
          mission.

                      KILGORE
          What mission?  I haven't heard
          from Nah Trang.

Kilgore hands the orders to the major, who has joined him.
He looks at them and shakes his head "no."

                      WILLARD
          Sir, you're supposed to escort us
          into the Nung!

The major hands the orders back to Willard.  By this time
the lieutenant has run back in from the helicopter with
the deck of playing cards.  He hands them to Kilgore.

                      KILGORE
          We'll see what we can do about
          that!  Just stay out of my way
          till this is done, Captain!

Kilgore cracks the plastic wrapping sharply, takes the
deck of new cards and fans them.  Then he strides past
willard and his two young crewmen with no further
acknowledgement-the others follow.

He moves through the shell-pocked field of devastation,
soldiers gathering around him.  As he comes to each V.C.
corpse, he drops a card on it, carefully picking out which
card he uses.

                      KILGORE
               (to himself)
          All right, let's see what we have.
          Two of spades.  Three of spades.
          Four of diamonds, six of
          clubs...there isn't one worth a
          jack in the whole bunch.  Four of
          diamonds...

He crosses on down the street, distributing his cards on
top of the dead V.C. corpses.

Willard, Lance, and Clean have been following Kilgore.
Willard bends down and picks up one of the cards from a
dead V.C.

                      LANCE
          Hey, Captain, what's that?

                      WILLARD
          Death cards.

                      LANCE
          What?

                      WILLARD
          Death cards.  Lets Charlie know
          who did this.

MOVING SHOT OF KILGORE

As he moves through the corpses, selecting a card and
flipping it on a body, or putting it behind an ear.

                      KILGORE
               (to a shell-shocked
               G.I)
          Cheep up, son.

As they pass by a well, two G.I.s jump out of it.

                      G.I.
          Fire in the hole!

They all hit the deck, as a tremendous explosion comes out
of the well.

Kilgore, his lieutenant, and major stop in back of a large
gathering of villagers.  They are standing around a G.I.
and ARVN Interpreter, listening to them.

                      SOLDIER (OVER P.A.)
          This is an area that's controlled
          by the Vietcong and North
          Vietnamese!  We are here to help
          you!  We are here to extend a
          welcome hand to those of you who
          would like to return to the arms
          of the South Vietnamese government.

A line of villagers are throwing all their belongs on top
of a large APC parked by the road, and filing into the
carrier.  Kilgore stops and watches the G.I.s help them,
then he moves over and looks at the inside, where the
villagers are crowded together, waiting and scared.

                      KILGORE
               (to woman)
          Get in!  Hurry up!
               (to soldier)
          Move it out!

                      SOLDIER (OVER P.A.)
          This is an area that is controlled
          by the Vietcong and North
          Vietnamese...

Kilgore turns and continues down the burning street with
his group.  He comes upon a wounded V.C., groaning.  The
man has tied a wash bowl over his belly-and is groaning
for water . Kilgore turns to a soldier.

                      KILGORE
          What's this?

                      SOLDIER (OVER P.A.)
          This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.
          About the only thing holding his
          guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

                      KILGORE
               (to ARVN soldier)
          Yeah?  What does he have to say?

                      ARVN SOLDIER
          This soldier is dirty V.C. He wants
          water.  He can drink paddy water.

                      KILGORE
          Get out of here!  Give me that
          canteen.

He pushes the ARVN soldier away, turns, and then gets a
canteen full of water from the lieutenant.

                      KILGORE
          Any man who's brave enough the
          fight-
               (to ARVN soldier)
          Get outta here!  I'll kick you
          fucking ass!  Any man brave enough
          to fight with his guts strapped on
          him can drink from my canteen any
          day.

He stoops down-starts to quench the prisoner's thirst from
his canteen.  A soldier rushes up to him.

                      SOLDIER
          Colonel, I think one of those
          sailors is Lance Johnson, the
          surfer.

                      KILGORE
          Where?  Here?  You sure?

The solder points at Lance.

                      SERGEANT
          Down there.

Kilgore rises, hands the canteen back, and moves over to
Willard and his crew.  Looks at Lance.

                      KILGORE
          What's your name, sailor?

                      LANCE
               (salutes)
          Gunner's Mate Third Class L.
          Johnson, sir.

                      KILGORE
          Lance Johnson the surfer?

                      LANCE
          Yes, sir.

Kilgore smiles, sticks out his hand.

                      KILGORE
          Well, it's an honor to meet you
          Lance.  I've admired your nose
          riding for years.  Your cutback,
          too.  I think you have the best
          cutback there is.

                      LANCE
          Thank you, Sir.

                      KILGORE
          You can cut out the "sir" crap,
          Lance.  I'm Bill Kilgore.  I'm a
          goofy foot.

Kilgore leads Lance off to meet some other soldiers.
Willard's entire top-priority mission has been out in the
background.

                      KILGORE
               (making introductions)
          I want you to meet some guys.
          This is Mike from San Diego.  Johnny
          from Malibu.  We're pretty solid
          surfers.  None of us are anywhere
          near your class, though.

                      MIKE
          No way.

Lance shakes their hands.  Kilgore moves on, the group
follow him.

                      KILGORE
          We do a lot of surfing around here,
          Lance.  I like to finish operations
          early, fly down to Yung Tau for
          the evening glass.  Been riding
          since you got here?

                      LANCE
          No way.  I haven't surfed since I
          been here.

They stop to see Catholic Mass going on in the middle of a
graveyard.  Many helicopters continue to hover overhead.
Willard looks around him, looks at the Mass being held, as
the Priest continues his alter on a gravestone in the midst
of the bombing and evacuations.

EXT. AREA BY DESTROYED VILLAGE - NIGHT

The area is illuminated by large cans filled with sand and
jet fuel, bonfires, and the burning village in the
background.  There are maybe fifteen to twenty helicopters
secured against the wind, in orderly patterns.  Men are
grouped around the fires, eating steaks, hot dogs,
hamburgers, drinking beer.  It has the bizarre resemblance
of some sort of barbarian beach party.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Kilgore had a pretty good day for
          himself.  They choppered in the T-
          bones and the beer...and turned
          the L.Z. into a beach party.  The
          more they tried to make it like
          hone, the more they made everybody
          mis it.

Kilgore is seated at the fire with some of his men,
strumming a guitar and singing.

                      KILGORE
               (to the Chief)
          Make my meat rare.  Rare but not
          cold.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I
          guess.  He loved his boys, and you
          felt safe with him.  We was one of
          those guys that had a weird light
          around him.  You just knew he wasn't
          going to get so much of a scratch
          here.

Kilgore looks at Willard, who more or less sits by himself.

                      KILGORE
          What happened to your mission,
          Captain?  Nah Trang forget all
          about you?

He laughs.  Willard gets up, carrying the map he's patiently
been holding.  He lays it down in front of Kilgore; squats
and points.

                      WILLARD
          Sir, two places we can get into
          the river.  Here and here.  It's a
          pretty wide delta, but these are
          the only two spots I'm really sure
          of.

                      KILGORE
          That village you're pointing at is
          kind of hairy, Willard.

                      WILLARD
          What do you mean "Hairy", sir?

                      KILGORE
          It's hairy.  Got some pretty heavy
          ordinance.  I've lost a few recon
          ships in there now and again.

The Chief comes over, leans in to take a look at the map.

                      KILGORE
          What's the name of that goddamn
          village, Vin Drin Dop or Lop?
          Damn gook names all sound the same.
               (to one of the surfer
               soldiers)
          Mike, you know anything about this
          point at Vin Drin Dop?

                      MIKE
          That's a fantastic peak.

                      KILGORE
          Peak?

                      MIKE
          About six foot.  It's an outstanding
          peak.  It's got both the long right
          and left side, with a bowl section
          that's unbelievable.  It's just
          tube city.

Kilgore considers this.

                      KILGORE
          Well, why didn't you tell me that
          before?  A good peak.  There aren't
          any good peaks in this whole shitty
          country.  It's all goddamn beach
          break.

                      MIKE
          It's really hairy in there, sir.
          That's where we lost McDonald.
          They shot the hell out of us there.
          That's Charlie's point.

Willard sees his chance, jumps in.

                      CHIEF
          We may not be able to get the boat
          in.  The draft at the mouth of
          that river may be too shallow.

The colonel rises, looks at Willard.

                      KILGORE
          We'll pick your boat up and put it
          down like a baby, right where you
          want it.  This is the First of the
          Ninth, Air-Cav, son.  Air mobile!
          I can take that point and hold it
          just as long as I like, and you
          can get any place up that river
          that suits you, young Captain.
          Hell, a six-foot peak!  All right.
          Take a gunship back to division.
               (to Lance)
          Lance, go with Mike and let him
          pick out a board for you.  And
          bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-
          six.

Mike reacts, doubtful.

                      KILGORE
          What is it, soldier?

                      MIKE
          It's pretty hairy in there.  It's
          Charlie's Point.

Kilgore looks at him, exasperated.

                      KILGORE
          Charlie don't surf!

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. HELICOPTER FIELD OUTSIDE DESTROYED VILLAGE - DAY

It is the next morning.  The helicopters, pilots, and men
are ready for battle.  The helicopters slowly start up, as
the soldiers scurry to their various positions.

We FOLLOW Kilgore and his group, including Willard, the
Chief, Clean, Lance, etc., as they walk across the field.
They all get into a helicopter, except Kilgore.  He takes
off his hat, reaches in, and pulls out his helmet, puts it
on.

ANGLE ON OUR CREW

Seated in their helicopter, looking out.

                      CHEF
          Jesus, Clean, you ain't believe
          this.  Look.

WHAT THEY SEE:

The PBR being airlifted up by the helicopter.

                      CLEAN
          Hey!  They're picking up the boat!

BACK TO KILGORE'S HELICOPTER

Kilgore picks up some gloves and starts to put them on as
he crosses to the gunner by the helicopter.

                      KILGORE
               (to soldier)
          How you feeling, Jimmy?

                      SOLDIER
          Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

                      KILGORE
               (to bugler)
          All right, son, let 're rip.

The bugler begins to play as Kilgore climbs into the
helicopter.

EXTREME FULL SHOT

THE HELICOPTER takes off, rotors spinning, gas turbines
belching fire from their jet pipes, sand and dust as twenty
helicopters RISE.

NOISE ROAR OVER CAMERA.  The helicopters deploy into a
formation.

NEW VIEWS - HELICOPTERS

They move THROUGH THE FAME, almost a dance of dragonflies.

INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED.SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD, OTHERS -

Willard looks ahead, Kilgore sits near the door.  Below,
they see the jungle whisk by and are suddenly over the
ocean, low and fast.

moving by.  The men waiting, sitting on the floor, sitting
on their helmets, looking back at him.

FULL VIEW OF THE HELICOPTERS

They are magnificent in the sky as they split into two
columns.

INSIDE HELICOPTER

Kilgore cranes his neck and leans out to watch the waves,
then turns back to Lance.

                      KILGORE
          I never have got used to a light
          board.  I can't get used to one.
          I'm used to a heavy board.

                      LANCE
          I know, it's a real drag.

                      KILGORE
          You prefer a heavy or light board?

                      LANCE
          Heavier.

                      KILGORE
          Really?

                      LANCE
          Yeah.

                      KILGORE
          I thought young guys like lighter
          boards.

                      LANCE
          Can't ride the nose on those things.

The pilot alerts the colonel.

               (to Kilgore)
          Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust

          Eagle Thrust, put on heading two-
          seven-zero, assume attack formation.

                      PILOT
          That's a Roger, Big Duke.  We're
          going in hot.  Here we go.

                      KILGORE
               (to Lance)
          We'll come in low out of the rising
          sun, and about a mile out, we'll
          put on the music.

                      LANCE
          Music?

                      KILGORE
          Yeah, I use Wagner.  Scares the
          hell ot of the slopes.  My boys
          love it.

                      LANCE
               (to Willard)
          Hey, they're gonna play music!

INT. PBR CREW'S COPTER - DAY

As they near the destination, several of the soldiers take
off their helmets and sit on them.  The PBR crew reacts
with surprise.

                      CHEF
          How come all you guys sit on your
          helmet?

                      SOLDIER
          So we don't get our balls blown
          off.

Chef laughs, looks around.  Then he takes off his own helmet
and sits on it.

          Make it loud.  This is a Romeo Fox
          Trot.  Shall we dance?

A HAND switches on the tape deck.  MUSIC COMES UP, Wagner's
"Ride of the Valkyrie", blaring through the external
speakers of the choppers, as they make their decent into
enemy territory.

EXT. THE COMMAND HELICOPTER - DAY

With enormous twelve-driver loudspeakers BLASTING out the
music.

INT. PBR CREW'S COPTER - DAY

EXT. COPTERS - DAY

We SEE the bombs and surfboard attached to the bottom of
the helicopters.

EXT. VIETCONG VILLAGE - FULL-SHOT - DAY

Typical quiet Vietnamese coastal village, rather large,
built along the beach and trees with rice paddies behind.
Sampans are pulled into a cove where the are being unloaded.
We SEE different aspects of the life of the village, the
people working there.

MEDIUM SHOT - SCHOOLYARD

A teacher and little girl come out into the courtyard,
quickly followed by other students pouring from the
schoolhouse in the background.  A North Vietnamese soldier
runs in to the teacher, who then turns back to the children.
The soldier waves to the children to get out of the area.

CLOSER ON THE TEACHER

gathering children together.  Peasants run through as the
teacher starts the children running out.  One small boy
remains, an older girl runs back to get him and run after
the others .

Soon the village is buzzing with activity.  Trenches are
used to pass weapons and ammunitions, young V.C. - both
men and women.  N.V.A. regulars rush along the trenches to
take their positions.

          We're over the village right now.
          I think I see a vehicle down in
          the courtyard.  I'm gonna check it
          out.

                      KILGORE
          Well done, Hawks.  Well done.
          Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan

                      PILOT #2
          Got a vehicle on the bridge, fifty

               (to Kilgore)
          Nice shoot, Bill!

The copter suddenly lurches over to the right.  The ship
is jostled around badly.  There are some flames and smoke
and it looks as though the copter has been seriously hit.
There is confusion and we realize that the bullets have
hit a box of flares which have gone off inside the copter.

                      KILGORE
               (to soldiers)
          Un-ass that shit and get it out of

EXT. VILLAGE - COPTERS LANDING - DAY

A small group of copters come down and land, kicking up
clouds of dust.  Soldiers start to jump off, run for cover,
as shells hit the ground.  All jump out except for one
YOUNG SOLDIER.

                      YOUNG SOLDIER
          I'm not going!  I'm not going!
          I'm not going!

Another soldier comes back, grabs him by the arm, and pulls
him out of the copter.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Kilgore's copter kicks up a cloud of dust as it sets down.
Kilgore pop's out, followed by Lance and other officers
and strides across the beach looking out toward the sea.

They all dive except Kilgore; he's watching a big set.
The shell EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards away,
sending up a geyser of spray.  Kilgore is unmoved.  The
others get up and join him.

They nod "yes" meekly.

                      KILGORE
          That's good son, because you either
          surf or fight.  That clear?

They turn and leave.  Kilgore grabs an M16 from one of the
guards-they all think he's going to shoot the surfers or
someone-they run back uneasy.

                      KILGORE
          One get going.  I'll cover for
          them.
               (to others)
          And bring a board Lance.

He cocks the weapon-Lance looks around uneasily.

                      WILLARD
               (to Lance)
          We can't do shit till the boat
          gets here.

                      KILGORE
          Lance, I bet you can't wait to get
          out there.

                      LANCE
          What?

                      KILGORE
               (gesturing to ocean)
          See how they break both ways?  One
          guy can break right, one left,
          simultaneous.  What do you think
          of that?

                      LANCE
          Bill, I think we ought to wait for
          the tide to come up.

He starts away.

                      KILGORE
          Lance, come here.  Look.

                      SOLDIER (O.S.)
          Incoming!

A shell screams over-they all hit the dirt except Kilgore.
It explodes, throwing sand through the air.  Kilgore leans
down yelling over the noise.

                      KILGORE
          The tide doesn't come in for six
          hours!  You wanna wait here for
          six hours?

          Goddamnit!  Don't you think it's a

          to surf this place!  I'll surf

He rips off his shirt and scarf.

                      KILGORE
               (to soldier)
          Give me that R-T, soldier.

          Bomb them into the stone age, son.

He throws the R-T back to the soldier.  We SEE from among
the Vietnamese prisoners being herded, a woman running,
covered with blood, carrying a bloody baby.  She is trying
to offer it up to the colonel, but a soldier is dutifully
trying to keep away from him.

                      SOLDIER
          No, ma'am, no!

                      KILGORE
          Let me take care of this now.
               (indicates soldier's
               rifle)
          Get that out of here!

Kilgore intercedes, pushing the soldier's rifle away.

                      KILGORE
               (to woman)
          Come here, now.  All right.  Sorry,
          you can't go!

He takes the wounded baby in his hands, tenderly, and calls
a soldier over.

He hands the baby to the soldier.  Woman protests.

          No, no . You've got to go with
          him.  Go!  Go!

          back.  This is gonna be a big one.

Kilgore returns to Lance, who is cowering in a foxhole
with Willard.

                      KILGORE
          Don't worry.  We'll have this place
          cleaned up in a jiffy, son.  Give
          me those shorts.

He turns to his aide, who hands him a pair of Air-Cav
trunks.

                      KILGORE
               (to Lance)
          These are from the Air-Cav, a
          present from me and the boys.  I
          wanna see you do your stuff out
          there.

Jets break the trees, we HEAR the EXPLOSIONS of 20mm
CANNONS, and then the entire tree line ERUPTS INTO FIRE
with an immense amount of napalm.

Kilgore stands there, hands on hips, looking at the burning
jungle in the distance.

                      KILGORE
          You smell that?  Do you smell that?

                      LANCE
          What?

                      KILGORE
               (pointing to trees)
          Napalm, son.  Nothing else in the
          world smells like that.
               (crouches down)
          I love the smell of napalm in the
          morning.  You know, one time we
          had a hill bombed for twelve
          hours...and when it was all over,
          I walked up.  We didn't find one
          of them, not one stinking dink
          body.  The smell, you know that
          gasoline smell?  The whole hill-
          smelled like-victory.

He looks of nostalgically.  A shell comes in and HITS in
the background.  Willard and the soldiers react; Kilgore
ignores it.

                      KILGORE
          Someday this war's gonna end.

A tremendous sadness enveloping him.  The he stands up and
walks off.  Willard turns and looks toward him.  He
understands what the colonel is saying to him.

ANGLE - KILGORE - WALKING OUT TOWARD THE SURF

Suddenly he senses something.  He stops, lifts his hand-
then licks his fingers and puts then in the air.

                      KILGORE
               (to Lance)
          Lance!  The wind!  The Wind!  It's
          blowing onshore!  It's gonna blow
          this place out.  It's gonna ruin
          it!

Sure enough, there is a rushing breeze that increases.

                      LANCE
          Not cool!

                      KILGORE
          It's the goddamn napalm, that's
          what's doing it!

                      WILLARD
          I'm really sorry, Colonel, but I'm
          afraid that does it.  The kid's
          got a reputation.  You can't expect
          him to surf those sloppy waves.

                      KILGORE
          I understand what you're saying.

          Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.  I
          couldn't surf that  crap.

MEDIUM VIEW - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE

Willard calmly goes about picking up Lance's clothes as
Kilgore apologizes to Lance for the conditions.

                      KILGORE
          Look, I apologize.  It's not my
          fault.  The waves are getting blown
          out by the napalm.  It's the bombs
          causing a vortex with the wind.

                      LANCE
          I accept your apology.

                      KILGORE
          Hang around just twenty minutes.

                      WILLARD
          Some other time, Bill.

                      KILGORE
          Just twenty minutes!

Willard grabs Lance and walks him away from Kilgore.

                      LANCE
          I'm an artist!

                      WILLARD

Kilgore takes the megaphone.

                      KILGORE
               (into megaphone to
               surfers)
          Let's give it a try, guys.  One

               (to Lance)
          Look, Lance...

Lance and Willard keep walking, fast.

                      WILLARD
          You through surfing?  Wanna say
          good-bye to the colonel?

          No!

                      WILLARD
          You sure?

          Yeah!

                      WILLARD
          Then let's get the fuck out of
          here!

Kilgore is left frantic on the beach with his megaphone.

                      KILGORE
               (calling to them)
          Lance, it's the fucking napalm!
          Just wait twenty minutes!  Fuck!

Willard and Lance run like hell toward the PBR in the
distance.  In his frustration, Kilgore throws the megaphone
in the air and wanders off.

AT THE PBR

The crew help Willard and Lance climb onto the boat.
Suddenly Willard sees something and stops.  In a pile of
equipment that the Hueys left are two surfboards-willard
looks at them.

                      WILLARD
               (to PBR)
          Don't leave without me!

                      CLEAN
          Where the fuck are you going?

He runs to the copter where Kilgore's surfboard is attached.

                      WILLARD
          Incoming!

All the soldiers at the copter duck and during that moment,
Willard snatches the colonel's surfboard.  A soldier tries
to stop him.

                      SOLDIER
          That's the colonel's surfboard!

                      WILLARD
          Get the fuck off me!  It's mine!

He rushes back to the boat, handing the board up to Clean,
and scampers aboard.  Clean stuffs the board in the stern.
The boat turns, ENGINES RUNNING HARD AND ROARS OFF toward
the deeper water of the river.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD

The PBR passes the burned-out village, through the destroyed
bridge, and heads out toward the river.

EXT. PBR - DAY

The crew relaxing.  Clean sits down next to Chef, who is
rolling a joint.

                      CLEAN
          Chef, light up, man.  Come on,

          Light up.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Someday this war's gonna end.
          That'd be just fine with the boys
          on the boat.  They weren't looking
          for anything more than a way home.

                      CHEF
          Captain?

Chef offers the joint to Willard.  He waves it off.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Trouble is, I'd been back
          there...and I knew that it just
          didn't exist anymore.

          All right.  That's grass.  That's
          shit.

Willard pours himself a drink from a bottle.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          If that's how Kilgore fought the
          war...I began to wonder what they
          really had against Kurtz.  It wasn't
          just insanity and murder.  There
          was enough of that to go around
          for everybody.

EXT. RIVER - FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - DUSK

It is parked, hidden under some trees along the riverbank.

                      CHEF (O.S.)
          I'm not here...I'm walking through
          the jungle gathering mangos, and I
          meet Raquel Welch.  I can male
          nice mango cream pudding.  You
          know, kind of spread it around on
          us...

Chef is lying on his back, his eyes closed.  Lance is
standing on the riverbank next to the PBR.  He is taking a
leak.  He finishes, then turns and squats next to a blue
bucket and starts washing his Air-Cav trunks.

                      CHEF
          ...See, she's into mangoes, too.
          She's like one limb above me.
          We're both in the jungle here,
          nude.

We HEAR a helicopter coming toward the vicinity of the
boat.  The wind begins to hit the trees and boat.

                      CLEAN
               (to Chief)
          Hey, Chief?  Here comes that colonel
          guy again.

The SOUND of the helicopter gets closer...and an
indistinguishable language on a loudspeaker.  Lance gathers
his bucket and soap and jumps up on the PBR.

                      KILGORE (OVER P.A.)
          "I will not harm or hurt you.
          Just give me back the board, Lance.
          It was a good board and I like it.
          You know how hard it is to find a
          board that you like."

The helicopter drones on into the distance-the same speech
starts again farther off-finally the noise ceases.

                      CHEF
          Determined motherfucker, ain't he?
          Cock-sucker!

Willard snaps off a salute at the passing copter.  It
disappears into the distance.

                      CLEAN
          Jesus Christ.  That guy's too
          fucking much, man.

          Do you think he would've shot us?

                      WILLARD

          or if he saw me taking his board.

          Hey, Chef, make some room back

They stow the board in the back of the boat, hiding it.

                      CHIEF
          I wonder if that's the same chopper.

                      WILLARD
          Hell, he's probably got them all
          over the river with that recording.
          We'll have to hold up here till
          dark, Chief.
               (to Lance)
          Don't worry Lance, he won't follow
          us too far.

          Maybe you'll get a chance to know
          what the fuck you are in some
          factory in Ohio.

Chef steps forward with a plastic bucket.

                      CHEF
          Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those

          Take somebody with you.

                      WILLARD
          I'll go with him.

He turns and follows Chef off the PBR.  They climb up the
bank, away from the boat, into the jungle.

EXT. JUNGLE - MEDIUM VIEW - DUSK

Chef and Willard cautiously walk through the dark
underbrush.  We SEE fragments of them, LOSE then
occasionally, and just MOVE through the jungle.  WE HEAR
this conversation throughout:

                      WILLARD
          Chef?

                      CHEF
          Yes, sir.

                      WILLARD
          How come they call you that?

                      CHEF
          Call me what, sir?

                      WILLARD
          Chef.  'Cause you like mangoes and
          stuff?

                      CHEF
          No, sir.  I'm a real chef.  I'm a
          saucier.

                      WILLARD
          Saucier?

                      CHEF
          Yes, sir.  See, I come from New
          Orleans.  I was raised to be a
          saucier.  A great saucier.

                      WILLARD
          What's a saucier?

                      CHEF
          We specialize in sauces.  Gotta be
          a mango tree here somewhere...Then,
          I was supposed to go to Paris, to
          the Escoffier School.  But then I
          got orders for my physical.

As they move deeper into the jungle.

                      CHEF
          Well, I joined the navy.  Heard
          they had better food.  Cook school,
          that did it.

                      WILLARD
          Oh, yeah?  How's that?

Chef puts down his bucket and rifle, takes a leak.  Willard
takes a few steps farther in the jungle and then sits by
him on a log.

                      CHEF
          You don't wanna hear about that.
          They lined us up in front of a
          hundred yards of prime rib.  All
          of us, you know, looking at it?
          Magnificent.  Magnifique.  Next
          thing, they're throwing the meat
          into these big cauldrons.

Willard has heard something in the jungle during this
explanation.  He becomes alert.

                      CHEF
          All of it.  Boiling it.  I looked
          inside, man, it was turning grey.
          I couldn't fucking believe that
          one!  That's when I applied for
          radioman's school, but they-

Chef looks up, seeing Willard standing a distance away,
poised with his rifle.  Willard signals to him to come
cautiously.  He motions to Chef to move with him, each
covering the other.  They walk a few yards from where they
have heard something move.

                      CHEF
          What is it?  Charlie?

MEDIUM SHOT - PANNING - WILLARD

moving through the jungle cautiously, he is comfortable in
this environment.  He signals and directs his way very
expertly, giving silent instructions to Chef on how to
move with him.

They seem to have the intruder localized and proceed very
quietly toward where he is.

MEDIUM SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

Suddenly the grass folds almost to Willard, and a huge
TIGER leaps out at them, snarling magnificently.  They
fire wildly, emptying their clips.

                      CHEF
          It's a motherfucking tiger!  It's
          a tiger, man!  A tiger!

He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a man
can be.

                      CHEF
          Motherfucking tiger!

Willard backs out of the clearing, covering the bushes and
runs, scared out of his head as well.  They fire their
M16s indiscriminately running back to the boat, screaming.

FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

The crew is armed.  They've heard the screaming.  Lance
has the twin fifties pointed into the jungle.  Chef comes
screaming out of the brush.  Throws his rifle in the boat
and dives headfirst after it.

                      CHIEF
          Battle stations.  Lance, up front.
          Get on your sixty, Clean.

                      CHEF
          Fucking tiger!

                      CLEAN
          Let's go!

                      CHEF
          Chief, you were right.  Never get
          out of the fucking boat!

                      CHIEF
          Clean, bring that 60 forward.

                      CHEF
          Never get out of the boat!  I gotta
          remember!  Gotta remember!  Never
          get out of the boat!

                      CHIEF
          How many is it?

                      CHEF
          A fucking tiger!

                      CLEAN
          What?

                      CHEF
          Tiger!

                      CHIEF
          Tiger?

                      CHEF
               (going berserk)
          I'm done with this goddamn fucking
          shit!  You can kiss my ass on the
          county square, because I'm fucking
          bugging out!  I don't fucking need
          it!  I didn't get on the goddamn A
          train for this kind of shit!  All
          I wanted to do is fucking cook!  I
          just wanted to learn to fucking
          cook, man!

The others try to calm him down.

                      LANCE
          You're all right.  You're all right.

                      CHEF
          All right.  It's gonna be all right.
          It's gonna be all right.  Never
          get out of the boat.  'Bye, tiger!
          'Bye tiger!

The boat pulls away as he continues ranting about the tiger.

CLOSE ON WILLARD

Looking back into the jungle.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Never get out of the boat.
          Absolutely goddamn right.  Unless
          you were going all the way.

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - NIGHT

The PBR moves down the dark, silent river through the night.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Kurtz got off the boat.  He split
          from the whole fucking program.
          How did that happen?  What did he
          see here that first tour?

Willard lights a cigarette and holds a flashlight as he
looks at the dossier.  As he speaks we see CLOSE SHOTS on
the newspaper articles, letters, and photos.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Thirty-eight fucking years old.
          If you joined the green berets,
          there was no way you'd ever get
          above colonel.  Kurtz knew what he
          was giving up.  The more I read
          and began to understand, the more
          I admired him.  His family and
          friends couldn't understand it.
          And they couldn't talk him out of
          it.  He had to apply three times,
          and he put up with a ton of shit,
          but when he threatened to resign,
          they gave it to him.  The next
          youngest guy in his class was half
          his age.  They must've thought he
          was some far-out man humping it
          over the course.  I did it when I
          was nineteen, it damn near wasted
          me.  A tough motherfucker.  He
          finished it.  He could've gone for
          general, but he went for himself
          instead.

MEDIUM VIEW - OF THE PBR

gliding up the river.  Chef is sitting in the back of the
boat, writing a letter.  He is using a flashlight to see
by, as he reads to himself outloud as he writes.

                      CHEF
               (writing letter)
          Dear Eva.  Today was really a new
          one.  Almost got eaten by a fucking
          tiger.  Really un-fucking
          believable, you know?  We're taking
          this guy, Captain Willard, up river,
          but he hasn't told us yet where
          we're taking him...

Clean is at the helm, singing to himself, the Chief is
sleeping.  Willard looks at an article about Kurtz in a
magazine.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          October, 1967.  On special
          assignment, Kontoom Province, Two-
          Corps...Kurtz staged Operation
          Archangel with combined local
          forces.  Rated a major success.
          He received no official clearance.
          He just thought it up and did it.
          What balls.  They were going to
          nail his ass to the floorboards
          for that one.  But after the press
          got a hold of it, they promoted
          him to full colonel instead.  Oh,
          man, the bullshit piled up so fast
          in Vietnam, you needed wings to
          stay above it.

Suddenly, from around a bend, the boat is illuminated by a
strange artificial light.  Lance and Chief are awakened.
Willard reacts as he looks out toward the light.  It becomes
brighter and brighter as they move closer.

WHAT THEY SEE:

EXT. HAU PHAT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The PBR goes by the base, tents, oil drums, sandbagged
bunkers, etc., but the biggest surprise of all is a huge
oval STAGE built in the water, lit by banks of lights.
Preparations for some sort of show are in progress.

They all react, incredulous, as the PBR pulls into the bay
and up to the dock.

                      CLEAN
          This sure enough is a bizarre sight
          in the middle of all this shit.

                      CHIEF
               (to Willard)
          Expecting us this time?

                      WILLARD
          Damned if I know.

It looks like an amusement park, with strings of lights,
etc.

                      CHEF
          Jesus Christ...

EXT. SUPPLY DOCK AREA - NIGHT

The supply docks of this base.  Tents, oil drums, sandbagged
bunkers, helicopters, tanks, guns, and men.  As they walk,
Chef and Clean stop a moment and look at a group of
motorcycles.  The dock is crowded with all kinds of goods,
freezers, refrigerators, etc., all the nonessentials for
fighting a war.

                      CLEAN
          Hau Phat.  You ever been up here
          before, Chef?

                      CHEF
          I bet you could score up here.

                      CLEAN
          Yo, man, check out the bikes, man.
          Yamaha, Suzuki.

                      CHEF
          That's a good one.

                      CLEAN
          Yeah, Sukiyaki.

Willard moves on, Chef and Clean catch up with him.

                      CLEAN
          This must be the guy.

                      WILLARD
          Right over there.

Willard and the men approach a harried SERGEANT at a
requisition desk, filling out papers, answering questions,
shouting out orders to the frenetic activity around him.
There are soldiers scurrying back and forth, loading and
unloading supplies.  They constantly interrupt the sergeant
with their questions.

Chef and Clean stop in front of the sergeant.

                      CLEAN
          Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR-
          Five...

                      SERGEANT
          Move!  We have one hour, that's
          all!
               (to Clean)
          What do you want?

                      CHEF
          Can I get some Panama Red?

                      SERGEANT
          Panama Red?  Yeah, I'll get you
          Panama Red.

                      CLEAN
          Sergeant.

                      SERGEANT
          Destination?

                      CLEAN
          I don't have a destination.

                      SERGEANT
          You can't get a goddamn thing
          without a destination.

Willard steps in.

                      WILLARD
          Sergeant.

                      SERGEANT
          I need a destination.  I can't do
          a goddamn thing about it.

                      WILLARD
          Hey, Sarge, these guys are with
          me.  Destination classified.  I
          carry priority papers from Com-Sec
          Intelligence, II Corps.

                      SERGEANT
          Listen, sir, it's a real big night-
               (to another soldier)
          Eight dollars for that camera-

With unexpected rage, Willard suddenly reaches up and grabs
the Sergeant by the collar, pulling him down across a table,
really frightening him.  Everybody is quite surprised.

                      WILLARD
          Just give them some fuel.

                      SERGEANT
          You got it.

Willard lets go of the sergeant, almost embarrassed for
the show of temper.  The sergeant goes back behind his
desk and starts signing papers.

                      SERGEANT
          Listen, Captain...I'm really sorry
          about tonight.  It's really bad
          around here.  Just take this over
          to the man at the supply desk and
          you got it.

He tears off a requisition and hands it to one of the trio.

                      SERGEANT
               (to crew)
          Listen, would you guys like some
          press box seats for the show?  You
          want those?  The show, man, out
          here.  The bunnies.

                      LANCE
          The Playboy bunnies?

The sergeant finally leaves the trio, grabs a bottle of
cognac, and moves to Willard.  Hands him the bottle.

                      SERGEANT
          Hey, listen, Captain...on the house.
          No hard feelings.

Willard looks down at the bottle in his hand and then up
at the stage.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

The SOUND of ENGINES is heard.  A HUEY and TWO LOCHES
descend from the clouds.  The Loches hover and circle,
while the Huey descends onto the platform stage.  There is
a large black-and-white PLAYBOY INSIGNIA painted on the
nose.

EXT. STAGE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The entire area around the stage and right up to the barbed
wire is mobbed with hundreds of seething American men.
Some of these boys have just gotten here, others have been
in the jungle for months.  It's the Vietnam military version
of a happening.  Guys from all walks of life, from the
cities, guys with flowers in their hair and peace signs
around their necks, other guys with their short-time sticks
and war medallions around their necks.  Black G.I.s
congregate together with their clenched-fist black power
medallions.  There are signs and posters and graffiti
everywhere.  Some guys have guitars, everyone seems to
have a camera.  Rummaging, sitting, waiting expectantly,
before the enormous stage, which is protected by rings of
concertina wire, a moat, and M.P.s every three feet at
riot control positions.  Many joints and pipes are being
passed around.  Snapshots are being taken.  It has a strong
resemblance to a love-in or even Woodstock.  Except that
they're all in various degrees of combat fatigues, and
they're all men.

CHEF, CLEAN, LANCE, WILLARD AND THE CHIEF move down an
aisle to their seats.  It is through WILLARD'S EYES that
we see this spectacle, bad every so often we will see an
enthusiastic Lance, Chef, and Clean.  The Chief remains
noncommittal, and somewhat bored.  To the others, it's a
wonder of wonders.

Over by the dock, behind the chain-link fence, there is a
group of VIETNAMESE who have gathered to watch the show.
They have brought rice, food, etc. They will watch and
react throughout, along with the American soldiers who are
standing guard in front of them.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

The Playboy copter descends onto the stage.  The door of
the Huey slides open and TWO YOUNG GREEN BERETS step out
with their M16s to varied CATCALLS.  When this abates, a
young and extremely well-dressed man emerges.  He is the
epitome of the Hollywood agent.  He's informal, high-strung,
and good at what he does.  His presence causes some stirring
and occasional shouts of "ripoff" from the men.  He gets a
microphone from the stage, then walks to the front and
addresses the men.

                      AGENT
          How you doing out there?
               (beat and reaction)
          I said how you doing out there?
               (beat and reaction)
          Wanna say hello to you from all of
          us up here, to all of you out there,
          who work so goddamn hard on
          Operation Brute Force.  Hello, all
          you Paratroopers out there!  And
          the Marines!  And the Sailors!  We
          wanna let you know that we're proud
          of you, 'cause we know how tough
          and how hard it's been!  Yeah!
          And to prove it, we're gonna give
          you some entertainment we know
          you're gonna like!

The band starts its rock 'n' roll amp, playing the Creedence
Clearwater Revival rendition of "Suzy Q".

                      AGENT
          Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty!
          Miss Nay, Miss Terri Tersay!  And
          the Playmate of the year, Miss
          Carrie Foster!

Two very beautiful PLAYMATES in exotic, brief costumes
come out of the helicopter.  They are TERRI and SANDRA,
and they start swaying to the music.

                      SANDRA
          Hello, out there!

The two playmates jump down and dance to the front of the
stage.  The G.I.s go crazy and the girls dance their erotic
dance.  In the meantime.  The two Green Berets at the
helicopter help out the PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR, CARRIE FOSTER.

The Berets carry the Playmate out on their rifles to the
center of the stage, and put here down.  She dances forward
and joins the other two girls and the front.  Carrie is
dressed in a Western outfit.  They all dance to "Suzy Q".

VIEW OF THE CROWD

Appropriately, they go wild.

                      MARINE
          I'm here, baby!  I'm here!

                      LANCE
               (to Terri)
          You fucking bitch!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - THE AGENT

Looking at little worried.

ANGLE ON WILLARD AND THE CHIEF

watching the spectacle.  Willard takes a drink from the
bottle that was given to him by the supply sergeant.

HIS POV

The three Playmates going through all their gyrations.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD

Reacting, shaking his head.  Chef, Lance, and Clean all
think it's fantastic.

VIEW ON THE CROWD

Audience continues to react as the three Playmates sway
and hump.  Fights are breaking out.  Some of the G.I.s
pull out centerfolds of the three girls from under their
uniforms.

                      MARINE
          Sign my centerfold!

He leaps madly, climbing up on the stage.  Other guys start
to follow him.  The M.P.s try to stop them but to no avail.
Before you know it, a mba is storming the stage.

VIEW ON AGENT

Knows the show is over.

                      AGENT
               (to Pilot)
          Start her up.
               (to M.P.s)
          Get the girls!  Let's go!
               (to crowd)
          So long!

The Playmates are helped back into the helicopter.  The
rotors whine and the Huey lifts off just as the first of
the enthusiast mob reaches it.  The agent sets off a smoke
bomb to disperse the crowd.  Some guys are even hanging
onto the skids of the helicopter.  They finally let go and
fall into the water below, as the helicopter flies away.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Charlie didn't get much U.S.O. He
          was dug in too deep or moving too
          fast.  His idea of great R and R
          was cold rice, and a little rat

          death, or victory.

EXT. HAU PHAT - DAY

As the PBR pulls away from the Hau Phat area, Willard looks
back at the clean-up operations, a helicopter hovers over
the littered area, shirtless men sweep and mop up the stage,
burn trash; others dismantle the floating lights.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          No wonder Kurtz put a weed up
          Command's ass.  The war was being
          run by a bunch of four-star clowns,
          who were gonna end up giving the
          whole circus away.

EXT. PBR - DAY

Chief is steering the boat.  Chef is looking at a Playboy
magazine centerfold of Terri.

                      CHEF
          You know, man, that was far fucking
          out.  I collected every picture of
          her since she was Miss December.
               (showing Clean the
               centerfold)
          Hey, Clean, look at that.  She was
          here, man!  I even wrote to the
          cunt.  She didn't write me back.

                      CLEAN
          You can get really hung up on these
          broads, like that cat in the delta.

                      CHEF
          Yeah.  What cat?

As Clean talks, Chef tears the centerfold out of his
Playboy, then kneels down by the bulkhead in back of the
wheel.  He tapes the centerfold onto the bulkhead.

                      CLEAN
          The one that went up for murder?
          He was an army Sergeant.  This
          cat, he really dug his Playboy,
          man.

As he continues, Lance moves to the back of the boat and
starts unwrapping the plastic from his new water skis.

                      CLEAN
          I mean, this cat, when the thing
          arrived, he was there to meet it,
          man!

                      CHEF
               (indicating photo)
          Look at these beautiful fucking
          jugs, man!

                      CLEAN
          Anyway, he was working ARVN patrols,
          had one of them cocky gook asshole
          lieutenants, and one day the gook
          took his magazine and wouldn't
          give it back!  Cat said "Gimme my
          magazine back!"  Good said, "You
          shut up.  I have you court-
          martialed", you know?

                      CHEF
          Typical fucking ARVN, man.

                      CLEAN
          The gook went too far.

                      CHIEF
          Chef, take the wheel.

Chef takes the wheel of the boat as the Chief moves back
and starts brushing his teeth.  Lance continues to unwrap
his skis.

                      CLEAN
          Sticking pinholes and mutilating
          the centerfold and shit like that.
          And the sergeant said, "You better
          not do that to her.  You leave
          your shitty little gook hands off
          of that girl!"  Gook say, "Fuck
          you!"  In Vietnamese, right?
          Sergeant, man, he just couldn't
          handle it no more.  He just picked
          up his iron-

He picks up an M16 rifle to demonstrate.

                      CLEAN
          -flipped it to rock 'n' roll and
          boom!  Gave that little zero a
          long burst straight through the
          Playboy mag.  It blew his ass clear
          out off the dock.  There wasn't no
          more lieutenant that day.  That
          was it for his ass.

                      CHEF
          They burn him for it?

                      CLEAN
          The sergeant?  Yeah, man.  They
          stuck his ass in the L.B.J. It's
          too bad he didn't get no medals or
          nothing.

He puts the rifle back in the rack.  Disappears down the
hole of the ship.  They all shake their heads at the cruel
injustice of life.

                      CHEF
          Fucking ARVN, man.  They should've
          killed the fuck.  Should've given
          that fucker a Silver Star.  Bummer
          for the gook, though, ain't it?

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

We HEAR a radio station playing.  Willard is seated looking
through the dossier, documents from the C.I.A.

                      RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO)
          Good morning, Vietnam.  I'm Army
          Specialist Zack Johnson on A.M.N.V.
          It's about eighty-two degrees in
          downtown Saigon right now, also
          very humid...

Clean is standing on the front of the boat, he has a small
transistor radio in his hand.

                      RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO)
          ...and we have an important message
          for all G.I.s who are living offbase
          from the mayor of Saigon.  He's
          like you to hand the laundry up
          indoors, instead of the windowsills.
          The major wants you to keep Saigon
          beautiful.  And now, here's another
          blast from the past going out to
          Big Sam, who's all alone out there
          with the First Battalion, 35th
          Infantry, and dedicated by the
          Fire Team and their groovy C.O.
          The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction."

The music comes on, Clean starts dancing, keeping time to
"Satisfaction." The others cheer him.

                      CHEF
          Work out, Clean!  Get down, bubba!
               (to Lance)
          Hang on, Lance!

We SEE that Lance is water-skiing behind the PBR, waving
to the guys.

                      CLEAN
               (dancing)
          Can you dig it, man?  Can you dig
          it?
               (to Chef)
          I see you're right on target.
               (to group)
          Work out!  Yeah!  Yeah!

The boat passes a Vietnamese fishing boat, capsizing it in
its wake.

VIEW ON WILLARD

He's found himself in a corner in the boat.  He looks to
the front where Clean is moving and dancing to the MUSIC,
to the rear where Lance is water-skiing, and looks down to
his dossier, with its odd assortment of photographs,
reports, and letters.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          "Commitment and Counterinsurgency"
          by Walter E. Kurtz.  "As long as
          our officers and troops perform
          tours of duty limited to one year,
          they will remain dilettantes in
          war, and tourists in Vietnam.  As
          long as cold beer, hot food, rock
          'n' roll, and all the other
          amenities remain expected norm,
          our conduct of the war will only
          gain impotence.  We need fewer
          men, and better.  If they were
          committed, this war could be won
          with a fourth of our present force."

FULL SHOT - THE PBR CREW

The Chief is at the helm.  He takes off his sunglasses and
looks straight ahead, reacting.

HIS POV:

Two PBR's coming straight at them.  The lead PBR is headed
on a collision course.

                      CLEAN
          Shit.  Chicken time.  You ain't
          shittin', bro. They're
          motherfuckers.

                      LANCE
          Who is that?  What's going on?

All are looking forward.  The Chief grabs the loud-hailer.

                      CHIEF
               (over loud-hailer)
          Is that you, Lazzaro?

                      CHEF
               (to Chief)
          Don't chicken out.

The lead PBR keeps coming on in a game of "chicken," the
rock music blaring from its speakers.  Then it swerves at
the last possible moment and fishtails past.  One of its
CREWMEN moons our crew.  Lance, Chef, and Clean shout back
and give them the finger.

                      LOUDSPEAKER
          Chicken!

The other PBR fishtails past also, causing a lot of
turbulence in the water.  The crew gives our boys the
finger, then one of them throws a SMOKE BOMB.  It lands on
the canopy.

The smoke bomb spews out its YELLOW SMOKE, and suddenly
the canopy catches on fire.

                      CHIEF
          Fire on the canopy!

Chef grabs a fire extinguisher and tries to snuff the fire
out.

                      CHEF
          I got it!  Get out of there!

Chief keeps roaring down the river as the others continue
to fight the fire.  Finally they get it out . Willard stands
there, dumbfounded, and reacting, as we:

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

The PBR continues down the river.  Lance gives a handful
of palm leaves to Chef, who is sitting up on top of the
canvas roof, trying to patch up the hole that was caused
by the fire.  Clean has a pair of drumsticks and is beating
out a drum rhythm, really getting into it.

Willard studies the dossier; some photos and Vietnamese
I.D. cards.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Late summer, autumn 1968.  Kurtz's
          patrol into the highlands is coming
          under frequent bush.  The camp
          started falling apart.  November.
          Kurtz orders assassinations of
          three Vietnamese men and one woman.
          Two of the men were colonels in
          the South Vietnamese Army.  Enemy
          activity in his old sector dropped
          off to nothing.  Guess he must
          have hit the right four people.

                      GENERAL (O.S.)

          He joined the Special Forces, and
          after that he...

BACK TO WILLARD

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          The army tried one last time to
          bring him back into the fold.  And
          if he'd pulled over, it would have
          been forgotten.

                      GENERAL (V.O.)
          ...unsound.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          But he kept going.  And he kept
          winning it his way.

                      GENERAL (V.O.)
               (to Willard)
          ...with this Montagnard army of
          his.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          And they called me in.

                      GENERAL (V.O.)
               (to Willard)
          ...like a god, and follow every
          order, however ridiculous.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          They lost him.  He was gone.
          Nothing but rumors and random
          intelligence, mostly from captured
          V.C. The V.C. knew his name by
          now, and they were scared of him.
          He and his men were playing hit
          and run all the way into Cambodia.

Clean's drum rhythm is annoying Willard.  He puts a map
back into his dossier, rises, and looks at Clean, pissed,
then looks to the Chief.

                      CHIEF
          Clean.

Clean stops drumming, moves away.

                      WILLARD
               (to Chief)
          How long has that kid been on this
          boat?

                      CHIEF
          Seven months.

                      WILLARD
          He's really specializing in busting
          my balls.

                      CHIEF
          Very possibly, Captain, he thinks
          the same of you.

Willard moves over to Chief.

                      WILLARD
          Oh, yeah?  What do you think, Chief?

ANGLE ON CLEAN

Clean gives Willard the finger behind his back.

                      CHIEF
          I don't think.  My orders say I'm
          not supposed to know where I'm
          taking this boat, so I don't.  But
          one look at you and I know it's
          gonna be hot, wherever it is.

Willard comes into the cabin, looks at the Chief.

                      WILLARD
          We're going up river, about seventy-
          five clicks about the Do Lung
          bridge.

The Chief reacts, figuring it out almost immediately.

                      CHIEF
          That's Cambodia, Captain.

                      WILLARD
          That's classified.  We're not
          supposed to be in Cambodia, but
          that's where I'm going.  You just
          get me close to my destination,
          and I'll cut you loose.

                      CHIEF
          All right, Captain.

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

The PBR moves down the river.  Willard is studying the
dossier, holding a LETTER from Kurtz to his son.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
               (reading letter)
          "Dear Son.  I'm afraid that both
          you and your mother will have
          worried at not hearing from me
          during the past weeks, but my
          situation here has become a
          difficult one.  I have been
          officially accused of murder by
          the army.  The alleged victims
          were four Vietnamese double agents.
          We spent months uncovering then
          and accumulating evidence.  When
          absolute proof was completed, we
          acted.  We acted like soldiers.
          The charges are unjustified.  They
          are, in fact, and under the
          circumstances of this conflict,
          quite completely insane."

The boat moves past some DEAD AMERICAN PILOTS.  Their bodies
are lying in the water, on the bank, and in the trees, all
torn apart and bloody.  There is smoke and debris all
around.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing reading
               letter)
          "In a war, there are many moments
          for compassion and tender action.
          There are many moments for ruthless
          action.  What is often called
          ruthless, but may, in many
          circumstances, be only clarity.
          Seeing clearly what there is to be
          done, and doing it directly,
          quickly, awake.

They come upon a burning helicopter, which has crashed in
one of the trees on the shore.  This explains the dead
American bodies.  The Chief picks up the radio phone,
calling to headquarters.

                      CHIEF (OVER TAPE)
          Request-dust off.  Three, maybe
          four KIAs.

          "I will trust you tell your mother
          what you choose about this letter.
          As for the charges against me, I
          am unconcerned.  I am beyond their

EXT. RIVER OUTPOST - DAY

It is a tremendous, tropical rainfall.  The PBR pulls in
toward an American outpost that is being used as a forward
medical evacuation center.  Various helicopter pads are
seen but only one helicopter-the one painted with the
Playboy bunny logo that brought the girls to Hau Phat.
The whole area is a mess with mud and debris and looks
deserted.

          the radio.

                      WILLARD
          What a dump.

Several soldiers in raincoats come out from a tent as the
PBR pulls up.

                      SOLDIER
          Hi there!

                      WILLARD
          How you doing?

                      SOLDIER
          That's a nice little boat you got
          there.  Never seen one up here
          before.

                      CHIEF
          We called in a request for a
          medevac.  You guys didn't receive
          it?

                      SOLDIER
          Medevac?  No.

                      CHIEF
          We passed a downed Huey with some

          Yeah.

The soldier looks at him as though he must be crazy.

                      SOLDIER
          Yeah, right, you'll be back.

They return to the tent.  Willard steps off the PBR.

          Chief?

          See what you can do with that
          engine.  I'm gonna have a look
          around.  And don't leave without
          me.

He walks up the muddy bank and through the deserted camp.
Half of it is blown down.  The whole installation has the
look of a ghost town.  TWO SOLDIERS approach, huddled in
their ponchos.

          Don't ask me, man.

Willard wanders around the desolate place.  Other soldiers
pass.

                      WILLARD
          Hey, guys, where's your C.O.?

                      SOLDIER
          He stepped on a land mine about
          two months ago.  Got all blown to
          hell.

                      WILLARD
          Who's in charge here?

                      SOLDIER
          Charge?  I don't know man.  I'm
          just the night man.  Just doing
          what I'm told.  I'm just a working
          girl.

He just giggles and turns off walking into the mud and
rain.

                      WILLARD
               (to other soldier)
          What about you, fella?

The other soldier turns around smiling idiotically, and
making animal noises.  He stumbles off after his friend.

EXT. PBR - BY THE RIVER - DAY

Lance, Chef, and Clean are sitting on the dock surrounded
by enormous pile of clothes, boots, all sorts of brand new
junk, seemingly abandoned.  Chief remains with the boat.
Clean is working on Lance's M16.

                      CLEAN
          Lance, man, I'm telling you it's
          gonna jam.  You mark my words.

                      LANCE
          Get off my back!

Lance, in an unexplainable fit of temper, turns to Clean,
jumping on him and pulling him into the mud.  Chef, seeing
a brawl, jumps into it as well.  All wrestle in the mud.

BACK TO WILLARD

He hears a voice.

                      AGENT
          Hey, you!  Come here!

Willard turns to see the Hollywood agent from the Hau Phat
show under the flap of a large tent, hiding from the rain,
waving Willard to come over.

His clothes are the same he wore at the Hau Phat show but
wet and dirty.  He motions Willard over to him.

                      AGENT
          Come here.  Is that your boat?
          Come on inside.

                      WILLARD
          What do you want?

                      AGENT
          Come on inside, I want to talk to
          you.  Come on.  Get out of the
          rain.

BACK TO THE CREW IN THE MUD

Rolling around fighting, slapping mud on each other.  It's
as though there is a lingering madness that infects anyone
who visits this place.

                      CHIEF
          Come on, cut the shit.  Come on.

BACK TO WILLARD AND THE AGENT

                      AGENT
          How you doing, Captain?  I want
          you to meet some people.

                                                  CUT TO:

CREW AT THE PBR, STILL FIGHTING IN THE MUD

Willard approaches the group.  He looks down at them as
they sprawl in the mud.

                      WILLARD
          Hey, guys.  Hey, fellas.  Guys?

They don't respond, but continue their wild free-for-all
in the junk and mud.

                      WILLARD
          I just made a deal with people
          from Hau Phat.  I negotiated two
          barrels of fuel for a couple of
          hours with the bunnies.

They stop fighting instantly.  Willard walks toward the
boat.  The group of them run after him.

                      CHEF
          You shittin' me?

                      WILLARD
          No, I'm not.
               (to crew)
          Grab a couple of barrels and get
          up to that big tent.  Come on!

VIEW ON THE CHIEF

He is not jubilant about this news.

                      CHIEF
          Captain.  You're giving away fuel
          for a Playmate of the month?

                      WILLARD
          No.  Playmate of the Year, Chief.
               (he takes a drink
               from a bottle)

                      CHIEF
          Captain, we get in a fire fight
          and run out of fuel, I want you to
          tell me how she was.

                      WILLARD
          I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
          How about you?

                      CHIEF
          You got some mamas in there?

                      WILLARD
          Some what?

                      CHIEF
               (laughing)
          Forget it, Captain.  I'll stay
          with the boat.

Chief moves to the engine, with Lance's M16.

                      LANCE
          Hey, Captain, give me a hand!

Willard helps Lance with the fuel drum, and they exit,
leaving Chief alone on the boat.

EXT. PLAYBOY HELICOPTER - RAIN - DAY

It is still raining.  The PLAYBOY HELICOPTER is parked by
the river.  Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, and we can make out two
figures in the front seat.

                      CHEF (O.S.)
          You know, I got every one of your
          pictures...

INT. PLAYBOY HELICOPTER - RAIN - DAY

It is Chef and Terri.  He has on his rain gear and is
struggling to get it off.  Terri is holding a white BIRD
in her hands and there are TWO MORE perched on their back
seat.

                      CHEF
          I got the centerfold, the Playmate's
          Review, the Playmate of the Year
          runoff.  I even got the calendar.
          Hey, oiseau!  How come you got a
          bird?

                      TERRI
          I used to be the bird girl at Busch
          Gardens.

                      CHEF
          Busch Gardens?

                      TERRI
          Yeah, I used to train birds there.

He reacts as he rises, struggling to get off his rain pants.

                      CHEF
          You are Miss December, aren't you?

                      TERRI
          Miss May.

EXT. HOSPITAL UNIT - RAIN - DAY

Lance and Carrie are inside one of the hospital musk units.
She is lying back on one of the beds, and Lance is trying
to pull her boots off.  Carrie's portfolio and pictures
are spread around the bed with some of her fan mail.

                      CARRIE
          Is it coming?

BACK TO CHEF AND CARRIE

                      CHEF
          Miss December has black hair.

                      TERRI
          It's over there.

She points to the back-seat of the Huey, to a black wig on
a stand.  Chef reacts as he looks at it.  She is still
preoccupied with the bird.

                      TERRI
          He's not one of my regular birds.
               (to bird)
          Come on, baby.  Snatch your cracker.
          Come here.

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

Lance is kneeling next to Carrie, starting to make his
move.  He opens her blouse, exposing her breasts.

                      CARRIE
          Being Playmate of the Year is the
          loneliest experience I can imagine.
          It's like you try to express your
          feelings to someone, and show them
          your heart...

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

                      CHEF
          Yeah, I'd love to see your bird
          act, but would you mind just putting
          this-would you just mind putting
          this wig on for me, please?

He picks up the wig from the stand.  Terri turns and moves
back to the rear seat.

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

He moves to her makeup case.

                      CARRIE
          ...and there's this glass wall
          between you, this invisible glass,
          and they can see your mouth moving.

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

She is seated next to him in the back-seat of the
helicopter.  He puts the black wig on her.

                      TERRI
          I used to train birds for at least
          two years at Busch Gardens.

                      CHEF
          This was cascading over your
          shoulder.
               (her blouse)
          This was open here.

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

Lance is putting barrettes in her hair.

                      CARRIE
          ...but they can't hear what you're
          saying.

BACK TO TERRI AND CHEF

He has opened her blouse and is trying to position her.

                      TERRI
          ...I used to train then to stand
          on their head, fly upside down,
          and ride little bicycles...

                      CHEF
          Your right hand was over there...

Suddenly Clean appears at the back window of the helicopter,
carrying an open black umbrella to shield himself from the
rain.  He bangs on the window.

                      CLEAN
          Hey, Chef!

                      CHEF
          Get out of there, man!

Clean continues to pound on the side of the helicopter.
Chef reacts on the inside.

                      CHEF
          Later!  Later!  Give me fifteen
          minutes.

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

Lance puts some of the green makeup on Carrie.

                      CARRIE
          You can never really make them
          hear what you're trying to say...

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

Trying to position her.

                      CHEF
          You were kind of bending.  Yeah,
          your ass was just kind of...

By this time Clean has climbed up on the roof of the
helicopter, he leans over and looks in at Chef and Terri
through the front window, banging on it with his umbrella.

                      CHEF
          Hey man, fuck off!  Fifteen minutes!

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

He is lying her back on the bed.

                      CARRIE
          That's why I tried so desperately
          to show somebody that I had some
          talent.

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

Chef fixes her shirt.

                      TERRI
          Little baby Macaws.  Have you ever
          seen a baby Macaw?  They're
          beautiful.

Clean is now looking in through the window of the door.
They react to him.

                      CHEF
               (to Clean)
          Come on, man, take off!

                      CLEAN
          I got my rights, man!

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

He puts more makeup on her, as she continues to talk.

                      CARRIE
          They make you do things that you
          don't want to do.  Like this picture
          here.

She opens the portfolio that she has been hanging on to.
We SEE a picture of her in the nude.  Lance looks at it
and reacts.  Then she resumes talking.

                      CARRIE
          I started feeling repulsed with
          myself...

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

                      CHEF
          You were just kind of bending
          forward, you ass kind of out.

                      TERRI
          I love training birds...

                      CHEF
          That's it.

                      TERRI
          ...I really do.

Chef finally has her posed perfectly.

                      CHEF
          That's it!  Viola!  Beautiful.

We realize that he was trying to get her to pose exactly
as she was in the centerfold of the Playmate of the Year
he taped up on the PBR.

                      CHEF
          You know, I can't believe it.  Me,
          J. Hicks.  I can't believe I'm
          really here, you know.

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

He is caressing her face.

                      CARRIE
          ...Maybe I'm unfit to have a
          relationship with a beautiful,
          innocent boy.

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

                      CHEF
          Just think, if it hadn't been for
          the Vietnam War, I'd never would've
          met you, Miss December.

                      TERRI
          Miss May.

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

                      CARRIE
          I wish I could find just one person
          that could share my point of view.

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

They look at each other for a beat, then they both come
unglued.  He starts stripping the clothes off her, laying
her back on the seat, kissing her breasts, etc.

                      TERRI
          You kiss like a bird!  Oh, God!
          Kiss me!

                      CHEF
          I love birds!

BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

Clean appears at the window.  He looks in at them.  Carrie
turns and sees him, she jumps from the bed, panicked, and
moves over by a couple of metal COFFIN containers.  Clean
bursts into the room as Carrie knocks one of the coffins
over.  The lid pops open, revealing a NAKED DEAD SOLDIER
inside, full of bullet holes.  Carrie screams.

BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

Making passionate, enthusiastic love.

                      TERRI
          Like a bird!  Take me like a bird!
          Fly baby!  What are you doing?

                      CHEF
          I can fly like an eagle!

                      TERRI
          Like an eagle, baby!  Cock it to
          me!  Oh, you drive me crazy!

BACK TO CARRIE, LANCE AND CLEAN

Clean is gone.  Lance is sitting next to Carrie, comforting
her.  She is still distraught over seeing the dead body.

                      CARRIE
          Lance, that was somebody's
          son...Lance, there were things
          that they made me do, that I didn't
          want to do.  But they said, "Pull
          the ribbons between your legs,"
          and I didn't want to do it.  But
          they said that was what was expected
          of me, that what people wanted to
          see.

Lance reacts, then kisses her.  He starts taking off her
blouse.  Clean appears at the broken window behind them.
He sticks his head in and looks down at them, watching,
waiting for his turn.  Carrie breaks the embrace and looks
up at Clean.

                      CARRIE
          Who are you?

                      CLEAN
          I'm next, ma'am.

Carrie reacts as we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

The crew are all on the PBR.  Clean is at the back
attempting to shave.  Chef is sitting in back busy cooking
up one of his specialties on top of the engine, giving
Clean a hard time about the girls.  The Chief is at the
helm, a little sore at what's happening to his crew.

                      CHEF
               (to Clean)
          Well, I didn't know you never got
          no pussy!

                      CLEAN
          Shut the fuck up!

                      CHEF
          Sure sorry about that.  If I had
          known, I would have taken you to
          New Orleans.  Teach you some of
          the moves.

                      CHIEF
          Lay off, Chef!

Willard studies the shadowy photo of Kurtz we saw earlier,
as Chef teases Clean in the background.

                      CHEF
          Cherry boy, Cherry boy.

                      CLEAN
          You're fucking dumb!

                      CHEF
          We'll go to New Orleans.  I'll get
          you fixed up, you prick.

                      CHIEF
          Lay off, Chef.

                      CLEAN
          You're the only prick I see around
          here.  If I wanna play with a prick,
          I'll play with my own.

                      CHEF
          You wouldn't know what to do with
          it!

VIEW ON LANCE

Ignoring all this.  He is painting his face with brown and
green camouflage greasepaint.  It is quite ornate-almost
psychedelic.  He holds a compact in his hand.

                      CHIEF
          Chef, I said lay off!  Knock it
          off!  Give him a break!  What do
          you think I said?  And give your
          jaws a rest.  And this ain't the
          army!  You are a sailor.  So get
          out of that frizzly army-looking
          shirt and stop smoking that dope,
          you hear me?

He looks back to Lance.

                      CHIEF
          Lance, what's with all the green
          paint?

                      LANCE
          Camouflage.

                      CHIEF
          How's that?

                      LANCE
          So they can't see you.  They're
          everywhere.  Chief.

The Chief reacts...what the hell can he say.

                      CHIEF
          Uh-huh.  I want you to stay awake
          up there, man.  You got a job to
          do.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE PBR - DAY

The Chief steers the PBR up river and around a bend.  He
sees something ahead, shouts to the crew.

                      CHIEF
          Sampan off the port bow.  Sampan
          off the port bow.  Let's take a
          look.

POV VIEW

A SAMPAN, heading down-river, riding low in the water.

BACK TO PBR CREW

Everybody on the crew has reacted, as the Chief continues
to bark orders.

                      CHIEF
          Lance, bring them in.  Clean, on
          the 60.  Chef, get a 16.  Clean,
          get on that 60!

Lance jumps up from his hammock, grabs his M16. Clean shuts
off his radio, jumps up and moves to the M60 machine gun.

By this time Willard has moved up next to the Chief,
wondering what the hell is going on.

                      WILLARD
          What's up, Chief?

                      CHIEF
          A junk boat, Captain.  We're gonna
          take a routine check.

                      WILLARD
          Let's forget routine now, and let
          them go.

                      CHIEF
          These boats are running supplies
          in this delta, Captain.  I'm gonna
          take a look.

                      WILLARD
          Chief, my mission's got priority
          here.  Hell, you wouldn't even be
          in this part of the river, if it
          wasn't for me.

                      CHIEF
          Until we reach your destination,
          Captain, you're just on for the
          ride.

Willard realizes that this is a ploy by the Chief to
establish his authority.  Nothing is going to stop him.

ANOTHER ANGLE-TO INCLUDE SAMPAN AND PBR

The PBR slides alongside the sampan.  THREE NERVOUS
VIETNAMESE MEN and ONE YOUNG WOMAN look up from the baskets
of rice, mangoes, fish, etc.

                      CHIEF
          All right, come on, let's bring it
          over.  Look in that forward hooch.
          Bring the people out of there.

By this time the third man has crossed forward and joined
the others.

                      CHEF
          Hurry up, motherfuckers!  Move it!
          Can couc!

They hand their ID cards to Chef.

                      CHIEF
          Keep your eyes open, Clean.

                      CLEAN
               (on the machine gun)
          I got you Chief.

Willard just sits down, resigned to this show of the Chief's
authority.

Chef looks at them and nods his approval.  He hands them
to Chief.

                      CHIEF
          Board it and search it.

                      CHEF
          There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

                      CHIEF
          Board it and search it.

                      CHEF
          Just baskets and ducks.  Bananas.
          There ain't nothing on it.

                      CHIEF
          Go on it and search it.

                      CHEF
          Just a goat.  Some fish.  Bunch of
          fucking vegetables.

The Chief finally gets pissed off, he turns and screams at
Chef:

                      CHIEF
          Get on that boat!

                      CHEF
          There's nothing on it, man!

                      CHIEF
          Get on that boat!

Chef starts down into the Vietnamese sampan.  He is really
pissed off.  He shoves the Vietnamese men out of the way.

                      CHEF
               (to man)
          Move it, asshole.

The Chief watches as Chef goes through the routine of
examining the sampan and what it carries.  He is very
nervous as he looks in all the baskets.

                      CHEF
          Pigs!  Mangoes!  What's in the
          rice bag?  Fucking rice!

                      CHIEF
          Well, look in there, Chef!

                      CHEF
          Fucking fish!  More coconuts.
          Rice.  Here's rice.

                      CHIEF
          What's in that vegetable basket?

Chef moves deeper into the sampan.  He looks at the
Vietnamese girl that is sitting on a yellow can.

                      CHEF
               (to girl)
          Can couc!  Come on!  Get out of
          there.

He grabs her and finally pulls her out of the interior of
the cabin.  He moves it and starts looking around.

                      CHIEF
          Check that vegetable basket.

                      CHEF
          All right!

One of the Vietnamese men starts to protest.

                      CLEAN
          Shut up, slope!

                      CHEF
          There ain't nothing in here.

                      CHIEF
          What's in the boxes?  Look in that
          tin can.  That rusty can.

                      CHEF
          Just fucking rice, that's all!
          There ain't nothing in it!

                      CHIEF
          Check that yellow can.  She was
          sitting on it.  What's in it?

Chef starts for it.  All of a sudden, the girl moves.
Clean opens up with the M60. She is blown apart, falling
back on the deck.

In an instant, THEY ALL OPEN FIRE.  One of the Vietnamese
men is blown apart into the water, and the others are gunned
down in their tracks.

All of them continue to fire their rifles and guns wildly,
yelling obscenities.  Willard has his .45 out but does not
shoot.

                      CLEAN
          Motherfuckers!

                      CHEF
               (weeping)
          Let's kill them all!

                      LANCE
          Fucking cocksucker motherfuckers!

Finally the Chief calls out to them.

                      CHIEF
          Hold it!  Hold it!

They all stop firing, but Chef, Lance, and Clean are
mumbling hysterically.

                      CHEF
          Let's kill all the assholes!

                      CHIEF
          Chef, hold it!  Hold it!

                      CHEF
               (hysterically)
          ...why not?

                      CHIEF
          Clean?

                      CLEAN
          I'm good.

                      CHIEF
          You okay, Lance?

                      LANCE
          Shit!  Fuck!

                      CHIEF
          Chef?

Chef has moved to the yellow can that the Vietnamese girl
was sitting on.  He opens the lid and checks what she had
hidden.

                      CHEF
          Look what she was hiding.  She
          what she was running for?

He reaches inside of the can, and pulls out a PUPPY.  They
all react.

                      CHEF
          A fucking puppy!  A puppy.

                      LANCE
          Gimme that dog!  Gimme that dog!

                      CHEF
          No, you're not gonna get it!

                      LANCE
          Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

Lance grabs the dog from him, kicking Chef back.  Chef
throws a mango at him.

                      CHEF
          Fuck you!  Fucking mango, too!
          You want that?

The Vietnamese girl, still alive and bleeding, moves behind
Chef.

                      CHIEF
          Chef, she's moving behind you.
          She's alive.  Check her out.

Chef turns and bends down to her.

                      CHEF
          Come on, Clean, goddamnit, give me
          a hand!

Clean jumps down into the sampan.  He and Chef pick up the
girl and carry her to the edge of the boat.

                      CHEF
          She's not dead.  She's moving.
               (to group)
          Let's take it easy.  Take it easy.
          Slow down and take it easy.

                      CLEAN
          Bring her up.

                      CHIEF
          Is she breathing, Chef?

                      CHEF
          She's hurt.  She's bleeding.

                      CHIEF
          Bring her onboard.  We're taking
          her to an ARVN.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON TO INCLUDE WILLARD

Willard looks at the girl and then to Chief.

                      WILLARD
          What are you talking about?

                      CHIEF
          We're taking her to some friendlies.
          She's wounded, she's not dead.

Willard hold his .45.  Looks down at Chef nd the girl.

                      WILLARD
          Get out of there, Chef.

                      CHIEF
          The book says, Captain-

Before anybody can react, Willard aims and SHOOTS THE GIRL
DEAD with his .45.  She falls dead in Chef's arms.

                      CHEF
          Fuck you.  Fuck them.

Willard turns and looks at the Chief.

                      WILLARD
          I told you not to stop.  Now let's
          go.

                                                FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. THE RIVER - PBR - EVENING

The boat moves up the river.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          It was a way we had over here of
          living with ourselves.  We'd cut
          them in half with a machine gun,
          and give them a Band-Aid.  It was
          a lie.  And the more I saw of them,
          the more I hated liars.  Those
          boys were never gonna look at me
          the same way again, but I felt
          like I knew one or two things about
          Kurtz, that weren't in the dossier.

EXT. DO LUNG BRIDGE - THE PBR - RIVER - NIGHT

The boat edges in toward a wrecked bridge in the distance.
Along the banks are sandbagged fortifications with the
U.S. soldiers.  There is a bright fire burning uncontrolled
in the distance-in fact there are several-flame and sparks
from welding on the bridge momentarily light up the night.
There is sporadic gunfire at O.S. snipers, and flares arc
through the sky above the bridge.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Do Lung bridge was the last army
          outpost on the Nung River.  Beyond
          it there was only Kurtz.

ANGLE FORWARD - LANCE AND CHEF

                      CHEF
          Hey, Lance, what do you think?

                      LANCE
          It's beautiful.

                      CHEF
          What's the matter with you?  You're
          acting kind of weird?

                      LANCE
          You know that last tab of acid I
          was saving?

                      CHEF
          Yeah.

                      LANCE
          I dropped it.

                      CHEF
          You dropped acid?  Far out.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Chief powers the boat forward, as Willard and Clean
watch in awe.

Everywhere are wrecked boats, parts of jeeps sticking out
of the water-a smashed helicopter on the banks.  The bridge
is in a state of siege.  Mortars and rockets arc through
the night indiscriminately and rip through the nearby
jungle.  Light automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEAD occasionally.
The entire scene is lit by Parachute flares.

As the PBR edges forward, SOLDIERS run up through the water,
trying to get aboard.  One soldier is carrying some luggage
and an M16. He splashes into the water, in a mad dash for
freedom.

                      SOLDIER
          Take me home!  Goddamn you!

                      CHIEF
          Get away from this boat.

                      SOLDIER #2
          You'll get what you deserve!

He and the others are left behind as the PBR continues
forward.  Willard sees a young LIEUTENANT kneeling on a
platform that juts out into the water.  He is holding a
small strobe light, trying to signal the PBR down.  He is
holding a large mail bag and a pouch in the other hand.

Willard motions toward the shore.  The Chief turns the
boat towards the Lieutenant.

                      CARLSON
          Is there a Captain Willard on board?
          Captain Willard?

                      WILLARD
          Yeah!  Who's that?

As the boat crosses to a stop, Lance swings the spotlight
onto the Lieutenant.

                      CARLSON
          Lieutenant Carlson, sir.
               (to Lance)
          Get that light off me!

Lance swings the light off him, as Willard squats down on
the bow of the boat.

                      CARLSON
          I was sent here from Nah Trang
          with these three days ago, sir.
          Expected you here a little sooner.

He hands Willard a plastic bag with maximum security
markings.  Willard takes it-also a mail pouch.

                      CARLSON
          This is mail for the boat.  You
          don't know how happy this makes
          me, sir.

                      WILLARD
          Why?

                      CARLSON
          Now I can get out of here, if I
          can find a way.

He turns and splashes off into the darkness.  Then stops
and looks back.

                      CARLSON
          You're in the asshole of the world,
          Captain!

He salutes, then turns and moves away.  Willard hops off
the side of the boat into the mud, moving up toward the
shore.

                      CHIEF
          Captain, where you going?

                      WILLARD
          To see if I can find some fuel and
          get some information.  Pick me up
          on the other side of the bridge.

                      CHIEF
               (to his men)
          Somebody go with him.
               (to Chef)
          Chef.

Chef doesn't move, not wanting to go.  No one budges, then
Lance volunteers.

                      LANCE
          I'll go.  I want to go.

He picks up the puppy and an M16, then jumps over the side
onto the shore.

EXT. SHORE - NIGHT

As Willard and Lance walk across an open area, they are
lit by the battle in the background.  Lance looks up and
around the embankment and along a barbed wire on the edge
of the road.  SHELLS SCREAM overhead.  Lance just stands
looking down on the phantasmagoric strings of lights, the
smoke, the fires.

Willard jumps down into a trench.  We SEE a SOLDIER
crouched, holding his buddy, who is  crying uncontrollably.

                      WILLARD
          Where can I find the C.O.?

                      SOLDIER
          You can right to it, son of a bitch!

                      WILLARD
          Lance!  Get down here!

Lance is still reacting to the pyrotechnics around him.
He turns and jumps down into the trench.

                      WILLARD
          You still got a commanding officer
          her?

                      SOLDIER
          Beverly Hills.

                      WILLARD
          What?

                      SOLDIER
          Right up the road there's a concrete
          bunker called Beverly Hills.  Where
          the fuck else do you think it would
          be?

Willard turns and moves away from the two soldiers.  Lance
follows.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they proceed down the long
trench.  They pass a group of black G.I.s. Suddenly Willard
trips over a body, and falls right into a mud puddle.  The
body stirs.

                      SOLDIER
          You stepped in my face!

                      LANCE
          We thought you were dead.

                      SOLDIER
          Well, you thought wrong, damnit!

They come to another gun emplacement, where two BACK
SOLDIERS are at a fifty-caliber machine gun.  The GUNNERS
blast away into the night, walking and swearing at Vietcong.
The SPOTTER is feeding the bullets into the gun.
Psychedelic guitar music plays on a portable radio.

                      GUNNER
               (to enemy)
          I told you to stop fucking with
          me!  You think you're so bad, huh,
          nigga?

Willard watches for a while, then shouts over to him.

                      WILLARD
          What are you shooting at, soldier?

                      GUNNER
          Gooks!  What the fuck do you think
          I'm shooting at?
               (turns and sees
               it's an officer)
          I'm sorry, sir.  There are gooks
          out there by the wire.  But I think
          I killed them all.

                      SPOTTER
          You ain't shot shit!  Listen!

The enemy's yelling continues.

                      GUNNER
          Oh, shit, he's trying to call his
          friends.  Sen up a flare.

The spotter reaches over and picks up a flare pistol, and
fires a FLARE into the air.  The gunner starts blasting
away again,

                      GUNNER
          You think you so bad, nigga?  You
          think you so bad?

He stops firing.  The yelling continues.

                      SPOTTER
          They're all dead, stupid.  There's
          one still alive underneath them
          bodies.

                      WILLARD
          Who's the commanding officer here?

                      GUNNER
          Ain't you?
               (to enemy)
          You think you so bad?  I got
          something for your ass!  I got
          something for you now!

Lance climbs up on top of the sandbags with the puppy and
looks at the pyrotechnics.  Explosions go off all around
him...space city.

                      SPOTTER
          There's nothing but bodies, man!

                      GUNNER
               (to spotter)
          Go get the Roach, man.  Go get the
          Roach, nigga!

The spotter moves down the trench, to where a tall lanky
black soldier wearing all sorts of beads and trinkets leans
against the ditch, sleeping.

                      SPOTTER
               (calling out)
          Roach!  Roach!

THE ROACH gets up somewhat annoyed, but very cool, and
saunters up toward the machine gun.  Willard looks over
and sees Lance up on top of the sandbags.

                      WILLARD
          Lance!

Lance climbs down back into the trench.  The Roach and
spotter move back to the machine gun, where the gunner
waits.  The Roach turns off the radio, sits down, and
listens.

                      SPOTTER
          Do you hear them?  Well, bust them!

                      VIETCONG (O.S.)
          Hey, G.I., fuck you!

                      GUNNER
          You hear him out there on the wire,
          man?

                      ROACH
          Yeah.

                      VIETCONG (O.S.)
          Fuck you, you G.I.

                      GUNNER
          You need a flare?

                      ROACH
          No.
               (listens)
          He's close, man.  He's real close.

                      VIETCONG (O.S.)
          G.I., fuck you!

The Roach opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon,
plunks a big slug into it.  He snaps it closed, then turns
and wraps the strap around his arm.  He points the weapon
up into the air listens to the YELLING, calculating, then
fires.  The grenade whistles off into the night.  There is
a sharp EXPLOSION that cuts off the scream.  Then the thud
of bodies.

                      ROACH
          Motherfucker.

                      WILLARD
          Hey, soldier.  Do you know who's
          in command here?

                      ROACH
          Yeah.

He turns and walks away.

FULL SHOT - PBR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The PBR stands in the shadows.  Chef, the Chief, and Clean
are waiting for Willard and Lance.  SHELLS WHISTLE BY and
CRASH in the distance as the welding continues on the
bridge.

Clean looks up and sees a direct hit on the bridge.  TWO
SOLDIERS ate blown off some of the towers and into the
water.

                      CLEAN
          Holy shit!  Yo, Chief, two guys
          just got blown off that bridge,

                      CHIEF
          You hand on, man.  You're gonna be
          okay.

Clean turns and moves to the bow, where Chef is kneeling
by the mail bag.

                      CLEAN
          What's that?

                      CHEF
          Mail, man!

                      CHIEF
          Later on the mail!  Watch them
          trees.

Willard and Lance climb back onto the boat, loaded down
with supplies.  They move down into the PBR.

                      WILLARD
          There's no diesel fuel, but I picked
          up some ammo.  Let's move out.

                      CHIEF
          Did you find the C.O., Captain?

                      WILLARD
          There's no fucking C.O. here.
          Let's just get going.

                      CHIEF
          Which way, Captain?

                      WILLARD
          You know which way, Chief.

He takes off his shirt, then his T-shirt.

                      CHEF
          You're on your own, Captain.  Still
          want to go on?  Like this bridge.
          We build it every night, Charlie
          blows it right back up again, just
          so the generals can say the road's
          open.  Think about it...who cares?

                      WILLARD
          Just get us up river!

                      CHIEF
          Chef.  On the bow.
               (to Clean)
          Stand by, Clean.

FULL VIEW - THE PBR - NIGHT

The men on the bridge continue to weld with their torches
as the PBR backs up, then the Chief pulls away from the
bridge.  They all look back in the distance, the hills
flash with charges, there is a fiery glow, the concussion
of heavy explosions, as the BRIDGE BLOWS.

EXT. THE PBR - DAY

It is the next morning.  The PBR continues on its journey
up river.  Chef distributes mail from the mail bag.

                      CHEF
          Shit, you got another one, Clean!

                      CLEAN

Willard has opened the Top Secret pouch and is reading the
letter inside:

               (reading)
          "There has been a new development
          regarding your mission, which we
          must one communicate to you.  Months
          ago, a man was ordered on a mission,
          which was identical to yours.  We
          have reason to believe that he is
          now operating with Colonel Kurtz.
          Saigon was carrying him MIA for
          his family's sake, but they assumed
          he was dead.  Then they intercepted

Lance has taken some SMOKE BOMBS and is popping them open.
COLORED SMOKE begins to pour out.

SUDDENLY streams of TRACERS whip out of the jungle at them,
other bullets smash and ricochet off the deck; glass
shatters, everybody jumps to their battle stations.

Lance jumps into the turret of the twin fifties and starts
blasting away at the jungle.  The Chief tries to power the
PBR out of the ambush.  Clean jumps up behind the M60
machine gun and starts firing.  Willard uses his M16.

Everything is confusion, yelling, gunfire, the thud of
bullets ripping into the PBR fiberglass hull.  Lance's
guns return fire.  He screams obscenities as he vents an
almost superhuman violence.

MED.  CLOSE SHOT - LANCE - FIRING HIS GUNS

Turning in the turret; bullets smash and explode around
him.  Nobody quite knows where the fire is coming from.

VIEW ON THE CHIEF

The Chief steers and accelerates erratically, trying to
dodge the fire fight.

VIEW ON CLEAN FIRING HIS GUN

Firing the M60...suddenly it jams.  As he rises up behind
the shield he is riddled by machine gun fire.  The bullets
blast into his throat, chest, stomach...he falls to the
deck.

Nobody has seen that he is down yet.  They keep firing
their guns into the jungle.  The Chief throttles forward,
the boat surges ahead and slams across the river.  It is
all over quickly.

The Chief turns and sees that Clean has been hit and is
down on the deck.

                      CHIEF
          Chef!  Take care of Clean!  Captain,
          Clean's hit!  He's hit!

Clean lying dead, flat on his back.  Chief turns him over

EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

The boat under power, moving through fog.  They pass downed
jets, wreckage, burning fires.  Willard is sitting on the
bow, looking out into the distance as though he sees
something.

                      WILLARD
               (motions to Chief)
          Hold on.  Throw me the glasses.

He looks through the binoculars.

WILLARD'S P.O.V. - WRECKED FRENCH PLANTATION - DAY

In the distance, we can make out a PLANTATION.  The dock
has been devastated by years of fighting.  There is a heavy
FOG or MIST everywhere.  Up on the hill above the dock
sits a large house; it does not look heavily damaged.

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

Willard picks up his M16 and moves to the front of the
boat.  Chief has also seen the wrecked plantation.

                      CHIEF
          Lance.  Get the 16 on the bow.
               (to Chef)
          Chef, on the 60.

The Chief pulls the PBR slowly up to the wrecked dock.
Willard jumps off with his M16 in hand and cautiously looks
around.

He walks into a wrecked barn.  He comes out of the side
and makes his way back to Chef and Lance, who are standing
on the dock.

                      CHIEF
          Lance, cover the Captain.

Suddenly from out of the fog...FRENCH VOICES shout out.

                      LAFAVRE
          You are surrounded.  Return.  Drop
          your weapons.

                      CHEF
               (in French)
          Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!
               (to Lance and others)
          They're French.
               (n French, to
               soldiers)
          I am dropping my weapon!

Chef and Lance start to put down their M16s, the Chief
shouts out furiously from the boat.

                      CHIEF
          Chef!  Pick up that weapon!  Pick
          it up!  Stand fast!

Chef continues to shout to the French.

                      CHEF
          We are Americans!  We are friends.

                      LAFAVRE
          Drop your weapons!

As Willard walks down the dock, French soldiers appear out
of the fog, totally surrounding them.  Willard stops in
front of them, realizing there is no way out, and raises
his rifle in surrender .

                      CHIEF
               (to Lance and Chef)
          All right, you men.  Put down your
          weapons.

They all drop their weapons.  More soldiers step out.

                      CHEF
               (in French)
          We are Americans.  We are friends.
          We are friends.

We SEE more French and Cambodian soldiers as they step out
of the fog onto the dock.  They move forward cautiously.
It is strange.  It is like meeting up with a group of
soldiers from the French Indo-Chinese War.  It's as though
they've stepped into 1954.  The soldiers are still wearing
parts of the red berets of their particular unit that fought
against the Viet Minh.  There are also Vietnamese who serve
the French and who fought with the French.  They all bear
older automatic weapons and suspicion in their eyes.

Another Frenchman joins the group.  This is obviously the
patriarch of the family.  HUBERT DEMARAIS is about fifty,
with a dignity and strength about him.  He and Willard
look at each other.

                      WILLARD
          We lost one of our men.

                      DEMARAIS
          We French always pay respect to
          the dead of our allies.  You're
          all welcome.
               (pause)
          Y name is Hubert DeMarais.  This
          is my family's plantation.  It has
          been such for seventy years, and
          it will be such until we are all
          dead.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - DOLLY SHOT - DAY

The group is assembled.  There is a platoon of Cambodian
soldiers standing by an open grave, SERGEANT LAFAVRE in
front of them.

                      LAFAVRE
          To my command!  Attention!  Weapons
          on the shoulder!  Present weapons!

The platoon present their weapons, as Clean's body is
carried toward the grave.  The bugler brings the bugle up
to his lips and plays "Taps."

Willard looks up and sees something on the balcony of the
house.

HIS P.O.V:

A young WOMAN, dressed in white, is on the balcony.  She
has been watching the ceremony.  She turns back into the
house.

The Chief bends down and picks up the tattered American
flag, which is on Clean's body.  Lance places Clean's tape
recorder on the body.  The body is lowered into the grave.

                      CHIEF
               (to Willard)
          Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone
          Miller, on behalf of a grateful
          nation.

He hands the folded flag to Willard.

INT. DINING ROOM - GROUP - NIGHT

We SEE the MeMarais interior.  They have set up a table
for the crew, and with some of their own enlisted men.
The table is headed by Sergeant LaFavre, who is already
seriously into the wine.

A waiter comes to the table and stops next to Chef.  He is
holding a plate full of chicken, etc. Chef's face lights
up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

                      CHEF
          This food is really wonderful,
          isn't it?  The wine, the sauces.
          I can't believe it.  Can I speak
          with the chef?

                      LAFAVRE
          The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

                      CHEF
          No kidding.  He cooks like this
          and he can't even speak French?
               (to Lance)
          Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.

Lance has been loading up on food from the waiter's plate.
As the waiter moves away from him, Lance reaches across
the table for the bread and accidentally knocks over a
glass.

                      CHIEF
          Hey, Lance...

Lance realizes he is eating like an animal, sits back down.

The VIEW MOVES ALONG THE TABLE AND REVEALS that on a higher
level there is a more elaborate table set, where the
DeMarais family is dining with Willard.

Willard is sitting next to DeMarais, who is at the head of
the table.  Christian, ANNE-MARIE, and old blind UNCLE,
Claudine, the TUTOR, and Philippe are all seated, listening
to one of the grandchildren, who is reciting a poem.  The
other grandchildren stand nearby listening.

The child stumbles through the poem.

                      DEMARAIS
               (in French)
          You still need to study with Mr.
          Robert.  Let's go.  Not too bad.
          Go to bed everyone now.

The children kiss their parents good night, and run out of
the room.  DeMarais turns to Willard.

                      DEMARAIS
          This is Baudelaire.  It is a very
          cruel poem for children, but they
          need it, because life sometime is
          very cruel.

He reaches behind him and picks up a plaque, hands it to
Willard.

                      DEMARAIS
          As you can see.  Attack repels by
          the family.

                      PHILIPPE
          Just for this war

                      DEMARAIS
               (pointing to the
               plaque)
          Vietcong, fifty-eight.  North
          Vietnamese, twelve.  South
          Vietnamese, eleven.

                      WILLARD
          Americans, six?

                      DEMARAIS
          Yes, well, there were perhaps
          mistakes.

Willard hands the plaque back to Demarais, who hands if
off to Philippe.

ANOTHER ANGLE TO INCLUDE ROXANNE

The young woman we saw earlier, ROXANNE, has come down the
stairs and moves into the dining Room.  DeMarais looks up
and sees her.

                      DEMARAIS
               (in French)
          Roxanne, you were curious to see
          these Americans, weren't you?

                      ROXANNE
               (in French)
          No, I was only hungry.

She stops in front of an empty chair next to Philippe.
Willard rises to greet her.

                      DEMARAIS
          May I present Captain Willard, he
          is of a Paratroop regiment.  Madame
          Sarrault.

She smiles and indicates for Willard to sit down.

                      ROXANNE
          Captain.

She sits down.  There is an uneasy silence.  She laughs
slightly.

          "An angel passes..."

DeMarais reacts.

                      DEMARAIS
               (in French)
          "...Let's butcher it!"  Do you
          remember this story in Paris, when
          the baron said, "Let's cut the
          angel?"

                      ROXANNE
               (in French)
          I don't think that is the subject
          tonight.

                      DEMARAIS
          I'm sorry, Captain.  It was just a
          little story.  And people starving
          during the war.  They are all around
          the table, and there was a silence,
          somebody say "An angel is passing
          by." So somebody say "Let's eat
          it!"
               (laughs)

                      WILLARD
          How long can you possibly stay
          here?

                      DEMARAIS
          We stay forever.

                      WILLARD
          No, no, I mean, why don't you go
          back home to France?

                      DEMARAIS
          This is our home, Captain.

                      WILLARD
          Sooner or later, you're --

                      DEMARAIS
          No!

Roxanne interrupts, saying something to him in French.  He
silences her.

                      DEMARAIS
               (to Willard)
          You don't understand our mentality!
          The French officer mentality!  At
          first, we lose in Second World
          War.  I don't say that you Americans
          win, but we lose.

                      CLAUDINE
          Oh, Papa.

DeMarais is starting to get heated up.

                      DEMARAIS
          When I speak, you shut up!
               (to Willard)
          In Dine Bien Phu, we lose!  In
          Algeria, we lose!  In Indochina,
          we lose.  But here, we don't lose!
          This piece of earth, we keep it!
          We will never lose it!  Never!

The OLD BLIND UNCLE at the other end of the table speaks,
as Claudine cuts his food for him and feeds him.

                      OLD UNCLE
          And now you take French place, and
          the Viet Minh fight you.  And what
          can you do?  Nothing.  Absolutely
          nothing.

                      DEMARAIS
          The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
          You never know what they think.
          The Russian ones who help them,
          "Come and give us their money, we
          are all Communists.  Chinese, come
          and give us guns.  We're all
          brothers." They hate the Chinese!
          Maybe they hate the American less
          that the Russian and the Chinese.
          If tomorrow the Vietnamese are
          Communists, they will be Vietnamese
          Communists.  And this is something
          that you will never understand,
          you American.

                      OLD UNCLE
          I don't know.  Maybe in the future
          we can make something with the
          Viet Minh.

                      PHILIPPE
          Don't you understand?  The V.C.
          say, "Go away!  Go away!"  That's
          finish for all the white people in
          Indochina.  If you're French,
          American, that's all the same.
          "Go!"  They want to forget you.
          Look, Captain --

He rises from the table.

                      DEMARAIS
          Come on, Philippe.  It's enough
          now.

Philippe goes and picks up an egg from the basket, returns
to the table.

                      PHILIPPE
          Look, this is the truth...

He breaks the egg in his hand, the contents dribble out.

                      PHILIPPE
          An egg, the white leaves, but the
          yellow stays!

He turns and walks away.

                      DEMARAIS
               (in French)
          Come on, stay with us.  What's
          going on?

                      PHILIPPE
               (calling back)
          They don't want to face the truth.

He points to the dining room, turns and exits, LaFavre,
playing his accordion, walks toward the dining room.

                      CHRISTIAN
          When I was in Saigon, I spoke to
          an American politician, and he
          explained it very well.  He said,
          "Look, Yesterday it was Korea,
          today Vietnam, tomorrow Thailand,
          the Philippines, then maybe Europe."

LaFavre enters, playing the accordion.

                      CHRISTIAN
          Come on, why not Europe?  Look
          what happened in Czechoslovakia
          recently.  And even before the
          Second World War, the Americans
          knew exactly what was going on!
          They don't want that shit to take
          over!
               (to LaFavre, who is
               playing the
               accordion)
          LaFavre!  LaFavre, stop it!

                      LAFAVRE
          All you white people are shit.

                      CHRISTIAN
          They are fighting.  Fighting for
          freedom.

                      LAFAVRE
          Freedom?  Bullshit.  French
          bullshit.  American bullshit.
               (to all)
          Dine Bien Phu, that's serious!
          All soldier know they are already
          dead.
               (to Willard)
          You know anything about Dine Bien
          Phu?

                      WILLARD
          Yeah, I know.

                      DEMARAIS
          No, you don't.  Not really.

                      TUTOR
          A milliary mistake.

                      DEMARAIS
          A mistake?  A voluntary mistake!
          Voluntary!

                      LAFAVRE
          All the soldiers knew, we knew we
          would be dead.

                      DEMARAIS
          The generals and the colonels
          believe it's impossible for the
          Viets to get the cannon up there
          in the mountain.  But they do.
          Then they wait for the rain to
          come.  When it comes, no airplane
          can fly there, and our paratroopers
          jump at ninety meters!  I mean,
          you know, ninety meters!  Seventy
          meters!  That's crazy!  Nobody in
          the world can do that!  And they
          only do that to be dead with their
          friends.

LaFavre starts playing "The Star Spangled Banner!

                      DEMARAIS
          The French Army sacrificed.
          Sacrificed by politicians safe at
          home.  They put the army in an
          impossible situation where they
          couldn't win!

                      TUTOR
          You exaggerate.

                      DEMARAIS
          The students are marching in Paris,
          protesting, demonstrating.  They
          stab the soldiers in their back!
          The soldier would open a grenade,
          it wouldn't work.  A piece of paper
          would fall, "Union of the French
          Woman." "We are all for the Viets."
          Traitors!  Communist traitors at
          home!

                      LAFAVRE
          Dine Bien Phu, okay.  The French
          is shit.  No one care.  No one
          want to--

                      CHRISTIAN
          You are bothering me, LaFavre!
               (to Willard)
          Why don't you Americans learn from
          us, from our mistakes?  My God,
          with your army, your strength,
          your power...you could win if you
          wanted to!

As LaFavre leaves, he falls down some steps that lead out
of the dining room.

                      DEMARAIS
               (in French; to
               Christian)
          Be kind and help this poor LaFavre
          who fell, please.

                      CHRISTIAN
               (to Willard)
          You can win!

He rises and goes to help the sergeant.  As they leave,
his wife Anne-Marie sits there nervously, then rises,
excusing herself.

                      OLD UNCLE
          You know, I'm sure we can make
          something here.  I'm sure about
          it, you know?  I never do something
          wrong to the people here.

                      TUTOR
          That's right, but the Communists
          at home have never been traitors.

                      DEMARAIS
          No, never traitors.  For me, Mendes-
          France was a Communist.

                      TUTOR
          Mendes-France was a Socialist.

                      DEMARAIS
          He was Communist!  That's it!

They get into an argument in French.  The others look at
each other, at Willard, as the argument continues.

                      TUTOR
          Socialist.

                      DEMARAIS
          How do you want the government to
          win when it is Communist?

                      TUTOR
          Communists have always worked for
          peace wherever they are.

                      DEMARAIS
          They killed the French Army, which
          was the strongest.  Destroyed
          because of who?  The Communists.

                      TUTOR
          The army damaged itself by its
          attitude toward the people here.

                      DEMARAIS
          And why do you think that it did
          that?  Because it understood it
          had been sacrificed by the Communist
          government.

                      TUTOR
          Socialist.

                      DEMARAIS
          Communist.

                      TUTOR
          Captain, good night.

The tutor gets up and starts to walk out...gives Demarais
one more shot.

                      TUTOR
               (to DeMarais)
          Mendes-France was a Socialist.

He leaves.

                      OLD UNCLE
          We can stay.  I know we can stay.
          You know, we always helped the
          people, we work with the people.

The old man continues babbling, as Claudine helps him up.

                      CLAUDINE
          Come on, we are leaving.

                      OLD UNCLE
          So we can be friends, we are agreed.

The exit, Claudine consoling him.  Now only Roxanne,
Willard, and DeMarais are at the table.

                      DEMARAIS
          See, Captain, when my grandfather
          and my uncle's father came here,
          there was nothing.  Nothing.  The
          Vietnamese were nothing.  So we
          worked hard, very hard, and brought
          the rubber from Brazil, and then
          plant it here.  We took the
          Vietnamese, work with them, make
          something, something out of nothing.
          So when you ask me why we want to
          stay here, Captain, we want to
          stay here because it's ours, it
          belongs to us.  It keeps out family
          together.  We fight for that!
          While you Americans, you are
          fighting for the biggest nothing
          in history.  I'm sorry Captain.  I
          will see if your men needs any
          help to repair your boat, so that
          you can go on with your war.  Good
          night, Roxanne.

He rises from the table and moves out of the room.  Willard
and Roxanne are left alone at the table.

                      ROXANNE
          I apologize for my family, Captain.
          We have all loots much here.  Hubert-
          his wife and two sons.  And I have
          lost a husband.

                      WILLARD
          I understand.

                      ROXANNE
          You are tired of the war.  I can
          see it in your face.  It was the
          same in the eyes of the soldiers
          of our war.  We called them "Les
          Soldat Perdus." The Lost Soldiers
               (a beat)
          If you like we can have some cognac.

She rises and moves to the living room.

                      WILLARD
          No, I have to see about my men
          and...

Roxanne stops at the bottom of the stairs.  She turns to
look at him.

                      ROXANNE
          The war will still be here tomorrow.

                      WILLARD
          Yeah, I guess you're right.

He rises and walks down into the living room.  Roxanne
moves toward a table full of liquor bottles.

                      ROXANNE
          I noticed you had no wine at dinner.

She begins to pour cognac into a glass.

                      WILLARD
          No, I don't drink wine.  I do like
          cognac, but I don't want any now,
          thank you.

                      ROXANNE
          Well, then I must drink alone,.
          Then.

She picks up her glass of cognac, and walks by Willard out
onto the terrace.  Stops and looks back at him.

                      ROXANNE
          Will you go back after the war to
          America?

                      WILLARD
          No.

                      ROXANNE
          Then you're like us, your home is
          here.

She walks farther out onto the terrace, sits down on a
sofa, with her back to the river below.  Willard follows
her and stands next to her at the railing.  We can SEE men
working on the PBR down below at the dock.

                      ROXANNE
          Do you know why you can never step
          into the same river twice?

                      WILLARD
          Yeah.  Because it's always moving.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROXANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Our VIEW starts CLOSE ON Roxanne's hands.  She is holding
a long opium pipe.  In the other hand she holds a long
tamper with some opium on the end.  She handles it expertly
over a small lamp with open flame, heating it, then putting
the bead of opium into the pipe.

                      ROXANNE
          I used to prepare a pipe for my
          husband.  It was morphine he took
          for the wounds he suffered in his
          heart.

She looks over at Willard.  They are both lying on her
bed, next to each other.

                      ROXANNE
          He would rage and he would cry, my
          lost soldier.  And I said to him,
          "There are two of you, don't you
          see?  One that kills and one that
          loves." And he said to me, "I don't
          know whether I am animal or a god."
          But you are both.

She offers him the pipe, he takes it and inhales the smoke
from the opium, gives it back to her.  She smokes also.

                      ROXANNE
          You want more?

He shakes his head.

                      ROXANNE
          All that matters is that you are
          alive.  You are alive, Captain.
          That's the truth.

She gets up from the bed, unties one of the strings of the
bed canopy, and takes off her robe, revealing her naked
body.  She walks around the bed, untying the other strings.
She approaches him.  He reaches up to her.

                      ROXANNE
          There are two of you, don't you
          see?  One that kills...and one
          that loves.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

Mist swells up around the river as the boat moves into an
obscure FOG.  Willard is up front on the bow, trying to
see what's ahead.  The Chief is at the helm.

ED. CLOSE SHOT - THE CHIEF

We catch a glimpse of him, even though we are in the fog,
he can't see a thing.  Finally he shuts down the engine
and they coast.

                      CHIEF
          Can't see nothing.  We're stopping.

Willard jumps up and moves to the Chief.

                      WILLARD
          You're not authorized to stop this
          boat, Chief.

                      CHIEF
          I said I can't see a thing, Captain!
          I'm stopping this boat!  I ain't
          risking no more lives!

                      WILLARD
          I'm in command here, goddamnit.
          You'll do what I say!

                      CHIEF
               (to Chef)
          You see anything, Chef?

Chef is at the back of the boat behind the M50. He searches
the banks.

                      CHEF
          Why don't they fucking attack,
          man?

ANGLE ON  LANCE

His head back, wailing eerily.

                      CHEF
          Watch it over there, Chief.  Got a
          stump.

                      CHIEF
          Lance, on the fifties.

ANGLE ON THE PBR

We catch glimpses through the moving FOG, all of the men
on the PBR, at their guns, searching the shoreline.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          He was close.  He was real close.
          I couldn't see him yet, but I could
          feel him, as if the boat were being
          sucked up river and the water was
          flowing back into the jungle.
          Whatever was going to happen, it
          wasn't going to be the way they
          called it back in Nah Trang.

SUDDENLY the air is filled with arrows, an avalanche of
arrows in the sky.  They come down clattering on the deck.
Chef opens fire.

                      WILLARD
          Arrows!

                      CHIEF
          Fire!  Chef, open fire!  Fire!
          Lance!  Fire!

ANOTHER ANGLE - ARROWS

Arrows everywhere, primitive spears flung expertly.

ANGEL ON LANCE

In the front turret, arrows whiz around him.  He turns,
smiles, picks one up, looks at it, breaks it in half.

ANGLE ON THE CHEF

Frightened, but almost heroic, firing his weapon and
shouting obscenities at the weird, dancing heathens
attacking him.  Arrows fall harmlessly around him.

HIGH ANGLE - THE SKY

Thousands of arrows in the sky come clattering down on the
deck by the Chief.

ANGLE TO GO WITH WILLARD

Amazed...immediately he knows they're harmless, done more
to frighten than to injure.  But still, he's never seen
anything like this in all his time in Vietnam, and he knows
in his gut that it is still another message from Kurtz.
He moves to Chef, tries to make him stop firing.

                      WILLARD
          Chef!  Chef, it's okay!  Quit
          firing!  They're just little arrows.
          Cut it out!  Quiet!  Chief, tell
          them to hold their fire!  They're
          just little sticks!  They're trying
          to scare us!

The Chief picks up his M16 and turns to Willard wildly.

                      CHIEF
          You got us in this mess, and now
          you can't get us out, because you
          don't know where the hell you're
          going, do you?
               (no answer)
          Do you?  You son of a bitch!  You
          bastard!

The Chief leaves the wheel of the PBR and steps up on the
deck with his M16.

                      WILLARD
               (to Lance)
          Lance, get the wheel!

Lance moves to take over the wheel, as Chief starts firing
his M16 madly.

                      CHIEF
          You savages!  Come and get it, you
          son of a bitches!

He drops the M16, moves to the M60 machine gun and starts
firing madly again.

Suddenly the Chief stops short, puzzled, a small droplet
of blood lines his mouth.  He coughs up a mouthful of blood,
then looks down.  The head of a SPEAR has gone through his
chest.  He looks up at Willard.

                      CHIEF
          A spear?

He remains looking directly into Willard's eyes, then starts
to fall.  Willard catches him, and is pulled down to the
deck by the weight of the Chief's body.  The Chief looks
up at him and suddenly reaches his hands for Willard's
throat, trying to pull Willard down on top of the spearhead,
trying to skewer him, and pull him along with him to death.
A beat as they struggle, then suddenly the Chief DIES.

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

Lance is putting camouflage paint on the Chief.

Willard has jumped off the boat with all of his gear.
Chef looks down at him.

                      WILLARD
          My mission is to make it up to
          Cambodia.  There's a Green Beret
          colonel up there who's gone insane,
          and I'm supposed to kill him.

                      CHEF
          That's fucking typical!  Shit!
          Fucking Vietnam mission!  I'm short
          and we gotta go up there so you
          can kill one of our own guys?
          That's fucking great!  That's just
          fucking great, man!  Shit!  That's
          fucking crazy!  I thought you were
          going to blow up a bridge, or some
          fucking railroad tracks, or
          something!

Lance has pulled the Chief's body into the river, and jumped
in himself.  Willard and Chef watches him, as he tries to
bury Chief's body in the water.

Willard turns to leave.

                      WILLARD
          That's all right.

                      CHEF
          No, wait.  We'll go together.  On
          the boat.  We'll go with you.
          We'll go out there.  But on the
          boat, okay?

Lance gently floats Chief off downstream.  We SEE the
Chief's body slowly disappear.

EXT. RIVER - PBR - NIGHT

The PBR moves up-river.  The shore is lit up with burning
torches and a large wooden structure in flames.  We SEE
the faces of the remaining crew, as they take in this sight.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

The boat passes rows of skulls, flaming torches, men impaled
on poles, etc.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Part of me was afraid of what I
          would find, and what I would do
          when I got there.  I knew the risks.
          Or imagined I knew.  But the thing
          I felt the most, much stringer
          than fear, was the desire to
          confront him.

Lance is at the back of the boat, moving in a slow-motion
Tai Chi.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

The PBR is slowly moving TOWARD CAMERA.  Lance and Willard
are standing on the bow of the boat.  Chef is at the helm.
The men stare forward in amazement.  Willard has the
binoculars around his neck.  He brings them up to his eyes
and looks.

                      WILLARD
               (to Chef)
          Just keep moving.
               (to Lance)
          Lance, keep your hands away from
          the guns.

OUR VIEW MOVES slowly behind them and we SEE that they
see.

Hundreds of Montagnard natives, body and faces painted
white, of the most savage nature, but there is a purity
about them.  Men and boys stand passively on canoes side
by side, blocking the river.

There are also hundreds of other NATIVES lining the shore
on both sides, dressed in most ornate and primitive manner,
in feathers, parts of birds and animals.  Fires and dead
bodies are everywhere.

OUR VIEW MOVES

Behind the PBR, closer and closer to this fantastic human
wall blocking them.  The natives accept the PBR, allowing
it to pass into them with a sort of inevitability.

VIEW ON WILLARD, LANCE AND CHEF

Reacting as they pass through the natives on canoes, then
look up toward the bask.

WHAT THEY SEE:

The temple.  A magnificent fortified encampment built around
the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.

NEW ANGLE - FULL VIEW BEHIND THE PBR AS IT PROCEEDS

The scale of this thing is enormous.  Great enigmatic
Cambodian faces carved out of stone from thousands of years
ago.  The fortress reaches out across the river where part
of its ruins still stand on the opposite side nod on a
small island.  It's as though the river flowed into the
great rams of the sphinx-like temple.  Aligning the
fortifications are concertina wire, automatic weapons
emplacements.  There is even wreckage of Hueys as armed
machine gun nests.  It is a strange combination of the
very modern and the very primitive.  In this installation,
WE SEE LIVING families, fires, nomadic dwellings, several
HUNDRED of the most primitive MOTAGNARDS that ever existed.
Some carry spears, occasionally other emerge from the
jungle, scurrying around with the activity that the arrival
of a stranger brings.  The air is heavy with the weight of
hundreds of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.  A think greasy smoke hangs
from fires that burn and around the fort.  Fresh shell
craters indicate a recent battle.  Near the dock, and
everywhere else, there are tangled piles of corpses, half-
submerged in the water, piles of bodies of the dead.

As the PBR moves up, a HEAD suddenly is thrust into VIEW.
The heads is that of a particularly wild, long-haired,
stubble-faced MAN.  He has three or four camera bodies
around his neck; a large bag stuffed with lenses and film.
He is dressed in rags and tatters.  He shouts out.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          It's all right!  It's all right!
          It's been approved!

The PBR moves slowly toward the steps, as the man continues
to shout out.

                      CHEF
          I ain't coming in there!  Them
          bastards attacked us!

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Zap 'em with your siren, man.  Zap
          'em with your siren.

Chef BLOWS THE SIREN on the PBR.  The Natives react, never
having heard one before; they scatter in all directions,
running away scared.

The photographer moves down onto the landing, directing
the boat.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          There's mines over there!  Mines
          over there, too!  And watch out,
          those goddamn monkeys bit you, I
          tell you.

The PBR crew are exhausted, staring at him through their
mud-and-blood splattered faces.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Move it in right toward me.

He jumps onboard the boat and immediately advances towards
Lance.  He shakes his hand, moves to the others, and shakes
their hands as well.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          I'm an American.  An American
          civilian.  Hi, Yanks.  Hi.
          American.  American civilian.
          It's all right.
               (to Chef)
          And you got the cigarettes, and
          what's what I've been dreaming of.

Chef flips him a packet of cigarettes.

                      WILLARD
               (or photographer)
          Who are you?

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Who are you?  I'm a photojournalist.
          I've covered the war since '64.
          I've been in Loas, Cambodia, 'Man...
               (looking around the
               boat)
          I'll tell you one thing.  This
          boat is a mess, man.

                      WILLARD
               (gestures to natives)
          Who are all these people?

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          They think you've come to take him
          away.  I hope that isn't true.

                      WILLARD
          Take who away?

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
               (gestures to temple)
          Him!  Colonel Kurtz!  These are
          all his children, man, as far as
          you can see.  Hell, man, out here,
          we are all his children.

                      WILLARD
          Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Hey, man, you don't talk to the
          Colonel.  Well, you listen to him.

Willard steps off the boat onto the steps.  He turns and
looks back at the Photographer.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          The man's enlarged my mind.  He's
          a poet-warrior in a classic sense.
          I mean, sometimes he'll-well, you
          say hello to him, right?  And he'll
          just walk right by you and he won't
          even notice you.  And then suddenly
          he'll grab you and he'll throw you
          in a corner and he'll say "Do you
          know that the 'if' is the middle
          word in 'life'?  If you can keep
          your head when all about you are
          losing theirs and blaming it on
          you.  If you can trust yourself
          when all men doubt you." I'm a
          little man, I'm a little man.
          He's a great man.
               (a beat)
          "I should have been a pair of ragged
          claws scuttling across floors of
          silent seas."

Willard, incredulous, turns away to Lance.

                      WILLARD
          Stay with the boat.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Don't go without me, okay.  I want
          to get a picture.

Willard and Chef start up the steps.  The Photographer
walks with them, taking photographs.

TRACKING SHOT

They reach the top of the steps.  Gradually the natives
and savages show themselves-fierce and frightening, jungle
fighters, mostly Montagnard.  They wear only loincloths
and bandoleers of ammunition.  Their bodies are painted in
strange patterns.  Death and parts of bodies are everywhere.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          He can be terrible, and he can be
          mean, and he can be right.  He's
          fighting the war.  He's a great
          man.  I mean, I wish I had words
          you know?  I wish I had words.  I
          could tell you something like, the
          other day he wanted to kill me.

                      WILLARD
          Why did he want to kill you?

They come to a stop.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Because I took his picture.  He
          said, "If you take my picture again,
          I'm going to kill you." And he
          meant it.  See, just lay cool, lay
          cool.  Lay back, dig it.

They start walking forward again, as the photographer
continues.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          He gets friendly again, he really
          does.  But you don't judge the
          colonel.  You don't judge the
          colonel like ordinary men.

ANGLE ON  WILLARD

looking carefully as he moves forward

MOVING POV

More natives and savages.  Interspersed among them are a
few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of army
insignia on them.

ANGLE ON  WILLARD

reacting, as he moves forward.  Chef is frightened, as he
follows Willard.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They move closer and closer to the temple.  The photographer
runs up ahead of Willard and stops in front of the man
with paler skins...these are remnants of the Green Beret
"A" Team.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Okay, watch it now!  These are
          Americans!  Americans!
               (to Willard)
          You can feel the vibe of this place.
          Let me take a picture.  Hey, could
          you hold it?  Hello?  Could you
          hold it for a minute?

The photographer starts clicking away with a Nikon, as
Willard moves toward what once must have been an American.
He wears only a shotgun cartridge and striker pants.  His
face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke, matted mud and
grease.

Willard stops and looks at him.

                      WILLARD
          Colby?

Colby is silent.  Then he and the other Berets, woman,
children, etc., slowly part, making way for Willard.
Willard slowly moves through the group and looks.

WHAT HE SEES

The stone steps of the temple.  Resting on the steps are
freshly screed heads, blood washing down from them.  They
sit decorating the entrance to the temple like so many
gruesome pumpkins.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          The heads.  You're looking at the
          heads.  Sometimes he goes too far,
          and he's the first one to admit
          it.

Chef, behind Willard, looks at the heads.

                      CHEF
          He's gone crazy.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Wrong!  Wrong!  If you could have
          heard the man just two days ago,
          if you could've heard him then.
          God.  You were gonna call him crazy?

                      CHEF
          Fucking A.

                      WILLARD
          I just want to talk to him.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Well, man, he's gone away.  He
          disappeared out in the jungle with
          his people.

He continues forward.  The others follow.

                      WILLARD
          I'll wait for him.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          He feels comfortable with his
          people.  He forgets himself with
          his people.  He forgets himself.

                      CHEF
          Captain, maybe we should wait back
          at the boat.

                      WILLARD
               (turns back to him)
          Okay, Chef, we'll go back to the
          boat for a while.

                      CHEF
          Yeah.  Stay with Lance.

EXT. KURTZ COMPOUND - DUSK

A stone head with palm ;eaves hanging over it.

EXT. PBR - DUSK

Lance is squatting at the bow of the boat holding a spear,
sticking it into the water, probably trying to spear a
fish.

A GROUP OF NATIVES are gathered by the steps of the dock.
One of the natives climbs the tree next to the dock and
cuts loose a dead body.  It falls into the river with a
splash.

Chef sits next to Willard in the cabin.

                      CHEF
          This colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
          He's worse than crazy, he's evil!
          That's what the man's got set up
          here, man!  It's fucking pagan
          idolatry!  Look around you!  Shit,
          he's loco.

Willard is putting on his tiger shirt.

                      WILLARD
          Then you'll help me?

                      CHEF
          Fucking A, I'll help you.  I'll do
          anything to get out of this joint!
          We could blow all them assholes
          away!

CAMERA PANS the savages onshore, who have gathered around
them, watching them.  We SEE a sign written in a wild hand
with white spray paint on a wall: "OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE
NOW!"

                      CHEF
          They're so fucking spaced out,
          they wouldn't even know it.  I
          ain't afraid of all them fucking
          skulls and altars and shit!  I
          used to think that if I died in an
          evil place, then my soul wouldn't
          make it to heaven.  But now...fuck.
          I don't care where it goes, as
          long as it ain't here.  So what do
          you want to do?  I'll kill the
          fuck.

                      WILLARD
               (picks up the map)
          No, no.  I'm gonna need you to
          wait here, Chef.  I'll go up with
          Lance and scrounge around, check
          the place out, see if I can find
          the colonel, okay?

                      CHEF
          But what do you want me to do?
          Damnit.

Willard picks up a field radio and hands it to Chef, Chef
looks at it.

                      WILLARD
          Here, you take the radio, and if I
          don't get back by 22:00 hours, you
          call in the air strike.

Chef stares at him.

                      CHEF
          Air strike?

                      WILLARD
          The code is "Almighty," coordinates
          zero-nine-two-six-four-seven-one-
          two.  It's all in there.

He hands the map to Chef.

EXT. KURTZ COMPOUND - DAY

Willard and Lance walk through the temple grounds in the
rain.  Willard is gradually surrounded by more and more
native soldiers.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Everything I saw told me that Kurtz
          had gone insane.  The place was
          full of bodies.  North Vietnamese,
          Vietcong, Cambodians...If I was

          wanted me that way.

The soldiers close in on him, pick him up, and turn him
upside down, rolling him in the mud.

He is slowly walking among passing natives.  He is oblivious

INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Willard, hands tied behind his back, is guided down a long
corridor, followed by two Montagnards, both armed.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          It smelled like slow death in there.
          Malaria and nightmares.  This was
          the end of the river, all right.

They turn into the main room.  The natives indicate for
Willard to kneel down on the floor.  The CAMERA MOVES,
REVEALING KURTZ lying in shadow on a bed.  We will SEE him
only in darkness and shadow throughout the scene.

                      KURTZ
          Where you from, Willard?

                      WILLARD
          I'm from Ohio, sir.

                      KURTZ
          Were you born there?

                      WILLARD
          Yes, sire.

                      KURTZ
          Whereabouts?

                      WILLARD
          Toledo, sir.

                      KURTZ
          How far are you from the river?

                      WILLARD
          The Ohio River, sir?  About two
          hundred miles.

                      KURTZ
          I went down that river once when I
          was a kid.  There's a place in the
          river, I can't remember...must
          have been a gardenia plantation,
          or a flower plantation at one time.
          It's all wild and overgrown now.
          But for about five miles, you'd
          think that heaven just fell on the
          earth, in the form of gardenias.

Kurtz reaches down and picks up a bowl full of water.  He
splashes water on his face and head.

                      KURTZ
          Have you ever considered, any real
          freedoms?  Freedoms from the
          opinions of others.  Even the
          opinions of yourself.  Did they
          say why, Willard?  Why they wanted
          to terminate my command?

                      WILLARD
          I was sent on a classified mission,
          sir.

                      KURTZ
          Its no longer classified, is it.
          What did they tell you?

                      WILLARD
          They told me, that you had
          gone...totally insane.  And that
          your methods were unsound.

                      KURTZ
          Are my methods unsound?

                      WILLARD
          I don't see any method at all,
          sir.

                      KURTZ
          I expected someone like you.  What
          did you expect?  Are you an
          assassin?

                      WILLARD
          I'm a soldier.

We finally SEE KURTZ'S FACE.

                      KURTZ
          You're neither.  You're an errand
          boy, sent by grocery clerks, to
          collect a bill.

EXT. KURTZ COMPOUND - TRAIL UP FROM RIVER - DAY

The photographer hurries down the trail past villagers and
soldiers toward the compound, and up the hill that leads
toward the TIGER CAGES in front of the Monkey Temple.  He
spots a jug full of water, with a ladle in it.

AT TIGER CAGES - TO GO WITH PHOTOGRAPHER

The photographer moves to Willard who is in a tiger cage.
Willard is in pretty bad shape, weak and thirsty.  The
photographer stops in front of him.  He holds the ladle
for Willard to drink from.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          Why?  Why would a nice guy like
          you want to kill a genius?  Feeling
          pretty good, huh?  Why?  Do you
          know that the man really likes
          you?

He puts a cigarette in Willard's mouth.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          He likes you.  He really likes
          you.  But he's got something in
          mind for you.  Aren't you curious
          about that?  I'm curious.  I'm
          very curious.  Are you curious?

The photographer walks around Willard's cage.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER
          There's something happening out
          here, man.  You know something,
          man?  I know something you that
          you don't know.  That's right,
          Jack . The man is clear in his
          mind, but his soul is mad.  Oh,
          yeah.  He's dying, I think.  He
          hates all this.  He hates it!  But
          the man's a...He reads poetry out
          loud, all right?  And a voice...he
          likes you 'cause you're still alive.
          He's got plans for you.  No, I'm
          not gonna help you.  You're gonna
          help him, man.  You're gonna help
          him.  I mean, what are they gonna
          sat when he's gone?  'Cause he
          dies when it dies, when it dies,
          he dies!  What are they gonna say
          about him?  He was a kind man?  He
          was a wise man?  He has plans?  He
          has wisdom?  Bullshit, man!  Am I
          gonna be the one that's gonna set
          them straight?  Look at me!  Wrong!

INT. CONEX CONTAINER - DAY

Willard is passed out, lying on the floor of a metal CONEX
CONTAINER.  It is hot.  Some CHILDREN are peeking in at
him.

The two front doors of the container are opened.  Light
floods in.  Kurtz is standing there with the children.  He
holds a bunch of magazine articles.

He sits down on a dirt step, surrounded by children.

He looks down at a magazine article and begins to read it
to Willard.

                      KURTZ
               (reading)
          "Time magazine.  The weekly news
          magazine.  September 22, 1967,
          volume ninety, number twelve.  The
          War on the Horizon.  The American
          people may find it hard to believe
          that the U.S. is winning the war
          in Vietnam.  Nevertheless, one of
          the most exhaustive inquiries into
          the status of the conflict yet
          compiled, offers considerable
          evidence that the weight of U.S.
          power, two and a half years after
          the bug buildup began, is beginning
          to make itself felt.  White House
          officials maintain the impact of
          that strength may bring the enemy
          to the point where he could simply
          be unable to continue fighting."
               (to Willard)
          Is this familiar?

Willard reacts.

                      KURTZ
               (reading)
          "Because Lyndon Johnson fears that
          the U.S. public is in no mood to
          accept its optimistic conclusions,
          he may never permit the report to
          be released in full.  Even so, he
          is sufficiently impressed with the
          findings, and sufficiently anxious
          to make their conclusions known,
          to permit experts who have been
          working on it to talk about it in
          general terms."  No date, Time
          Magazine.  "Sir Robert Thompson,
          who led the victory over the
          Communists guerrillas in Malay,
          and who is now a RAND Corporation
          consultant, recently returned to
          Vietnam to sound out the situation
          for President Nixon.  He told the
          president last week that things
          felt much better, and smelled much
          better over there."

He looks over at Willard.

                      KURTZ
               (to Willard)
          How do they smell to you, soldier?

Willard doesn't answer.  Kurtz rises.  The children are
laughing and giggling.  Kurtz drops the magazine articles
in Willard's lap.

                      KURTZ
          You'll be free.  You'll be under
          guard.  Read these at your leisure.
          Don't lose them.  Don't try to
          escape, you'll be shot.  We can
          talk of these things later.

Kurtz turns and exits, closing one of the doors, leaving
the other open.  Willard watches him go.  The children
stay, looking at him, laughing and giggling.  Willard slowly
and painfully pulls himself to his feet.  He stands there
a moment looking at the children, then collapses to the
floor.

          when you go from here to Venus?
          That's dialectic physics, okay?
          Dialectic logic is, there's only
          love and hate.  You either love
          somebody, or you hate them.

Kurtz throws a bunch of bananas at the photographer.

          On the river, I thought that the
          minute I looked at him, I'd know
          what to do.  But it didn't happen.
          I was in there with him for days.
          Not under guard.  I was free.  But
          he knew I wasn't going anywhere.
          He knew more about what I was going
          to do at I did.  If the generals
          back in Nah Trang could see what I
          saw, would they still want me to
          kill him?  More than ever, probably.
          And what would his people back
          home want, if they ever learned
          just how far from them he'd really
          gone.  He broke from them, and

Colby is standing in the rear doorway of the main temple,
going through a Tai Chi routine.  Willard sits in front of
him, looking at Kurtz, listening to him as he talks from
the bed.  A native WOMAN is there, listening as well.

                      KURTZ
          I remember when I was with Special
          Forces.  Seems a thousand centuries
          ago.  We went into a camp to
          inoculate some children.  We'd
          left the camp after we had
          inoculated the children for polio.
          And this old man came running after
          us, and he was crying.  He couldn't
          say.  We went back there, and they
          had come and hacked off every
          inoculated arm.  They they were,
          in a pile.  A pile of little arms.
          And, I remember, I cried, I wept
          like some grandmother.  I wanted
          to tear my teeth out.  I didn't
          know what I wanted to do.  And I
          want to remember it.  I never want
          to forget it.  I never want to
          forget it.  And then I realized,
          like I was shot, like I was shot
          with a diamond bullet through my
          forehead.  And I thought, My God,
          the genius of that!  The genius.
          The will to do that.  Perfect,
          genuine, complete, crystalline,
          pure.  And then I realized, they
          were stronger than we.  Because
          they could stand it.  These were
          not monsters.  These were men,
          strained cadres.  These men who
          fought with their hearts, who have
          families, who have children, who
          are filled with love...that they
          had the strength, the strength to
          do that.  If I had ten divisions
          of those men, then our troubles
          here would be over very quickly.
          You have to have men who are moral,
          and at the same time, who are able
          to utilize their primordial
          instincts to kill without feeling,
          without passion.  Without judgment.
          Without Judgment.  Because it's
          judgment  that defeats us.

CLOSE ON WILLARD

On the boat, lying on his back.  He rolls over.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          They were gonna make me a major
          for this, and I wasn't even in
          their fucking army anymore.
          Everybody wanted me to do it.  Him
          most of all.  I felt like he was
          up there, waiting for me to take
          his pain away.  He just wanted to
          go out like a soldier.

He gets up and emerges out of darkness.

                      WILLARD (V.O.)
          Standing up.  Not even like some
          poor, wasted rag-assed renegade.
          Even the jungle wanted him dead.
          And that's who he really who he
          took his orders from, anyway.

EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON  LANCE

smearing the water buffalo with blood that he pours from a
pitcher along its neck, in preparation for the ceremony.

MIST OVER WATER

A small bubble rises to the surface, then another.  Suddenly
but quietly, water ad mud pour off revealing Willard,
emerging slowly, head first, as if he was growing out of
the water.

WATER BUFFALO

Its head being tied to a stake.

KURTZ

Silhouetted in the doorway of the temple.  He enters the
temple.

WILLARD

Sits crouched holding a machete as natives dance in the
background.  He rises slowly and then runs off.

INT. INSIDE THE TEMPLE - NIGHT

Willard works his way toward the interior of the temple.
He appears behind a guard, pouts his hand over the warriors
mouth, brings up the machete, and pulls him back into the
dark shadows.

INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING ACTION WITH WATER BUFFALO CEREMONY

Kurtz is sitting and talking into a tape recorder.  Willard
slowly moves forward, quietly sneaking toward Kurtz as he
speaks.

                      KURTZ ()
          We train young men to drop fire on
          people, but their commanders won't
          allow them to write "fuck" on their
          airplanes because it's obscene.

Willard steps behind Kurtz, raising the machete.  Kurtz
turns.  Willard brings the knife down and starts hacking
away at Kurtz, hitting him first on the shoulder, then all
over.

NATIVES

Simultaneously slashing a knife into the back of the water
buffalo.

KURTZ

Falls to the floor.

WATER BUFFALO

Falling to the ground as natives swing knives into its
back.

WILLARD

Staring at Kurtz.

CLOSE ON KURTZ

Lying on the ground.

                      KURTZ
          The horror....the horror.

He dies.

WILLARD

stands at the temple entrance.  He looks at the natives
outside.  He walks over to Kurtz's desk.  Flips through
Kurtz's manuscript and stops.  We SEE handwriting on the
pages: "Drop the Bomb, Exterminate them all."

EXT. FRONT OF TEMPLE - NIGHT

The natives are all gathered in front of the temple, looking
at Willard as he moves forward holding the machete and
Kurtz's books.  The entire village is there, about a
THOUSAND NATIVES in all.  They realize that Willard is now
their leader and pay homage to him by kneeling or sitting
down.

Willard slowly walks down the steps, throwing down the
machete.  The natives rise and throw down their weapons in
imitation as he walks through them.  He moves to LANCE,
who is in the midst of all the natives.  Willard looks at
him, then takes him by the hand and pulls him away with
him through the rest of the natives.

EXT. PBR - RAIN - NIGHT

The PBR pulls way from the shore.  Willard is at the helm
of the boat.  Lance is squatting by the spotlight.

                      MALE VOICE (OVER RADIO)
          Calling PBR Street Gang.  PBR Street
          Gang, this is Almighty.  Do you
          read me?  Over.  PBR Street Gang,
          this is Almighty.

Willard turns off the radio.

The PBR moves along the river, away from the flaming
shoreline.
