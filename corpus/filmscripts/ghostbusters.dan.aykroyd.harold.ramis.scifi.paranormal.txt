GHOSTBUSTERS
Final Film Transcript
original script by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis
transcribed by Adam Bertocci


Outside New York Public Library
Eerie music. Pigeons fly from the steps.

New York Public Library, reading room
ALICE pushes a cart of books.

New York Public Library, basement
ALICE brings some books down to the basement of library. As she walks along, a few books float to other shelves. When she turns around to investigate, nothing happens.
She makes some notes on a pad and passes a card catalog. The drawers slide open, spilling cards all over the place. She screams and runs.
She runs through the shelves.
Comes to what must be the ghost; she screams. Her hair blows back.
Ghostbusters logo dissolves onto screen. Music: Ghostbusters.

Columbia University
Main title pops up. Ghostbusters theme keeps playing. We see people going in and out of the building.

Corridor outside Paranormal Studies Laboratory
We hear DR. PETER VENKMAN giving the ESP test. On door: "Dr. Egon Spengler Dr. Raymond Stantz Dr. Peter Venkman Venkman burn in hell Maid please make up this room as soon as possible"

Inside lab
PETER gives ESP test to MALE STUDENT and JENNIFER. MALE STUDENT is hooked up to electrodes.

PETER
All right, I'm going to turn over the next card. I want you to concentrate. I want you to tell me what it is.
card is a star

MALE STUDENT
Square?

PETER
showing him card and shocking him
Good guess, but wrong.
holds a circle card up in front of JENNIFER
Clear your head. All right, tell me what you think it is.

JENNIFER
Is it a star?

PETER
It is a star! Very good. That's great.
holds up a square card for MALE STUDENT
All right. Think hard. What is it?

MALE STUDENT
Circle?

PETER
showing him square and shocking him
Ooh, close, but definitely wrong.
MALE STUDENT's gum shoots out of his mouth. He puts it back in and keeps chewing. PETER holds a plus sign card up for JENNIFER.
Okay. All right. Ready? What is it?
no answer
Come on.

JENNIFER
Figure eight.

PETER
pretending to be astonished
Incredible. That's five for five. You can't see these, can you?

JENNIFER
No, no.

PETER
You're not cheating me, are you?

JENNIFER
No, I swear, they're just coming to me.

PETER
to MALE STUDENT
Okay. Nervous?

MALE STUDENT
Yes... I don't like this.

PETER
Don't worry, you only have seventy-five more to go.
holds up a card with three wavy lines
Okay, what's this one?

MALE STUDENT
A couple of wavy lines.

PETER
who wants to zap him just for fun
Sorry! This isn't your lucky day!

MALE STUDENT
I know. I -
PETER reaches for the little lever. JENNIFER seems amused, so PETER winks to her. MALE STUDENT stumbles over some words before PETER zaps him.
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this!

PETER
You volunteered, didn't you? We're paying you, aren't we?

MALE STUDENT
Yeah, but I didn't know you were giving me electric shocks! What are you trying to prove here anyway?

PETER
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

MALE STUDENT
The effect?! I'll tell you what the effect is! It's pissing me off!

PETER
Well, then maybe my theory is correct!

MALE STUDENT
ripping electrodes off hands
You can keep the five bucks, I've had it!
runs out of room and slams door

PETER
I will mister!
kindly, to JENNIFER
You may as well get used to that, that's the kind of resentment that your ability is going to provoke in some people.

JENNIFER
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

PETER
You're no fluke, Jennifer.
DR. RAYMOND STANTZ enters the room, all in a flurry.

RAY
grabbing stuff off shelves
This is it! This is definitely it! Did those UV lenses come in for the video camera? And that blank tape? I need it. The one you erased yesterday.

PETER
to JENNIFER
Can you excuse me for a second?

JENNIFER
Sure.
PETER runs to RAY, jumps up and smacks him on the head.

PETER
I'm right in the middle of something, Ray! Ah, I need a little more time with this subject. Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half?

RAY
Peter, at 1:40 PM at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free floating, full torso, vaporous apparition. It blew books off shelves from twenty feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian!

PETER
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased. I want you to get right down there, check it out and get back to me.

RAY
No, no.

PETER
Get right back to me...

RAY
You're coming with us on this one! Spengler went down there and took PKE valances. Went right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle! We're close on this one. I can feel it!

PETER
I can feel it. We're very, very close.
to JENNIFER
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd like to work with you some more. Perhaps you could come back this evening, say at -

JENNIFER
Eight o'clock?

PETER
I was just about to say eight o'clock! You are a legitimate phenomenon!

Outside New York Public Library
PETER is yelling at RAY all the way there.

PETER
As a friend I have to tell you: you've finally gone round the bend on this ghost business. You guys have been running your ass off meeting and greeting every schizo in the five boroughs who says he has a paranormal experience. What have you seen?

New York Public Library, reading room

RAY
Of course you forget, Peter, I was present at an undersea, unexplained, mass sponge migration.

PETER
Ooh, Ray, those sponges migrated about a foot and a half.
DR. EGON SPENGLER is under the table, listening to it with a stethescope. PETER runs over to him and speaks in a zombie voice.
Egon...
EGON is puzzled. PETER raps table with knuckles, then slams it with a book. EGON is starled and jumps up.

EGON
Oh, you're here.

PETER
Yeah, what have you got?

EGON
This is big, Peter. This is very big. There is definitely something here.

PETER
Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head. You remember that?

EGON
That would have worked if you hadn't stopped me.
LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR walks up to the three.

LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR
I'm Roger Delicore. Are you the men from the university?

PETER
introducing them all
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman. Dr. Stantz, Egon.

LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR
Thank you for coming. I hope we can clear this up quickly and quietly.

PETER
Let's not rush things. We don't even know what you have yet.
They go to a smaller room. ALICE is lying on a table.

ALICE
I don't remember seeing any legs, but it definitely had arms because it reached out for me.

RAY
Arms?! I can't wait to get a look at this thing!

PETER
Alice, I'm going to ask you a few standard questions, okay? Have you or any of your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent?

ALICE
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

PETER
I'd call that a big yes. Uh, are you habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol?

ALICE
No!

PETER
No, no. Just asking. Are you, Alice, menstruating right now?

LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR
What has that got to do with it?

PETER
Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

EGON
Ray, it's moving.

New York Public Library, basement
EGON is in front, with PKE meter. RAY has a video camera. PETER is in the back, bored stiff. He starts making scary gestures at RAY. They come to a tall tower of books.

RAY
Look!

EGON
This is hot, Ray.

RAY
Symmetrical book stacking, just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.

PETER
You're right. No human being would stack books like this.

RAY
Listen!
eerie music
You smell something?
they go to a card catalog; it is slimed
Talk about telekinetic activity! Look at this mess!

EGON
Raymond, look at this.

RAY
Ectoplasmic residue.

EGON
Venkman, get a sample of this.

RAY
It's the real thing!

PETER
Somebody blows their nose and you want to keep it?

EGON
I'd like to analyze it.
As RAY and EGON continue talking, PETER scrapes slime into a dish. Gets it all over his hands. Groans and grunts. Flicks slime away. Wipes hands and feet on books.

RAY
There's more over here!

EGON
I'm getting stronger readings here, this way.

RAY
Come on.
They turn a corner. PETER gives EGON slime.

PETER
Egon, your mucus.
a bookshelf falls with a crash
This happen to you before?
RAY shakes head
Oh, first time?
RAY nods. They continue. EGON's PKE meter goes nuts. They see LIBRARY GHOST.

EGON
It's here.

RAY
A full torso apparition, and it's real.

PETER
So what do we do?
no answer
Could you come over here and talk to me for a second, please?
pulls RAY by the ear
Could you just come over here for a second, please? Right over here. Come here, Francine! Come here. What do we do?

RAY
I don't know. What do you think?
EGON starts with calculator, but PETER slaps it away

PETER
Stop that!

RAY
We've got to make contact. One of us should actually try to speak to it.

EGON
Good idea.
They look to PETER. He groans and goes to the ghost. RAY starts taking pictures.

PETER
Hello. I'm Peter. Where are you from? Originally.

LIBRARY GHOST
Ssh.

PETER
going back
All right. Okay, the usual stuff isn't working.

RAY
Okay, I have a plan. I know exactly what to do. Now stay close, stay close. I know. Do exactly as I say. Ready, ready, get her!
LIBRARY GHOST turns into a monster and scares them. They run away. Music: Cleanin' Up The Town.

Outside New York Public Library
PETER, RAY and EGON run away.

LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR
Did you see it? What was it?

PETER
We'll get back to you!

LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR
What?!

Columbia University grounds
PETER, RAY and EGON go back to the lab. PETER is laughing at RAY.

PETER
Hee, hee, hee! Get her. That was your whole plan. Get her. It was scientific.

RAY
I just got overexcited. But wasn't it incredible, Pete? I mean, we actually touched the etheric plane. You know what this could mean to the university?

PETER
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the microchip. Ray, I'm very excited.

EGON
working with calculator
I wouldn't say the experience was totally wasted. According to these new readings, I think we have an excellent chance of actually catching a ghost and holding it indefinitely.

RAY
Well, this is great! If this ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we could really bust some heads! In a spiritual sense, of course.

PETER
Spengs? You serious about this catching a ghost?

EGON
I'm always serious.

PETER
Egon, I'm gonna take back some of the things I've said about you. You... you've earned it.
gives EGON a candy bar

Their lab
Moving men cart stuff out of the room. DEAN YEAGER stands in wait. Music: I Can Wait Forever.

RAY
The possibilities are, are limitless! Hey, Dean Yeager!

PETER
I trust you're moving us to better quarters on campus.

DEAN YEAGER
No! You're being moved off campus. The board of regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.

PETER
This is preposterous. I demand an explanation.

DEAN YEAGER
Fine. The university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.

PETER
But the kids love us!

DEAN YEAGER
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind. You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle. Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable. You, Dr. Venkman, are a poor scientist.

PETER
I see.

DEAN YEAGER
And you have no place in this department or in this university.

Outside Columbia University
RAY is worriedly pacing. PETER is relaxing with a bottle.

RAY
This is a major disgrace. Forget MIT or Stanford now. They wouldn't touch us with a ten-meter cattle-prod.

PETER
You're always so concerned about your reputation. Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent clerk!

RAY
You know how much a patent clerk earns?

PETER
No!

RAY
Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities. We didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like out there. I've worked in the private sector. They expect results.

PETER
For whatever reasons, Ray, call it fate. Call it luck. Call it karma. I believe that everything happens for a reason. I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.

RAY
For what purpose?

PETER
To go into business for ourselves.
Offers RAY a drink. RAY drinks.

RAY
This ecto-containment system that Spengler and I have in mind is going to require a load of bread to capitalize. Where are we going to get the money?

PETER
I don't know.
drinks
I don't know.


Outside Manhattan City Bank
The three come out of the bank. Fanfare.

PETER
You're never going to regret this, Ray!

RAY
My parents left me that house! I was born there!

PETER
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

RAY
But at nineteen percent! You didn't even bargain with the guy!

EGON
flashing a calculator
Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone for the first five years comes to $95,000.

PETER
Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade. Professional paranormal investigations and eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

Outside Hook and Ladder No. 8
The building's windows are whitewashed. We hear REAL ESTATE AGENT talking.

Inside Hook and Ladder No. 8
REAL ESTATE WOMAN shows PETER and EGON the fire house.

REAL ESTATE WOMAN
There's office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor and a full kitchen on the top left.

PETER
It just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all. What do you think, Egon?

EGON
I think this building should be condemned. There's serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring is substandard, it's completely inadequate for our power needs, and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.

RAY
calling to them from upstairs
Hey! Does this pole still work?
slides down the fire pole
Wow! This place is great! When can we move in? You've got to try this pole! I'm gonna get my stuff.
runs up stairs
Hey, we should stay here tonight. Sleep here! You know, to try it out!

PETER
I think we'll take it.

REAL ESTATE WOMAN
Good.

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
The building is huge and grandiose. Ominous music. Show the terror dog statues on the roof. DANA BARRETT gets out of a taxi and enters the building.

Inside Shandor Building
DANA gets off the elevator. Sees a neighbor.

DANA
Oh, hi.
LOUIS TULLY pops out of his apartment

LOUIS
Oh, Dana, it's you!

DANA
Oh, hi, yes Louis, it's me.

LOUIS
I thought it was the drugstore.

DANA
Oh, are you sick?

LOUIS
Oh! No, no, I'm fine, I feel great! Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising. I taped a 20-minute workout and played it back at high speed on my machine so it only took ten minutes. I got a great workout.

DANA
Good.

LOUIS
You wanna come in for a mineral water or something?

DANA
Oh, I'd really like to, Louis, but I have to go rehearsal now. Excuse me.

LOUIS
No sweat, I'll take a rain check on that. I always have plenty of low sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods in the house. But you already know that.

DANA
Yeah, I know that.

LOUIS
Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients, my fourth anniversary as an accountant, you know, and even though you do your own tax return, which you shouldn't do, I'd like you to stop by, being that you're my neighbor and all -

DANA
cutting him off
Well, thank you, Louis, I'll really try to stop by.

LOUIS
Listen, that reminds me, you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. The creep down the hall phoned the manager.

DANA
That's strange, I didn't realize I'd left it on.

LOUIS
Well, yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable, but I couldn't get in, so you know what I did? I turned my TV up real loud too so everyone would think all our TVs had something wrong with them -

DANA
closing her door on him
Bye, Louis.

LOUIS
Okay, so I'll see you later, huh?! I'll give you a call! I'm going to go have a shower.
tries to open his door, but he's locked himself out

DANA's living room
DANA watches an ad on TV. In the ad: PETER, RAY and EGON stand outside the fire house wearing long blue coats and talk to the camera.

RAY
Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?

EGON
Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?

PETER
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?

RAY
If the answer is yes, then don't wait another minute. Pick up your phone and call the professionals.

PETER, RAY, EGON
Ghostbusters!

RAY
Our courteous and efficient staff is on call twenty-four hours a day to serve all your supernatural elimination needs.

PETER, RAY, EGON
We're ready to believe you!
Message flashes on screen: "GHOSTBUSTERS 555-2368".
DANA turns off TV.

DANA's kitchen
DANA lays some groceries out on the table. She turns around. Eggs tremble, leap out of their shells and cook on counter. Growling noise from fridge. DANA opens fridge.
The spirit world appears in front of her. A terror dog, ZUUL, jumps out in front of her.

ZUUL
roaring
Zuul!
DANA closes fridge, screaming

Outside Ghostbusters HQ
PETER watches Marty put up a sign, reading "GHOSTBUSTERS" in small type.

PETER
You don't think it's too subtle, Marty? You don't think people are going to drive down and not see the sign?
Marty shakes head. Dark blue hearse drives up.
You can't park that here!

RAY
getting out of car
Everybody can relax, I found the car! Needs some suspension work; and shocks, and brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear end -

PETER
How much?

RAY
as PETER groans
Only forty-eight hundred. And maybe new rings, also mufflers, a little wiring...

Inside Ghostbusters HQ
The secretary, JANINE MELNITZ, sits at her desk reading a magazine. PETER comes up.

PETER
Janine! Any calls?

JANINE
No.

PETER
Any messages?

JANINE
No.

PETER
Any customers?

JANINE
No, Dr. Venkman.

PETER
It's a good job, isn't it? Type something, will you? We're paying you for this stuff!... Don't stare at me, you got them bug eyes... Janine! Sorry about the bug eyes thing. I'll be in my office.
PETER goes off. EGON pops up out from under JANINE's desk.

JANINE
You're very handy. I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too.

EGON
Print is dead.

JANINE
Oh, that's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual, but I think it's a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racquetball. Do you have any hobbies?

EGON
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
DANA enters

DANA
Hello?
goes to JANINE
Oh. Excuse me. This, this is the Ghostbusters' office?

JANINE
filing nails
Yes, it is. Can I help you?

DANA
I don't have an appointment. I'd like to talk to someone, please.

PETER
bolting out of his office
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?

DANA
Well, I don't know. What I'm about to say may sound a little unusual.

PETER
Oh, that's all we get day in, day out around this place. Come into my office, Miss -

DANA
Barrett, Dana Barrett.

Lab in fire house
DANA is hooked up to a machine. As she talks, PETER, RAY and EGON watch a monitor which turns her head different colors.

DANA
And this voice said "Zuul". And then I slammed the refrigerator door and I left. That was two days ago, and I haven't been back to my apartment.

PETER
Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. What do you think it was?

DANA
Well, if I knew what it was I wouldn't be here.

PETER
Egon, what do you think?

EGON
shining a head lamp in PETER's eyes
She's telling the truth. At least, she thinks she is.

DANA
Well, of course I'm telling the truth! Who would make up a story like that?

PETER
Some are people who just want attention. Others, just nutballs who come in off the street.

RAY
You know what it could be? Past-life experience intruding on present time.

EGON
Could be erased memories stored in the collective unconscious. I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact, either.

DANA
I'm sorry, I don't believe in any of those things.

PETER
Well, that's all right. I don't either. But there are some things we do. Standard procedures we carry out in a case like this which often bring us results.

RAY
Well, I could go down to the hall of records and check out the structural details in the building. Maybe the building itself has a history of psychic turbulence.

PETER
nodding
Right, go do that.

EGON
I could look for the name Zuul in the usual literature.

RAY
Spates Catalog.

EGON
Tobin's Spirit Guide.

RAY
Yeah.

PETER
Tell you what. I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out - I'll go check out Miss Barrett's apartment, okay?
knows he's said the wrong thing; groans to himself

DANA
Okay, thank you.

DANA's living room
PETER and DANA enter.

PETER
Let me. If something's gonna happen here I want it to happen to me first.
Opens a few closet doors. Nothing happens.

DANA
The closet.
PETER goes to the piano. Plays the two highest notes over and over.

PETER
They hate this. I like to torture them. That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!
works a tool
A lot of space. Just you?

DANA
Yes.

PETER
Good.

DANA
What is that thing you're doing?

PETER
It's technical. It's one of our little toys.

DANA
I see. That's the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there.

PETER
What a crime.

DANA
You know, you don't act like a scientist.

PETER
They're usually pretty stiff.

DANA
You're more like a game show host.
The words sting PETER.

PETER
That's the kitchen, huh?

DANA's kitchen

PETER
Dana, are these the eggs?

DANA
Yes, see, I was over there, and the eggs just jumped right out of their shells and started to cook right on the counter.

PETER
That is weird.

DANA
And that's when I to hear that awful noise from the refrigerator.
PETER starts using his tool again
Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way. Would you like to examine the refrigerator?

PETER
I'll check the fridge. Good call. Oh, my God!
DANA is worried
Look at all the junk food!

DANA
No, God damn it! Look, this wasn't here.

PETER
You actually eat this stuff?

DANA
Look! This wasn't here! There was nothing here! There was a space, and there was a building or something with flames coming out of it, and creatures riding around and they were growling and snarling! And there were flames! And I heard a voice say Zuul! It was right here!

PETER
I'm sorry, I'm just not getting any reading.

DANA
Well, are you sure you're using that thing correctly?

PETER
Well, I think so. But I'm sure there are no animals in there.

DANA
Well, that's great. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.

PETER
I don't think you're crazy.

DANA
sarcastically
Good, that makes me feel so much better.

DANA's living room

PETER
Let me tell you something about myself. I come home from work to my place and all I have is my work. There's nothing else in my life!

DANA
Dr. Venkman -

PETER
I meet you, and I say, my God, there's someone with the same problem I have!

DANA
Yes. We both have the same problem. You!

PETER
I'm gonna go for broke. I am madly in love with you.

DANA
I don't believe this. Will you please leave?

PETER
to an invisible audience
And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep, she thought I was a geek and she probably wasn't the first...

DANA
You are so odd... No.

PETER
turning around
I've got it!

DANA
No, no, no, no, no.

PETER
I'll prove myself to you!

DANA
guiding him out
That's not necessary.

PETER
Yeah. I'll solve your little problem.

DANA
Okay...

PETER
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's a guy who can get things done!"

DANA
Right.

PETER
"I wonder what makes him tick!"

DANA
I wonder!

PETER
"I wonder if he'd be interested in knowing what makes me tick?"

DANA
Right!

PETER
I bet you're going to be thinking about me after I'm gone.

DANA
I bet I am!
Pushes him out the door. He sticks his face back in.

PETER
No kiss?
pushes his face out door and slams it shut

Corridor
LOUIS comes out, then tries to go back in, but he's locked himself out. PETER leaves.

Outside Ghostbusters HQ
Night.

Inside Ghostbusters HQ; upstairs
The Ghostbusters dine on takeout Chinese. Music: In The Name Of Love.

PETER
To our first customer.

RAY
To our first and only customer.
They toast with soda cans.

PETER
I got to take out some petty cash. We should take her out to dinner. We don't want to lose her.

RAY
Uh, this magnificent feast here represents the last of the petty cash.

PETER
Slow down. Chew your food.

By JANINE's desk
Phone rings.

JANINE
Hello, Ghostbusters. Yes, of course they're serious. - You do? You have? No kidding?... Uh-huh. Well, just give me the address. Yes, of course. Oh, they'll be totally discreet. Thank you.
hangs up
We got one!
slams down alarm bell

Upstairs

RAY
It's a call!
Music: Cleanin' Up The Town. They slide down the fire pole.

Downstairs
They slide down the fire pole and suit up.

RAY
Come on!

Outside Ghostbusters HQ
Ecto-1 drives off wildly.

Outside Sedgewick Hotel
Ecto-1 drives up. Close-up on Ghostbusters logo.

Lobby of Sedgewick Hotel
The Ghostbusters enter.

PETER
Hey, anybody seen a ghost?
A pretty lady goes by. They all stare appreciatively.

HOTEL MANAGER
Thank you for coming so quickly! The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.

RAY
Has it happened before?

HOTEL MANAGER
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor; the disturbances, I mean. But it's been quiet for years! Up until two weeks ago. It was never, ever this bad, though!

EGON
Did you ever report it to anyone?

HOTEL MANAGER
Heavens! No!

PETER
Oh, no. You kidding?

HOTEL MANAGER
The owners don't even like us to talk about it. I hope we can take care of this. Quietly! Tonight!

RAY
Yes sir, don't worry. We handle this kind of thing all the time!
they go up to an elevator

MAN AT ELEVATOR
What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut?

PETER
No, we're exterminators. Someone saw a cockroach up on twelve.

MAN AT ELEVATOR
That's gotta be some cockroach.

PETER
Bite your head off, man.
elevator arrives

RAY
Going up?

MAN AT ELEVATOR
I'll take the next one.

Elevator

RAY
You know, it just occurred to me, we haven't had a completely successful test of this equipment.

EGON
I blame myself.

PETER
So do I.

RAY
No sense worrying about it now.

PETER
Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.

RAY
Yep. Let's get ready. Switch me on!
EGON charges RAY's proton pack, then backs away

Twelth floor
The Ghostbusters exit the elevator. EGON charges his proton pack.

RAY
Come on.
CHAMBERMAID enters. RAY and EGON shout and blast her cart with proton beams.

PETER
Hold it!

CHAMBERMAID
What the hell are you doing?

EGON
Sorry.

PETER
Sorry.

RAY
I'm sorry.

PETER
We thought you were someone else. Successful test.

RAY
I guess so. I think we'd better split up.

EGON
Good idea.

PETER
Yeah, we can do more damage that way.
EGON goes down a hallway, with his PKE meter.
RAY walks around, smoking. Sees Slimer pigging out at a room service cart. Is shocked. Cigarette falls out of his mouth.

RAY
Venkman! Venkman! Ugh... disgusting blob! I'm going to have to hold it myself...
Charges pack, aims and fires. Startles Slimer. He flies through the wall. Cart smashes a table and a vase.
EGON pokes a man to see if he's a ghost.
PETER sees Slimer. Talks into walkie-talkie.

PETER
Come in, Ray.

RAY
unhooking walkie-talkie
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it! I saw it!

PETER
It's right here, Ray. It's looking at me.

RAY
voice over walkie-talkie
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?

PETER
I think he can hear you, Ray.

RAY
voice over walkie-talkie
Don't move. It won't hurt you.
Slimer flies towards PETER. PETER screams and covers face. RAY runs to help.
Venkman! Venkman! Pete!
RAY arrives. Slimer is gone. PETER is dripping in slime.
Venkman! What happened? Are you okay?

PETER
spitting out slime
He slimed me.

RAY
That's great! Actual physical contact! Can you move?

EGON
voice over walkie-talkie
Ray? Ray! Come in please!

PETER
I feel so funky.

RAY
Spengler! I'm with Venkman! He got slimed!

EGON
That's great, Ray! Save some for me! Get down here right away. It just went into a ballroom!

Lobby
RAY talks to HOTEL MANAGER regarding the bust.

RAY
Okay, sir. If you and your staff will just wait out here, we'll take care of it.

Ballroom
The Ghostbusters hide under a table. RAY scans with his ecto-goggles and sees Slimer near a chandilier.

RAY
There it is, on the ceiling.

PETER
That's the one that got me.
they come out from under table

RAY
All right, boys. Ready? Throw it!
They fire. Slimer flies away. The chandilier falls on a table and smashes.

Lobby
HOTEL MANAGER is worried. He tries to open door. Finds it locked.

Ballroom

RAY
I did that! I did that! That's my fault!

PETER
That's okay. The table broke the fall.

EGON
There's something very important I forgot to tell you.

PETER
What?

EGON
Don't cross the streams.

PETER
Why?

EGON
It would be bad.

PETER
I'm fuzzy on the whole good-bad thing. What do you mean, bad?

EGON
Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.

RAY
Total protonic reversal.

PETER
All right, that's bad, okay. Important safety tip, don't cross the streams. Thanks, Egon. All right. Ray, take the left. Egon, take the right. Okay, Ray. Give me one eye on the outside... Ray!
RAY fires. Slimer screams and flies away.
Egon!
EGON fires. Destroys crystal glasses, a layer cake, etc. Slimer flies behind a bar. EGON fires. Keeps firing even after Slimer flies away.
Okay, all right, hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Whoa! Nice shooting, Tex!
Slimer hides at the ceiling

Lobby

HOTEL MANAGER
I assure you, Mrs. Van Hoffman, there is nothing wrong with the room. It will be ready promptly, in time, as soon as your guests are with us.

Ballroom

RAY
The last throw took something out of him, but he's gonna move! I need some; I need some room to put the trap down. Give me some room.
EGON chucks a table

RAY
We gotta get this in the clear!

PETER
Wait, wait! I always wanted to do this.
pulls tablecloth out from under table, knocking everything but flowers over
And the flowers are still standing!
RAY sends out the trap

RAY
Okay, on my go signal. Spengler, I want a confinement stream from you. Okay? Go!
EGON fires and hits Slimer
Okay, hold him up there. He's gonna move. Hold him up. Go!
PETER fires and hits

EGON
It's working, Ray!

RAY
Start bringing him down. Start bringing him down. You got him. Don't cross the streams.

PETER
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?

EGON
Venkman, shorten your stream! I don't want my face burned off!

RAY
All right. I'm opening the trap now; don't look directly into the trap!
opens trap

EGON
his eyes widening
I looked at the trap, Ray.

RAY
Bring your streams off as soon as I close the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it, now!
Closes trap. PETER and EGON stop firing and look away. Slimer is sucked into trap. The Ghostbusters look at it, keeping their guns pointed at it.

EGON
shoving trap with foot; makes blue lightning
It's in there.

PETER
to Slimer
Hey!

RAY
Well, that wasn't such a chore, now, was it?

Lobby
A crowd has gathered.

HOTEL MANAGER
Mr. Smith, quickly. I want that door open now! Stand over there!

PETER
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

HOTEL MANAGER
Did you see it? What is it?

RAY
We got it!

HOTEL MANAGER
What is it? Will there be any more of them?

RAY
Sir, what you have there is what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal repeating phantasm, or a Class Five full roaming vapor. Real nasty one, too!

PETER
Now, Let's talk seriously, now. For the entrapment, we're gonna have to ask you for four big ones. Four thousand dollars for that. But we are having a special this week on proton charging and storage of the beast, and that's only going to come to one thousand dollars, fortunately.

HOTEL MANAGER
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea it would be so much. I won't pay it.

PETER
Well, that's all right! We can just put it right back in there.

RAY
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

HOTEL MANAGER
No, no, no, no! All right! I'll pay anything!

PETER
Thanks so much.

RAY
Thank you! Hope we can help you again! All right, coming through! Watch out! Class Five full roaming vapor! Watch out!

Outside Carnegie Hall
DANA and VIOLINIST exit the building.

DANA
I don't know where they get these guest conductors. Someone should tell him that it's not going to do much good to scream at us in German.

VIOLINIST
Well, I don't think the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra.
DANA sees PETER

DANA
Um, could you wait here a minute?

VIOLINIST
Uh, sure.

DANA
going to PETER
Dr. Venkman, this is a surprise.

PETER
That was a wonderful rehearsal.

DANA
You heard that?

PETER
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

DANA
Oh, thank you. You're good. Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.

PETER
Hey, I don't have to take this abuse from you. I've got hundreds of people dying to abuse me.

DANA
I know. You're a big celebrity now. Do you have some information on my case?

PETER
indicating VIOLINIST
Who's the stiff?

DANA
The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world! Now do you have some information for me, please?

PETER
Sure, but I'd prefer to give it to you in private.

DANA
Why don't you tell me now?

PETER
Well, okay. I found the name Zuul for you. The name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 BC by the - what's that word?

DANA
Hittites.

PETER
Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.

DANA
reading PETER's notes
Zuul was the minion of Gozer. What's Gozer?

PETER
Gozer was very big in Sumeria. Big guy.

DANA
Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

PETER
I'm working on that. If we could get together Thursday night, I'm thinking nine-ish, you know, we could exchange information.

DANA
I can't see you Thursday, I'm busy!

PETER
Miss Barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here in your mind that says: he enjoys taking his evenings off and spending them with his clients. No. I'm making a special exception in your case. Because... I respect you. It's corny but I respect you as artist. And as a dresser, too! This is a magnificent coordination you have going here today.

DANA
All right. I'll see you Thursday.

PETER
I'll bring The Roylance Guide and we'll eat and read!
DANA and VIOLINIST walk off

VIOLINIST
So! Who the hell was that?

DANA
Just a friend.

VIOLINIST
A friend?

DANA
An old friend.

PETER
Right, I'll see you Thursday! I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir! And I'm glad you're feeling much better. You're still very pale, though! A little sun...

VIOLINIST
What's he do?

DANA
Oh, he's a scientist.

RAY
This is where we put all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap. Quite simple, really. Load a trap here, open, unlock the system. Insert the trap, release, close, lock the system. Set your entry grid, neutralize your field and… the light is green, the trap is clean. The ghost is incarcerated here in a custom-made storage facility.

JANINE's desk

JANINE
There's a man from the EPA here to see you. He's waiting in your office.

PETER
EPA? What's he want?

JANINE
I don't know. All I do know is that I've been working two weeks without a break and you promised me you'd hire more help.

PETER
Janine, someone with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top-flight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries. You gonna answer that?

JANINE
I've quit better jobs than this.

Ghostbusters! What do you want?!

WALTER PECK stands in wait.

PETER
Can I help you?

PECK
I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, the third district.

PETER
Great! How's it going down there?
slaps PECK on back

PECK
Are you Peter Venkman?

PETER
Yes, I'm Dr. Venkman.

PECK
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

PETER
Well, I have PhD's in parapsychology and psychology.

PECK
I see. And now you catch ghosts?

PETER
Yeah, you could say that.

PECK
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?

PETER
I'm not at liberty to say.

PECK
And where do you put these ghosts, once you catch them?

PETER
In a storage facility.

PECK
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?

PETER
Yes.

PECK
And may I see this storage facility?

PETER
No.

PECK
And why not, Mr. Venkman?

PETER
Because you did not use the magic word.

PECK
What is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?

PETER
Please!

PECK
May I please see the storage facility?

PETER
Why do you want to see the storage facility?

PECK
Well, because I'm curious. I want to know more about what you do here! Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess for any possible environmental impact from your operation! For instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement! Now you either show me what is down there or I come back with a court order.

PETER
You go get a court order! And I'll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution.

PECK
You can have it your way, Mr. Venkman.

Basement

EGON
I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the horizon.

WINSTON
What do you mean, big?

EGON
Well. Let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. According this morning's sample, it would be a Twinkie thirty-five feet long weighing approximately six hundred pounds.
RAY coughs violently

WINSTON
That's a big Twinkie.
EGON nods and eats his Twinkie.

RAY
We could be on the verge of a fourfold crossrip! A PKE surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions!

PETER
coming down stairs
We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency. How's the grid holding up?

RAY
Not good.

WINSTON
Tell him about the Twinkie.

PETER
What about the Twinkie?

Hello, Louis.

LOUIS
You gotta come in here! You're missing a classic party!

DANA
Yes, well, I would, Louis. But I have a date.

LOUIS

You made a date tonight?

DANA
Well, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

LOUIS
Well, that's okay. You can bring him along!

DANA
All right, maybe we'll stop by. Okay?

LOUIS
That's great, I'll tell everybody you're coming. We're gonna play Twister and we're gonna do some break dancing. Hey, everybody -

Hello? Oh, hi Mom. - I've been busy. - No, everything is fine. Just that one time. - I will. - I won't. - Mom, I have to go. I have a date. - Yes. - No, no one you know. It's, um- Well, he's a Ghostbuster. Those guys on TV. - Yes, well, I'll have to let you know. Love to Dad. Right. Bye. - Bye!
Hangs up. Growling noise.
Oh shit.

WOMAN AT PARTY
Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength Tylenol?

LOUIS
Gee, I think all I got is this cedacelacytic acid. Generic. See, I can get six hundred tablets of that for the same price as three hundred of the name brand. Makes good financial sense. Good advice. Hey, this is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia, Canada, $24.95 a pound. It only cost me $14.12 after tax, though. I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense. That's why I invited clients instead of friends. You having a good time, Marv? How ya doing? Why don't you have some of the Brie? It's at room temperature! You think it's too warm in here for the Brie?

TALL WOMAN AT PARTY
Louis, I'm going home.

LOUIS
Oh, don't leave yet. Listen, maybe if we start dancing, other people will join in.

TALL WOMAN AT PARTY
Okay!

Oh, don't move. I just gotta get the door.

PETER knocks on DANA's door.

PETER
Hello?
DANA has become ZUUL. Eerie music plays. She has wild hair and a bright orange dress.
That's a different look for you, isn't it?

DANA
Are you the Keymaster?

PETER
Not that I know of.
She slams door in his face. He knocks again.

DANA
Are you the Keymaster?

PETER
Yes.

Inside DANA's apartment

PETER
I'm a friend of his. He told me to meet him here. I didn't get your name.

DANA
I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.

PETER
What are we doing today, Zuul?

DANA
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.

PETER
Gozer, huh?

DANA
The Destructor.

PETER
Are we still going out? You know, you could pick up the place if you're expecting someone.

DANA
flops on bed, writhing up and down
Do you want this body?

PETER
Is this a trick question? I guess the roses worked, huh.

DANA
Take me now, subcreature.

PETER
We never talk any more.
DANA grabs him and pulls him down
I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people. Actually, it's more of a guideline than a rule.
she rolls them over

DANA
I want you inside me.

PETER
Go ahead! No, I can't, sounds like you've already got at least two people in there already.
breaks free
Might a little crowded. Now, why don't you quit trying to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman and just relax. Lie down there, relax. Put your hands on your chest. Yes. What I'd like to do is talk to Dana. I wanna talk to Dana. Dana? It's Peter.

DANA
There is no Dana. There is only Zuul.

PETER
Whoa, Zuulie you nut. Now come on. Come on. I want to talk to Dana. Dana, Dana. Relax, come on. Dana, Dana. Can I talk to Dana?
DANA smiles a vicious smile. The voice of ZUUL eminates from her.

ZUUL
There is no Dana, only Zuul!

PETER
What a lovely singing voice you must have. Now I'm going to count to three, Zuulie, and if I don't get to hear Dana, there's going to be some real trouble in this apartment, I think. One! Two!
DANA's eyes flutter and turn white
Two and a half!
The voice of ZUUL screams. DANA rises above the bed.
Please come down.
ZUUL roars

Just a moment.
EGON comes out with JANINE

POLICE CAPTAIN
You a Ghostbuster?

EGON
Yes.

POLICE CAPTAIN
We picked up this guy, now we don't know what to do with him. Bellevue doesn't want him and I'm afraid to put him in the lock-up. And I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we'd check with you.

EGON
All right.
LOUIS is in the van in a straight jacket.

LOUIS
Are you the Gatekeeper?
EGON runs a PKE meter over LOUIS and watches the readings climb

EGON
You'd better bring him inside.

JANINE
You are so kind to take care of that poor man. You know, you're a real humanitarian.

EGON
I don't think he's human.

Ghostbusters HQ lab

EGON
What'd you say your name was?

LOUIS
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

JANINE
looking at LOUIS's wallet
Well, according to this, his name's Louis Tully. Lives on Central Park West. Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

LOUIS
Do I?

EGON
Yes, have some.

LOUIS
Yes, have some.

EGON
Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign. What sign are you waiting for?

LOUIS
Gozer the Traveler! He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the Rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Traveler came as a large and moving Torb! Then, during the Third Reconciliation of the Last of the Meketrex Supplicants, they chose a new form for him, that of a giant Sloar! Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of a Sloar that day, I can tell you!

JANINE
Egon?

EGON

Excuse me.

JANINE
There's something very strange about that man...
LOUIS is sniffing a jar of popcorn
Listen, I'm usually very psychic, and I'm have a terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you. I'm afraid you're going to die.
EGON holds JANINE in his arms. Phone rings. LOUIS jumps.

EGON
I'll get it!
Picks up. LOUIS drags the rest of the phone over to him.
Hello? Thanks, I've got it.

DANA's apartment

PETER
Egon, it's Peter. I have some news from the world of Gozer.

EGON
over phone
What is it, Peter?

PETER
I'm here with Dana Barrett. It seems that the Goz' has been putting some moves on my would-be girlfriend!

EGON
How is she?

PETER
I think we can get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom. I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of thorozine. She's going to take a little nap now. She says she's the Gatekeeper, does that make any sense to you?

Ghostbusters HQ

EGON
Some. I've just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now.

PETER
over phone
Oh, wonderful, we have to get these two together.
LOUIS takes a slice of pizza, sniffs it and sticks it on his cheek

EGON
I think that would be extraordinarily dangerous.

PETER
Okay, well, hold on to him. I'll be over there in a little while.

EGON
Good.
LOUIS takes phone from EGON.
Thank you, Vinz.

Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?

Never met him.

WINSTON
Yeah, well I do. And I love Jesus's style, you know.

RAY
... this roof cap is made of a magnesium-tungsten alloy...

WINSTON
What are you so involved in there?

RAY
These are the blueprints for the structural ironwork for Dana's apartment building, and they're very, very strange.

WINSTON
Hey, Ray. Do you remember something in the Bible about the last days, when the dead would rise from the grave?

RAY
I remember Revelation 7:12. And I looked, as he opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became as black as sackcloth. And the moon became as blood.

WINSTON
And the seas boiled and the skies fell.

RAY
Judgment Day.

WINSTON
Judgment Day.

RAY
Every ancient religion has its own myth about the end of the world.

WINSTON
Myth? Ray, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason we've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from the grave?

Oh no, hold on! I've seen TV, I know you can't come in here without a writ or warrant or something!

PECK
brandishing manila folder
Cease and desist all commerce order, seizure of premises and chattels, ban on use of public utilities for unauthorized waste handlers, and a federal entry and inspection order.

Basement

EGON
Vinz, there's one more test I'd like to perform -
JANINE runs down. PECK, POLICE CAPTAIN and CON EDISON MAN follow.

JANINE
Egon, I tried to stop them! He says they have a warrant.

EGON
Excuse me, this is private property!

PECK
pointing out ecto-containment unit
Shut this off. Shut these all off.

EGON
I'm warning you, turning off these machines would be extremely hazardous.

PECK
I'll tell you what's hazardous. You're facing federal prosecution for at least half a dozen environmental violations. Now either you shut these beams off or we shut them off for you.

Outside Ghostbusters HQ
A taxi drops PETER off.

Ghostbusters HQ; basement

EGON
Try to understand. This is a high voltage laser containment system. Simply turning it off would be like dropping a bomb on the city.

PECK
Don't patronize me! I'm not grotesquely stupid like the people you bilk!

PETER
coming down stairs
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman. I think there's just been a slight misunderstanding and I wanna to cooperate in any way that I can.

PECK
Forget it, Venkman! You had your chance to cooperate, but you thought it'd be more fun to insult me. Well, now it is my turn, wise ass.

EGON
He wants to shut down the protection grid, Peter.

PETER
You shut that thing down and we are not going to be held responsible for whatever happens.

PECK
On the contrary! You're going to be held responsible.

PETER
No! We won't be held responsible!

PECK
Shut it off!

PETER
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

CON EDISON MAN
I - I've never seen anything like this before.

PECK
I'm not interested in your opinion, just shut it off.

PETER
stopping CON EDISON MAN
My friend, don't be a jerk.

POLICE CAPTAIN
Step aside!

PECK
If he does that again, you can shoot him.

POLICE CAPTAIN
You do your job, pencil neck! Don't tell me how to do mine!

PETER
Thank you, officer.

PECK
Shut it off!
PETER starts up stairs. EGON makes an explosion with his fingers in POLICE CAPTAIN's face, mouthing "Boom".
CON ED MAN pulls red lever. Alarms goes off. Lights flash.

DANA's apartment
DANA trembles.

Ghostbusters HQ; basement
Walls tremble. Bricks pop out. Everyone starts running.

CON EDISON MAN
Oh shit.

Ghostbusters HQ; entrance
Everyone runs like hell.

EGON
Clear the building!

Outside Ghostbusters HQ
LOUIS runs out. The door of the fire house is smoking. The roof explodes.

DANA's apartment
DANA is jolted awake.

Outside Ghostbusters HQ
Explosion. Pink strams of psychokinetic energy zap out. Crowd gathers.

LOUIS
This is it! This is the sign!
walks away

JANINE
Yeah, it's a sign all right; we're going out of business.
Ecto-1 drives up. Police start to arrive.

RAY
What happened?

EGON
The storage facilities blew. He shut off the protection grid.

RAY
Oh, great.

WINSTON
That's bad, isn't it?

RAY
Yeah.

PETER
Where's the Keymaster?

EGON
Shit!

RAY
Who's the Keymaster?

EGON
Come on!
The Ghoustbusters run. PECK and some police stop them.

PECK
Hold it! I want this man arrested. Captain, these men are in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act, and this explosion is a direct result of it!

EGON
Your mother -
They fight. Police try to keep order.
The ghosts keep pouring out of the fire house roof.
Music: Magic.

New York City
The pink streams fly over the city.

DANA's apartment
DANA goes to her window, grinning.

Outside subway tunnel
LOUIS passes. Papers fly around. A blue creature rises up out of tunnel.

By taxi
Pink smoke enters a taxi's exhaust. BUSINESSMAN IN CAB enters.

BUSINESSMAN IN CAB
Columbia Building, 53rd street, and I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

Jail

WINSTON
Hey, guard! I want to make a phone call! I just work with these guys! I wasn't even there!
RAY and EGON look over blueprints

EGON
The structure of this roof cap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.

RAY
Cold riveted girders with cores of pure selenium.

PETER
to other jailbirds
Everyone getting this so far? So what? I guess they just don't make them like they used to.

RAY
No! Nobody ever made them like this! The architect was either a certified genius or an aesthetic wacko!

PETER
Ray, for a moment, pretend that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering or physics and just tell me what the hell is going on.

RAY
You never studied. The whole building is a huge super-conductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. Your girlfriend, Pete, lives in the corner penthouse of Spook Central.

PETER
She's not my girlfriend. I find her interesting because she's a client and because she sleeps above her covers. Four feet above her covers! She barks, she drools, she claws...

EGON
It's not the girl, Peter, it's the building! Something terrible is about the enter our world and this building is obviously the door. The architect's name was Ivo Shandor. I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide. He was also a doctor. Performed a lot of unnecessary surgery. And then in 1920 he founded a secret society.

PETER
Let me guess. Gozer worshippers.

EGON
Right.

PETER
No studying!

EGON
After the First World War, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone. he had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals up on the roof, bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world, and now it looks like it may actually happen!

PETER
singing
So be good, for goodness sake! Whoa! Somebody's coming! Somebody's coming!

RAY
We have to get out of here. We've gotta get a judge or something.

WINSTON
Hey! Hey! Hold it! Now we going to actually going to go before a federal judge and say that some moldy old Babylonian god is going to drop in on Central Park West and start tearing up the city?

RAY
Sumerian, not Babylonian.

PETER
Yeah, big difference!

WINSTON
No offense, guys, but I gotta get my own lawyer.

JAIL GUARD
Okay, Ghostbusters! The mayor wants to see you guys. The whole island's going crazy! Let's go.

PETER
to other jailbirds
I gotta split. The mayor wants to rap with me about some things.

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
LOUIS walks by. Shocked. Looks up to the top.

Remnants of DANA's apartment

LOUIS
I am the Keymaster!

DANA
I am the Gatekeeper.
they kiss, then go up the stairs to the Temple of Zuul

Outside City Hall
Police escort Ghostbusters to the MAYOR. Reporters and photographers try to get press. Music: Savin' The Day.

POLICE CAPTAIN
Stay back! Stay back!

Inside MAYOR's office

MAYOR
I got a city blowing up, and you guys are not giving me any answers!

POLICE COMMISIONER
All right. We're blocking the bridges, the roads. I mean -

MAYOR'S AIDE
The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor.

MAYOR
The Ghostbusters, all right, the Ghostbusters. Hey, where's this Peck?

PECK
I am Walter Peck, sir, and I'm prepared to make a full report. These men are consummate snowball artists! They use sensitive nerve gases to induce hallucinations. People think they're seeing ghosts! And they call these bozos, who conveniently show up to deal with the problem with a fake electronic light show!

RAY
Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here.

PECK
They caused an explosion!

MAYOR
Is this true?

PETER
Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.
PECK lunges at PETER. Police try to break up fight.

POLICE SERGEANT
Break it up, break it up!

PETER
Well, that's what I heard!

MAYOR
This is City Hall! Now what am I gonna do here, John? What is this?

FIRE COMMISIONER
All I know is: that was no light show we saw this morning. I've seen every kind of combustion known to man, but this beats the hell out of me.

POLICE COMMISIONER
The walls in the 53rd precinct were bleeding. How do you explain that?

ARCHBISHOP
entering
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

MAYOR
Oh... Your Eminence!
kisses ARCHBISHOP's ring

ARCHBISHOP
How are you, Lenny?

MAYOR
You're looking good, Mike.
gives ARCHBISHOP a friendly slap
We're in a real fix, here. What do you think I should do?

ARCHBISHOP
Lenny, officially, the Church will not take any position on the religious implications of these phenomena. Personally, Lenny, I think it's a sign from God. But don't quote me on that.

MAYOR
I think that's a smart move, Mike. But I'm not gonna call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying.

WINSTON
I'm Winston Zeddemore, Your Honor. Look, I've only been with the company for a couple of weeks. But I gotta tell you, these things are real. Since I joined these men, I've seen shit that'll turn you white!

PETER
Well, you could believe Mr. Pecker.

PECK
My name is Peck!

PETER
Or you could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.

MAYOR
What do you mean, biblical?

RAY
What he means is Old Testament biblical, Mr. Mayor. Real wrath-of-God-type stuff. Fire and brimstone coming from the sky! Rivers and seas boiling!

EGON
Forty years of darkness! Earthquakes! Volcanoes!

WINSTON
The dead rising from the grave!

PETER
Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!

MAYOR
Enough! I get the point! What if you're wrong?

PETER
If I'm wrong, nothing happens! We go to jail. Peacefully, quietly. We'll enjoy it! But if I'm right, and we can stop this thing; Lenny, you will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.
MAYOR smiles. ARCHBISHOP nods.

PECK
all the wind sucked out of his sails
I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to these men.
PETER smiles a smug smile.

MAYOR
Get him out of here.

PETER
waving
Bye.

PECK
I'll fix you, Venkman. I'm gonna fix you!

PETER
I am going to send you a nice fruit basket. I'm gonna miss him!

PECK
All right, all right!

MAYOR
You've got work to do. Now what do you need from me?

The streets of New York
Music: Savin' The Day. The streets are clear, but the sidewalks are jammed with people waving signs and cheering. Military and police personnel yell things. The Ghostbusters wait in Ecto-1 with their police escort.

PETER
Come on, let's run some red lights!
The cars start moving.

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
Dark clouds gather atop the building, shrouding the Temple of Zuul. The police escort drives up. The Ghostbusters get out and suit up. The crowd cheers.

PETER
Hello, New York! Well, hi, everyone!
raises RAY's hand high
Dr. Ray Stantz! Would you please? The heart of the Ghostbusters! Thank you. They love you. They love you here!
walks down the sidewalk, shaking and kissing hands
I like that shirt, pal! Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost! All right, whatever happens, let's be professionals.
The Ghostbusters assemble in front of the building, looking up at the darkness above. Lightning strikes the building.

RAY
We might have to put a little overtime in on this one!
Earthquake! A water main breaks. People fall and scream. A pit opens below the Ghostbusters. They fall in. So does the front end of a police car. The earthquake suddenly stops. The crowd comes to its feet.

PEOPLE IN CROWD
Are you all right?
Ghostbusters?
Are they all right?
A dazed RAY pops out of the hole
There they are!
the others climb out of the hole
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

PETER
We're all right, it's all right, we can take it! You gotta learn to play rough! You wanna play rough?

RAY
Yeah!

WINSTON
Let's go!
Music: Savin' The Day. They grab hands, pushing down, then up, and go into building

Ivo Shandor Building; many flights of stairs
They groan as they climb the stairs.

PETER
Where are we?

RAY
Oh, it looks like we're in the teens somewhere.

PETER
Well, when we get to twenty, tell me. I'm gonna throw up.

Temple of Zuul
DANA and LOUIS stand on terror dog pedestals. Lightning shoots between them and the gates to the spirit world. The gates open up.

Floor 22

RAY
Twenty-two. Is this it?

PETER
Yeah.

EGON
Art Deco. Very nice.

RAY
Where is it?

PETER
It's at the end of the hall.

Remnants of DANA's apartment
RAY points out the stairs to the Temple of Zuul.

RAY
Hey, where do these stairs go?

PETER
They go up.
He's about to go upstairs. Lightning goes off. He pushes his friends on.
Okay. Go ahead. Come on, go ahead. Come on. Go ahead!

Temple of Zuul
The Ghostbusters arrive. Lightning strikes DANA and LOUIS.

PETER
Dana!
DANA and LOUIS turn into terror dogs
Okay. That's all. She's a dog.
The Ghostbusters line up in front of the temple. GOZER emerges from the temple.

RAY
It's a girl.
GOZER pets the terror dogs

EGON
It's Gozer.

WINSTON
I thought Gozer was a man.

EGON
It's whatever it wants to be.

PETER
Well, whatever it is, it's gotta get by us!

RAY
Right!

PETER
Go get her, Ray!
RAY steps up

RAY
Gozer the Gozerian! Good evening! As a duly designated representative of the state, county and city of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension!

PETER
That ought to do it. Thanks very much, Ray.

GOZER
Are you a god?
PETER nods "yes" to RAY

RAY
No.

GOZER
reaching its arms back into the temple
Then... die!
Fires lightning at the Ghostbusters. They sail across the temple, clinging to the edge of the building.

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
Crowd screams.

Temple of Zuul

WINSTON
Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say, "Yes!"
RAY nods

PETER
All right. This chick is toast!
they march up to the temple
Got your stick?

PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON
unhooking proton guns
Holding!

PETER
Heat 'em up!

PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON
charging guns
Smoking!

PETER
Make 'em hard!

PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON
Ready!

PETER
Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown. Strike!
They blast GOZER. It yowls and flips across the temple.
Nimble little minx, isn't she? Aim for the flat top!
They blast again. GOZER vanishes.
Well! That wasn't so hard.

RAY
We neutralized it! You know what that means? A complete particle reversal!

WINSTON
Hey, we have the tools, we have the talent!

PETER
It's Miller time!

EGON
looking at PKE meter
Ray? This looks extraordinarily bad.
Earthquake at the temple. Rocks fall.
Look out!

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
Rocks fall. Crowd screams.

Temple of Zuul
Voice of GOZER sounds.

GOZER
Subcreatures! Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Volguus Zildrohar, the Traveler, has come! Choose and perish!

RAY
What do you mean, choose? We don't understand!

GOZER
Choose! Choose the form of the Destructor!

PETER
Whoa! I get it, I get it. Very cute! Whatever we think of - if we think of J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover will appear and destroy us, okay? So empty your heads. Empty your heads. Don't think of anything. We've only got one shot at this.

GOZER
The choice is made! The Traveler has come!

PETER
Whoa! Whoa! Nobody choosed anything! Did you choose anything?

EGON
No!

PETER
Did you?

WINSTON
My mind's totally blank!

PETER
I didn't choose anything!
PETER, EGON and WINSTON stare at RAY

RAY
trembling
I couldn't help it. It just popped in there!

PETER
What? What just popped in there?

RAY
I - I tried to think -
stomping and screaming from below

EGON
Look!

RAY
No! It can't be!

WINSTON
What is it?

RAY
It can't be!

WINSTON
What did you do, Ray?

RAY
It can't be!

WINSTON
Aw, shit!

RAY
solemnly
It's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.

Outside Shandor Building
Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man stomps cars as people run and scream in terror.

Temple of Zuul

PETER
Well, there's something you don't see every day.

RAY
I tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay-Puft...

PETER
Nice thinking, Ray.

RAY
We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows, by the fire at Camp Waconda!

PETER
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon. What have you got left?

EGON
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.
Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man growls at them.

WINSTON
Oh, no.

PETER
Mother pus-bucket!

Outside Shandor Building
PECK keeps his distance from the marshmallow man. It stomps on a church.

Temple of Zuul

PETER
Nobody steps on a church in my town!

RAY
One, two, three! Roast him!
They blast Mr. Stay-Puft. It puts him on fire which soars up to them. He climbs up the side of the building.

PETER
Whoa...
they run and hide

RAY
Funny, us going out like this. Killed by a hundred-foot marshmallow man.

PETER
We've been going about this all wrong! This Mr. Stay-Puft isn't so bad. He's a sailor, he's in New York; we get this guy laid, we won't have any trouble!
marshmallow man continues scaling up the side of building

EGON
I have a radical idea. The door swings both ways. We could reverse the particle flow through the gate.

PETER
How?

EGON
We'll cross the streams.

PETER
Excuse me, Egon, you said crossing the streams was bad.

RAY
Cross the streams...

PETER
You're gonna endanger us, you're gonna endanger our client. The nice lady who paid us in advance before she became a dog.

EGON
Not necessarily. There's definitely a very slim chance we'll survive.

PETER
giving RAY a friendly slap
I love this plan! I'm excited to be a part of it. Let's do it!

WINSTON
This job is definitely not worth eleven-five a year!
they run to the temple just as Mr. Stay-Puft lifts his head up

EGON
Hurry!

PETER
See you on the other side, Ray.
fires

RAY
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
Fires. They cross the streams.
Let's turn 'em on, Spengler!
EGON and WINSTON fire
Cross 'em now, Spengler!
Mr. Stay-Puft sees what's going on. He screams. The four proton beams combine to make one big one, blasting right into the temple. The gates swing shut.

PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON
shouting randomly
Aggh! Oh, no! Help! It's gonna blow! Let's get out of here!
They stop firing and run away.
The Temple of Zuul explodes. Mr. Stay-Puft does as well.

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
Marshmallow spatters all over. PECK looks up just in time to see a big glob splatter on him. He yells and curses at the sky.

Remnants of Temple of Zuul
Marshmallow all over everything, including RAY and WINSTON.

RAY
Oh... oh... Winston? Are you all right?

WINSTON
Yeah, yeah.
they laugh

RAY
Venkman? Spengler? Venkman? Spengler?
EGON, covered in marshmallow, enters
Oh, Spengler, are you okay?

EGON
I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.
PETER enters. He has very little marshmallow on him.

RAY
Venkie!

PETER
Yeah. I'm all right.

RAY
Thank God. You okay?

EGON
I'm all right.

RAY
You all right?

PETER
I'm all right.

RAY
You okay?

PETER
Fine...
Walks away. Comes across remnants of terror dog statue.

RAY
Oh. Smells like barbecued dog hair. Oh... Venkman. Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I... I just forgot.
PETER walks away sadly. Then part of the statue breaks off. A hand reaches out.

DANA
Mm...

RAY
Look!
The Ghostbusters break open the statue, and PETER lifts DANA out.
LOUIS, with a terror dog statue head on his head, walks around helplessly.

LOUIS
Somebody turn on the lights! Help! Somebody turn on the lights!

PETER
Go check on that little guy!
RAY, EGON and WINSTON go to help them. They remove the terror dog head.

LOUIS
What happened?

DANA
coming to
Oh... oh... oh... where am I?
opens eyes, sees PETER
Oh... hi...

EGON
regarding LOUIS
He'll be all right.

LOUIS
Boy, the superintendent's gonna be pissed.

RAY
Are you okay?

LOUIS
Who are you guys?

RAY
We're the Ghostbusters.

LOUIS
Who does your taxes?
PETER leads DANA away. RAY, EGON and LOUIS start to walk off.

RAY
You know, Mr. Tully, you are a most fortunate individual!

LOUIS
I know.

RAY
You have been a participant in the biggest interdimensional crossrip since the Tunguska blast of 1909!

LOUIS
Felt great!

EGON
We'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue.

LOUIS
Okay.

WINSTON
throwing up hands and cheering
I love this town!

Outside Ivo Shandor Building
Music: Ghostbusters. The crowd cheers for the Ghostbusters. PETER gives DANA a long kiss on the lips. RAY takes a puff on a cigarette as he waves. PETER escorts DANA into Ecto-1. EGON leaves building. JANINE runs into his arms.

JANINE
Egon!
They kiss. He pats her cheeks. LOUIS comes out, waving.

LOUIS
What's going on? Does anyone wanna interview me? I'm an eyewitness. I was up there!
Red Cross employees take him off, but LOUIS protests.
I wanna go with them, in the car.

WINSTON puts his proton pack away. The Ghostbusters get into Ecto-1 and the crowd parts to let them through. As Ecto-1 drives off, the crowd chases after it.
Slimer flies above the crowd, screaming, and flies into the camera. Fade to black. Final credits roll.

The End
